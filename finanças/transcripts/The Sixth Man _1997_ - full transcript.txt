Antoine, son, how many times I got to tell ya? Don't knock the ball into the parking lot. - Yes, Dad. - Nice shot. All right, fellas. Listen up. This is what it is. Down by one point, 28 seconds to go. That means we gotta get the ball back. Make 'em give it up. - Understand? - Yes. I want Kenny to take the shot. - Let me take it. - No, this one's on Kenny. - Aw, Dad! Kenny's gonna miss it. - Antoine! But that guy's all over me. What if I can't get open for a shot? Henry, can you set a pick for him? It's all it takes. - Aw, Henry's wack. - Antoine, get serious. Henry's gonna set the pick. You gonna take the shot. You gonna bring it up. All right? Now, give me some hands. Hands! Last chance. Get real. Together) Win! Now, let's get out there and beat somebody! You want me to shoot... to win the game? Me? I want you to shoot to win. You can do it, son. A &K! All the way! - Oh, man. - Mom! A & K! All the way! Okay, boys. Let's play some ball. Kenny! Go, Kenny! Take the shot, Kenny! Go, go, go! Kenny! Go! Shoot it! What? All right. All right. Oh! - Oh. - I can't believe that. It was so close. You played great, guys. - Come on, bro. - Sorry, man. You'll get it next time, guys. - I should have made that thing. - It's all right. It's all right. Hold them heads up. It's all right. You're still my boys. Come on, man. Give me the ball. Just give me the ball. All right. - Can't you see I'm in the zone? Just pass the ball. - All right. You missed a layup. So what? So what? So what? Man, we lost. We lost because of me. I don't get it. I had 'im with the Antoine look-away. I had my tongue hangin' out like Mike. There's no way that shot doesn't drop. Unless that tongue's got some aerodynamic properties I don't know about... it's not gonna help you make a layup. That's what I was telling you. - Them aerodynamic properties. - Tell it to Mike. Come on, James. Those two need to come inside, get their homework done and go to bed. Aw, Mom. Just a couple more minutes. I was about to get a chance to shoot. - Don't "Aw, Mom" me. - Give us a minute, sweetheart. Look, if you play the game with passion and dignity... it'll take you anywhere you want to go. Cut it out. Hook up. All you boys got to do is stick together. You do that, anything can happen. You understand what that means? Anything! - All right. Go on inside. - Aw, Dad! Go inside. Get in the house... before your mom come out here and snatch us. Hey, hold up, little man. You know, I think you would have made that shot today. You got to have faith, Kenny. It's in here, man. Right here. You just got to trust it. Right? - Go on inside. - Okay. - Take Murphy with ya. - All right. Come on, Murphy. Let's go. If you help me do my homework, I'll get you a biscuit. And Kenny Tyler serves up the alley-oop. And Antoine Tyler slams it home. - Oh-oh! - That's the one-two punch. - The Tyler brothers cannot be stopped. - A & K, all the way! That was a no-look pass from Kenny Tyler... - Wow. And a double-fisted, slam-bam, thank you, ma'am from Antoine Tyler. That's brought the Huskies within one of the Wildcats. 78-77. That's a 10-1 run. Olson is gonna call a time-out to regroup. Bernie, what else can we say about this kid? A lot, Ernie. A lot. There's no question he's the reason... the Huskies are 19 and 6. Antoine Tyler just will not allow this team to lose. Virtually overlooked in the preseason polls, they have scraped... and clawed their way to a tie atop the Pac-10 standings. You did a little scraping and clawing yourself last night there, Bernie. Incidentally, if they win the Pac-10... it'll be the first time since 1985. And that is a long, long, long, long time to wait. Here's Harry the Husky to attempt his patented slam dunk. Let's give him a big hand, folks. Let's cross our fingers too. Huskies! Harry the Husky on the run. And the fly. Whoa! He split the crossbeams on that one. Hey, guys, did-- Did we make it? Huskies! Yeah! Okay, we were 15 down at the half. We fought like hell to get back in this thing. So let's not run outta steam, all right? - We gotta force a turnover. Malik? - Hmm? Malik, what are those? Are those shorts or a pair of damn hip huggers? Yo, Coach, it's the '90s. It's a style thing. Here's my style thing. I want you all over McCanless. - All right. - He goes to the crapper... I want you standing beside him ready to wipe. I got him. Let's go. - Zigi. Rodman. Listen. - Huh? You're the last line. They get a breakaway bucket, I'm gonna have you back in Siberia. - It is Serbia, Coach. - Whatever. Now, listen, double down on their guards. I want them to think we're playin' with eight guys out there. - They make it past half-court, they're gonna win. - Yeah! - Danny? - Yeah, Coach? The game is getting intense... but don't hit anybody. Not unless they deserve it, Coach! Hey, hey, Coach. Put me in. Jimmy, sit down. Now, Kenny, we need that ball. Go get it for us. - You got it. - Are you boys ready for this? - Focus, baby. - You ready to win? - 'Cause it's up to you. come on! - Let's go! - Let's go, baby! - Let's go, baby. Let's go! - Coach, is that a new coat? - Yeah. Still got the receipt? Ha, ha. No jokin' around. You're my guy. You're my guy too, Coach. No jokes. We got this one. - Hey, Dawgs up! - Woof! Woof! Woof! - Let's kick some ass! - Yeah! Kenny Tyler with a no-look alley-oop... and Antoine Tyler 360 for the slam. And the Huskies win it 79-78! Somebody slam the refrigerator door. The butter's melting. Antoine Tyler, he's a first-round draft choice. Count on it. We'll see ya next week at Pauley Pavilion... when the Huskies meet the Bruins to clinch first place in the Pac-10. Mom! You got it. You know you got it. Oh, gosh. Your father would have been so proud of you both today. - I wish he could have seen you play. - So do we, Ma. But his spirit lives on in you. - Hey, Ma? - What? Dawgs up! Woof! Woof! Woof! - Aah! - Ow! Ow! Yo, you know what this game is about? It's about lookin' good. It's a style thing. You know what I love about this game? It's so physical. I love contact. You know how I see myself? I see myself as the African ambassador of basketball. - Hello, ladies. I'm Zigi. - Hi. Zigi Hrbacek. I'm from Serbia. - I play for U-Dub. I am seven feet tall. - Whoo! Tonight was an off night. I had 30 points. I believe, 15 assists, 12 rebounds. - Stubbs, you never play. - The reason-- Oh, you probably had bad seats. No, Stubbs. I go to every game. This guy never plays. Whoo! - Hey, Dawg! - My boy, right there! - You're okay. Hey, what's up? Can I have a pitcher of beer, please? - You got it, Kenny. - Thank you. - You go, R.C. - Looks good. Whoo! Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars! Easy money! Easy cheese. - - Oh, ho! - Here you go, my boy. Ooh. Hey, man! Antoine, man. He'll take us all the way to N.C.A.A. blindfolded. - Shoot the ball blindfolded. - Yeah! - And I-- - Get your nasty ass outta here! Whoa! Okay, okay. - Oh! - No, that's it. Whoo! - Where am I at? - Come on, bro. Shoot it. What? What the-- I am so-- I am so sorry-- I am-- I am so sorry. Ha. Sorry. It's over there. What? Huh? Can you believe that 7-foot Serbian tried to pay me in traveler's checks? Boom. Why you takin' that man's drachmas or whatever they is called? I need 'em. That's why. Come on. - Lucky shot, man. Lucky shot. - Danny, don't even try it. I'll shoot 'em with you all day. Have a little shot, Toine. I bought you a drink. I bought you a drink, Toine. Sit your drunk ass down. Hey, Cheryl. What's happenin', baby? I was just gettin' ready to call you. - Yeah? - Yeah. What happened? Dialing a phone cramps your shooting hand? - No. We just got this tournament comin' up. - Right. Oh. Tryin' to keep my edge. Wouldn't want me to lose my edge. Oh, no, Antoine. I don't want you losin' your edge. 'Cause, uh, I ain't gonna be around to help you find it. Come on. Hold on. Hold on. Come on, girl. What you mean? - You not gonna be around? - No, I'm not gonna be around. - You're really not gonna be around? - No, I'm not gonna be around. - Ah. - Well, you know. - A little somethin'. - Little somethin'? - Yeah. - You'll be around for me? - Yeah. - Okay. I'll give you some. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. - That's my girl. I'm crazy about you. - You better be. - Crazy about you, girl. - Later, baby. Crazy about you, girl! What you doin'? You ain't gonna treat her right, cut the girl loose. Oh, stop it. Don't tell me nothin' about females. Stick to Nintendo. Aw, come on! What are you sayin'? Your problem is, you scared to play. Look here. I wrote the book on mackin', baby. - Really? - Okay? And with these hands. - Prove it to me then. - What? Hell. I will bet you $10... you pick any broad in this club, I'll get that number tonight. Okay. Well, let me pick 'em out. Hey, no midgets, no cockeyed broads and no toothless chicks. - Cute ones. - Ooh-ooh! Found her. - Where? - At the bar. Cutie pie. - Which one? - Four o'clock. Red bones, red bones. Nice! - You gotta pick somebody else, Kenny. - That's your type. Okay, I'm just tryin' to make this a fair bet. Better yet. I'll go down there and pull her. She'll make us eggs in the morning and clean house. You're tryin' to play me. I'm gonna show you a real mack, baby. - You're gonna show me? - You can call me golden, man. Okay, go ahead. I'm gonna sit up here and watch you with your mack daddy, crisscross ass. - I'll bet a long island iced tea. - I'm betting too. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Watch it! Excuse my back. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. You know me? - Damn! - Hey! Hey! Ha. For a guy with 11 assists and eight rebounds, you sure got a set of clumsy hands. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, well. Sorry. I take it you saw the game tonight. - You looked good. - Thank you. Been working out. Your game. You looked good. Oh. Pow! Damn. That hurt. - How you doin'? I'm the wounded Kenny Tyler. - I know. Bit of advice, Kenny Tyler. Shouldn't make bets you can't win. Wait. Hold up. - Wait. Hold on. What's your name? - R.C. St. John! R.C., I'm sorry about your purse! See that girl there with the bloody nose? Got kicked out of the game for elbowing that girl. I like her. I like her! - We got an article by R.C. St. John. - Never heard of him. R.C. St. John? R.C. St. John? That's that new reporter from the U-dub daily. Thomas, one of my boys, says she's the bomb! Yo, that's right, bone. The cutie I tried to talk to at the bar. Listen to this! "And on a beautiful touch pass from his brother Kenny... - See that? - "Antoine Tyler sealed one of the biggest upsets... - "in college basketball. - Thank you. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. "While Antoine is the engine... that runs this team, - She can write, man. It is his younger brother Kenny who leaves his mark on virtually every play." Whoo! I was all open. You're all cockeyed. I'm Antoine Tyler. Show the teeth! Okay, again and again. I'm cross-eyed. That's why I wear the glasses. You want me to beat you up in front of everybody? - Why you gotta go there? - 'Cause I can, crybaby. That's why. Okay, ladies, come on. Let's move it out. We got the vans waiting. We got a big game to get to. Oh, yeah. I feel good tonight. Boy, it's gonna be a good one. - Puttin' on a show tonight, kid. - I got front-row seats. - You better be there. - Aw, come on now. You know better, son. And that's 15 for UCLA's Seward. But the Huskies still hold on by a narrow margin as we near the five-minute mark. - Rebound! - This seems to be the year... for the Huskies as they topple one powerhouse after another... en route to their first berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1984. O'Grady will bring it up. Lee guarding him as they cross mid court. O'Grady on the dribble. Goes low post to Hrbacek. Hrbacek back out to O'Grady. Behind the back dribble. He's gonna feed Kenny Tyler on the cutter. back to Antoine from 15. Buried it! Thirty-six for Antoine! Fifteen assists for brother Kenny... as they continue their quest for N.C.A.A. magic. And the Huskies lead by two. As we close in on four minutes, Lee will bring it up guarded by O'Grady. Lee over to Rhem, guarded by Antoine Tyler. Gonna try to drive the lane. Goes up and rejected by Kenny Tyler. They're gonna call a foul. That's number three on Kenny. That seemed clean to me. Next time, run the fist out. Bring it hard across the middle. - A & K, baby. - All the way, baby. - If you ain't open, who you gonna pass it to? - Who else? Just makin' sure you remember. Don't forget. I can't. You keep pounding it in my head. Rhem at the line is 67 % foul shooter. He's been cold tonight. Just four points on the evening. - That hit nothing but the bottom of the net. - Rebound! He'll have another to try to bring the Bruins even. Zigi, rebound! Rhem to try to tie things up. Off the mark. Young, the rebound, trying to pass. Out to Lee. Picked off by O'Grady. O'Grady to open Tyler. He starts a fast break. He has brother Antoine breaking for the basket. Kenny Tyler on the dish to brother Antoine... as they've done so many times before. - Antoine for a monster jam! - Yeah! - wow! - Yeah, baby! - Here's a future N.B.A. all-star in the making. Yeah, baby! Ant? - All right, back off, please. Back off. - Watch it, Lee. Ant? - Ant, what happened, man? - Will you step back? - I want to check him. Please, stand back. - Antoine? - You all right? - It's okay, Kenny. Get the paramedics. Get him on the stretcher. Ant, I'm gonna come with you. No, you stay. We still got the lead. Finish these bums off. Step back, please. Let's give him room. Let's go. - You all right, man? You okay? - I'm okay. Give us some room, please. Down! - Nichols, go along with him, okay? - Okay. I'll go with him. - It's okay. - One, two. - I'm right here. - You all right? - I'm all right. I'll be back. - Ant? - I'll be back. - Respiration is 35 and shallow. Pulse-- - He'll be back. Asthmatic? Medications? Histories? No history. I'll be back. You'll be okay, Antoine. Come on! Move! - He's gonna be all right, okay? - All right. Out of the way! Out of the way! Comin' through. - Move it. Move it. - Let's move it. You're doin' good, Antoine. - I can't find a pulse! - What? One, two, three, four, five. Get back! You're gonna be all right, Antoine. - Step back. - What are you doin'? Clear. - Come on. Come on! - Clear! I can't believe we lost this game. We sucked. Pathetic. Let's get the hell outta here. Damn! - Kenny? - Hey, Coach. I'm about to visit Antoine in the hospital. I gotta get his stuff. - Kenny. - What, Coach? We lost him, Kenny. What, Coach? For the season? I told that boy to stop dunkin' like he was Jordan. - What happened? He dislocated his shoulder? - Kenny. What, Coach? Antoine died on the way to the University Hosp-- Hospital. What? It-- It was his heart. They-- They don't know why. I mean, it just-- Coach, he just said he was comin' right back. They tried everything, Kenny, but they-- It happened so fast that they-- No. Bullshit. Bullshit. Kenny, wait. Kenny. - Kenny, hold on. - Move. I gotta go. - Get off of me! - Please. Hold on a second, all right? Get off, man! Get off me, man! - Hold up! Calm down, babe. We'll get through this together. I'm so sorry, Kenny. I'm so sorry.

Major scoops it out. Tyler to take a three. Oh, another brick. Damn! That's another disappointing shocker as the Huskies just cannot win... without their big star. Kenny, Kenny. Just a few questions.

No interviews. Kenny, I'm not here to interview you. - I'm tired of talking to reporters. - I'm not a reporter. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I mean, not right this minute. What? I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about what happened to your brother. - I can't imagine. - Thank you. But I'm fine. Really. To be honest with you, I'm really tired of all this sympathy. So this was a bad idea. Okay, I got it. I'll just leave. Forget it. Well, wait, wait. I say, wait! It's not you. I'm just not used to all this attention. I got all these people callin' me, askin' me questions. ESPN, Time magazine. Stickin' all these cameras in my face. All this 'cause my brother dies? I know. It's been awful. - Umbrella? - Thank you. - If you just want to talk, you know? - Thank you very much. - If you need someone-- - I ain't gonna thank you again. I'm jokin'. - Come on. - Put it in, Zigi! Watch the back pick. Kenny, set the offense. Come on, you guys. Kenny, come on. Luther, move it! What is that? What is that? - Come on, Kenny! - Damn! I am! - Baseline! Baseline! - Let's go. Run the double fist. Luther, I can't run that play if you can't get open! Move it, Luther! Move it! Hold it. Hold it. Stop. Stop. Give me the ball. - Here you go, Coach. - Luther... my wife's got a plastic Jesus on her dashboard moves better than you do! - Luther! - Listen, boys. We don't win this next game, it's sayonara. It's no N.C.A.A. It's no nothin'. What do ya say, Coach? I say we go out there and win. All right. Feed on that enthusiasm. Set the offense. Offense, come on. Let's go. Give 'em the ball. - Come on. - All right. Here we go. Go, Dawgs. Number one. Come on. Let's go. Kenny, Kenny! Big man for the three! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it a second! Zigi, what the hell are you thinking? - Well-- - You never shoot the three! Hear me? You never shoot the three! Everybody, I-- Hit the showers. All right. Go hit the showers. I think that three-point line in America much longer than in Serbia. Shut up, you seven-foot Tweety Bird. Shit, man! Damn! What? Huh? Coach? Hey, Coach? Coach! The ball! It's gone! It disappeared! Hmph. Hmm. Hmm. How ya doin'? How are you doin'? - I'm fine. I'm chillin'. - Chillin'? Really? - Yeah. - 'Cause I'm worried about ya. Coach, I'm a big boy. You ain't got to worry about me. Well, I do. You've been hit pretty hard lately. I don't want to add to your problems. But Coach Nichols thinks I should start Jimmy at the point tomorrow. Normally I'd ignore him, but it's the first original idea he's had in five seasons... so I'm trying it on for size. What do you think? - You're the coach, right? - Yes, I am. Yeah, but Jimmy can't set the pick. He can't go to his left. He couldn't carry this team with a forklift. Kenny, you're my guy now. But I gotta know you're ready to step up to the plate. Yesterday was the worst practice I've seen from this or any other team I've coached. And you didn't say a word. Now, why is that? - Coach, I'm not Antoine, man. - I know who I'm talking to. I need you to take charge of this team. I need a general. - That's not my game. - I'm asking you to make it your game! - But if it's not my game-- - I'm-- Kenny, you know it was four years ago today... that your brother signed a letter of intent to play basketball at U-Dub. I remember that day. I opened a ten-year-old bottle of Scotch. - I went home for lunch. Took a run at the wife. - Hey. - I don't want to hear-- - Kenny, that was a great day. The next year we signed you, and I knew I had a team... that could take Washington to the Final Four for the first time since '63. And I'm not willing to say good-bye to that dream, Kenny. Are you? I gotta go, Coach. I got a 2:00. Hey, Kenny. You don't have to play without your brother, you know? You got 'im. Right here. At the start of the second half, the Cal Bears lead the hapless Huskies 43-31. But the big story tonight, the continuing poor play of Kenny Tyler... with no points on no attempts. Hey, health food. All right! Mikulski, you're not eating? No, I can't eat anymore when I watch these guys. They make me sick. I feel like I'm wasting away. Okay, guys. We're down 12, but we don't stink. That's an improvement, all right? Move 'em around on offense. Move the basketball, okay? - Come on. Dawgs up here. - Hands in. - One, two, three! - Go. - Hey, Kenny. Kenny. - Yeah? - You okay? - Yeah. Why? - If you get open, take the damn shot. - All right. - Okay? - Yeah. And if you're not open, who ya gonna pass it to? - Hey! - Lowell's 10-foot fadeaway, and that'll drop off the rim. Tyler comes up with the rebound. He'll bring it up. Let's see if Tyler will finally take a shot... - this time downcourt. - Let's go! - Tyler stops, calls the play. - Get open! Anything can happen. Tyler turns, and he's gonna pass. Nice pass. Outside the three-point arc to O'Grady. O'Grady for three! And the Huskies... - Good pass! - light up with Tyler taking the lead. What the hell? Cal's Horning now will bring it back. Tyler tries to run him down. He'll dish it off to Byron. Byron, easy ten footer. Got it. Nope! He didn't. It's in and out. What a heartbreak. Tyler with a rebound over to O'Grady. What kind of shot was that? O'Grady across the time line. He puts the move on Faby. Serves up the no-look pass, and Major with a slam! And it's Dawgs up! Well, well, well! The Huskies are back. They're on fire. That's five unanswered points by the Huskies. They're back in. Okay, fill me in, Bernie. Eight seconds left in the game. Huskies, 72. Bears, 73. Bears up by one. That makes the Huskies down by one. - Okay. - They inbound the ball. Cal inbounds the ball. Over to Jackson. Eight seconds and counting. The Huskies need a turnover, or they can kiss the postseason good-bye. Jackson on the pass. Over to Stevens. Stevens, top of the key... - with five, four-- - Open! Open! And whoa! Hello! All the way, baby. That ball came out like a greased pig. Kenny! Kenny! - On the move now. Ahead to Tyler. - Malik! A chest pass for major. And that ball loops up to the basket, and it goes in! Nice shot! See that? I'm tellin' ya, Dawgs up, baby! 75-73! the Huskies win! Kenny Tyler with a knuckleball three pointer from half-court! This is one for the highlight reels. This is one to remember! Are you kidding? Here comes a bonus now. Kenny Tyler, folks. Kenny Tyler. Wow! Kenny, 18 points, nine assists and a wild and wacky second half. Oh, the easy two would have sealed the game, but you went for the three. Were you trying to send the basketball world a message? - Be honest. - Well, not really. I was dribbling downcourt, and I saw malik cut-- cut to the hair-- I mean, to the hole. - Kenny? - Well-- - Kenny? - Huh? - I'll be at the Barking Dog. - Yeah. You see me elbow that guy? You gonna see us at the Barking Dog, right? Nice game, baby brother. Hello? Hey, Kenny! I'm right here with you. Do ya hear me? Hello? Come on, y'all. Stop playin'. Anybody there? - I've been in your ear 20 years. - Hey, stop playin', y'all. And you don't know my voice. That's cold, man. Oh, I don't hear anything. I might be havin' a nervous breakdown, but I'm gonna be all right. I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna get me some sleep. I'm gonna be right back on top in the mornin'. I see you're gonna need a little bit more convincin'. Buggin', man. I'm buggin'. Come on. Now, relax and get your shit together, Kenny! Get your shit together. Okay. This is all a dream. It's all-- I got you! I got you! Kenny? Kenny, it's me. - Back up, boy. - Kenny? Back up. I will smoke you. Back up before-- - Kenny. Kenny, it's me. - Keep away from me. I told you to back off me! Oh, God. Would you wake up? Come here. - Come here. - Get off of me! - Get off of me! - Listen to me. It's just like Pop said. If you and I stick together, anything-- Anything. Anything. Can happen. Lock 'em up. Ant? Antoine? It's you? - Yes, it's really me! - Oh! Boy, come on. Come on. I told ya I was comin' back. I told ya I was comin' back. - Man. Man. - I can't believe it, man. You better believe it. Oh. Oh. It's a little too freaky. I'm-- I'm gonna take a seat. I'm just gonna get me a seat. Whoo. Oh, wow. This is amazing, kid! I don't believe it, man. - Wait till I tell mom. She's gonna be so happy. - Kenny. - And Halloween's gonna be the bomb this year. - That's not the way it works. You are the only one that can see me. - Why? - Because you called me. - You said you needed me. - This is gonna take a lot of gettin' used to. Well, get used to it fast, baby. We got a trophy to get, all right? - A & K-- - All the way. - N.C.-- - Two "A," baby! Yeah, man. - I missed you. - I missed you too, man. It's good to have my little brother back. It's good to have my big brother back. Oh, man, my man, Antoine. Aw, kid, it is so good to see you. Tell me something I don't know, Bernie. Well, folks, as the Huskies take the floor today... - they face Washington State in a must-win situation... - Right. To clinch their place in the Pac-10 and a wild card berth in the N.C.A.A. tourney. Tonight is huge. It's big. It's humongous. It's Marlon Brando. It's not gonna be easy. When the Cougars come to the Dawg House... - they come to play. - And who doesn't, Ernie? Unless, of course, the Huskies have Lady Luck on their side... it's liable to be the end of another long, disappointing season. - A long, long disappointing season. - It sure is. - Here we go. - Let's huddle. All right, let's go. Okay, okay, guys. Here we go. Now, remember, we just got to play our game, okay? Don't let them dictate the tempo. All we got to do is put the biscuit in the basket... the noodles in the soup, the cookies in the milk, the beef in the-- You said you wanted me to be a little more verbal, Coach. - Hmm, hmm. - When we get a lead, we're gonna go into a press. - Kenny. - All right? If we win this one, we go to the tournament. Nervous, kid? - Hell, no. - Got a problem with running the press? Oh, no, Coach. I was just talk-- Kenny, look at this. Malik, look for Preston to go hard inside. Kenny, look. I'm all thumbs. We're gonna win this with defense and rebounding, okay? Now, I want-- We're gonna win this with defense and rebounds. - Stop it. - I want you to watch out for-- - Watch this. - Keep Preston off the board. - Stop it. Hey, cutie pie. Danny, stay tight up on Wolf, okay? Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Oh, shit. Huh? Kenny, what are ya doin'? I got somethin' in my throat, Coach. Excuse me. Keep Preston off the boards. - Water. - Are we ready? - Come on. Go, Dawgs. - Way to go, Huskies! - Mm-hmm. - Oink! - Oh, I am so sorry. - Somebody get him a towel. Oh, I-- Thank you. I feel so much better now. I'm all right. - There you go. - Right. Somebody get him a towel. That was funny. - What are you doin'? - What's the matter with you? Start of the second half. The Washington Cougars, 37. U-Dub Huskies, 34. - That would be a three-point deferential. - That's what it is. LaSalle with the rebound. And over to Tyler. Tyler will bring it up. Hit Lik! Tyler shoots it ahead to Major on the wing. Guarded by Preston. He's gonna work the baseline. He's forced out-of-bounds. No! He's back inbounds. And a slam! Wow! Somebody check his feet for jet packs. Peter Pan's in the house, and he's goin' home for Christmas. - There he goes, and he's up. - Oh, yowza! Oh, did you see him fly? I'm telling you, the video camera does not lie. - That was a Clyde Drexler. - It was Dr. J. - Where you goin'? - Michael Jordan in the making. Major all over Preston. Preston rolls inside. Hrbacek steps up to try to take the charge. Whoa! A train wreck. That's a foul. That's a-- Wait a minute. No. - A charge is called. - What? Hello, Hrbacek. The Serb takes the charge... and comes up standin' like a seven-foot statue. - Preston for the three. Looks good. - Let's see what you got. Nope, it's out. Try to tip it in. Nope. Not again. Looks like a popcorn popper up there. Must be too much English on that ball. I think it's got French, Spanish and Swahili on it. 15 seconds left in the game. - The Huskies are up by one. - Washington has the ball. Huskies have to keep the Cougars from scoring. Tyler on Davidson now as he brings it up. Kenny, I'm over here. Listen to me. Don't blow it. That boy gonna go left. Davidson fakes left, goes right, leaves Tyler faked. He drives in for an easy slam. I thought you said he was goin' left! Well-- Well, he went to our left. And Coach Pederson's gonna call a time-out to regroup. - I thought you said he was goin' left. - He mostly does. What you mean, "mostly"? I'm a ghost, not a psychic. Aw, shut up. Hey, hey! You better watch it! - Stop that. - I'm gonna call Ghostbusters on your ass. You better call somebody. - What is Kenny-- - Hmm? I-- Seven seconds to go. The Huskies' ball... as Coach Pederson draws up the play. Take the ball out. Zigi, set the screen. Go! Go! - Go! - Whoo! Tyler will step up to make the inbound pass. Just throw it in. I'm gonna do all the rest, all right? - Alley-oop at the basket. - Tyler with an inbound to a breaking O'Grady. Oop. Quick pass to LaSalle. - I got it. I got it. - And LaSalle behind the back snow cone. Now-- Oh, my. A one-hand touch pass to Hrbacek. Oop. Between the legs of Preston! Major steps up, lofts one over his shoulder. Kenny Tyler for the alley-oop. It's gonna be close! Tyler-- And he slams it home as the clock runs out. What a win! The Huskies pull another heart stopper. 71 to 70! Huskies win! - What a game! - Where we goin'? Where we goin'? - To the big dance! - We're goin' to the big show. The big show in the sky! Thank you! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Beautiful! ♪ Nice game, boys Nice game ♪ - Kenny, not your game, huh? - Hey. - Great finish. - You the man, Coach. You the man, baby. Yeah! English! Whoo!

Now you done pissed him off. Huh? Antoine! I you must believe 7 - Look at that! Oh, my God! ♪ You must believe ♪ Ooh! - Hey, geez! - I don't believe it. - I don't believe it. - You better believe it, baby. Nice touch, baby. Uh, welcome back. Welcome to the San Francisco Bay area... and the sights and sounds of the N.C.A.A. West Regional. From the Oakland Memorial Coliseum, it's the University of Washington Huskies... - Go, Huskies! Come on! - against the Bulldogs of Fresno State. First, though, we got a chance to watch Harry the Husky... - Oh, yeah! Slamma Jammal! - as he'll perform his patented "Slamma Jamma Dunk." Looks like he's carryin' a load. - And the stat sheet says he is 0 for 15 on the season so far. - Whoo! Beautiful, gang. Come on. Here we go. One... - two and... - And Harry is all set. - Three! And three! - He's up! - Ooh, I hope that Dawg was wearing a cup. - Yes, definitely. Slight miscalculation. - And the final field of 64. Dick Vitale, any thoughts? - Go, Dawgs! Yea, Huskies! It's unbelievable! There's nothing like the N.C.A.A. tournament! It's the most special, unbelievable event! I mean, the pageantry, the excitement! I think it'll be awesome, baby! It wasn't too awesome for the Huskies in the regular season match-up with Fresno State. Well, coaches Pederson and Tarkanian are really ready. But Tarkanian put the hurt on 'em big time during the regular season. Blew 'em out by 20 points. It was an M & M-er, a mismatch. They're loaded. They could shoot the trifecta. They got Diaper Dandies. They got Prime Time Players. They're awesome! But you know what? Pederson better have his club ready... or it'll be Embarrassin' City, baby! - So you really like musicals a lot, huh? - Oh, you know... when the showboat appeared, it was magical. - Hey, St. John, how ya doin'? - Great. I see you got all dressed up for the tournament. Do you like that? I like to look nice. Hey, Gertz, why don't you take a stroll? Get yourself a complimentary hot dog. - I'm gonna talk to our friend here, okay? - What for? I'm shy. What do you care? Just go do it. Today. While we're young. - So. - So. You and Kenny pretty close, huh? We've talked a few times. - But that doesn't mean that-- - No, no. No, hey. Relax, relax. I know you're both adults, and, uh... what you guys do during recess is no business of mine. Anyway, the thing is... there's something goin' on with this team, and I have a feeling that Kenny's got something to do with it. Hmph! What are you getting at, Mikulski? What I'm getting at is - a break. Now, if there's a story here, and you drop the dime... you know, it could be the cover of Sporting News. Hmm. What do I have to do? Whatever it takes to get the story. Grab yourself a cold one and hold onto the armrest... 'cause it's game time. The Huskies and the Bulldogs set to square off. Hrbacek will tip off against O'Neil of Fresno State. O'Neil, you'll recall, earlier in the regular season... involved in an altercation with Kenny Tyler... that resulted in Tyler's ejection. Up and controlled by Hrbacek over to Tyler. He'll bring it up, guarded by Seymour. Hey! Hey! Start it off right. - Get a life. Leave me alone. - Let's go to Zigi for a three-pointer. - Zigi can't shoot no three-pointer. - Just do what I say. - Zig! - Tyler the dish to Hrbacek. - Way outside the three-point line. - Zigi, shoot! He's 0 for 12 outside the arc this season. - Zigi, what the hell are you-- - Do it, Zigi. Zigi for three-- He got it! - I can't believe it! Zigi goes downtown! - Nice shot! This Serb is goin' long distance. Somebody call M.C.I. He deserves a discount. - You've been working with him, right? - I, uh-- - Good work, Coach. - Thanks. Peabody brings it up, closely guarded by O'Grady. Tark will call the play. Now it's Peabody over to Seymour. Seymour, O'Neil on a drive, and a slam over Zigi... and a foul. And now tempers flare. Malik, he's got to watch it. He'll get a "T." - Tyler now steps in to try to calm things down. - You got a problem? Yeah, because you're in my face, White Shadow. You better be careful, punk. Big brother ain't here to protect your ass no more. - What? Punk! - Come on, little girl. That's bullshit, Ref. I should head-butt you like Dennis Rodman. - All right. Easy. - O'Neil, known for his bad-boy ways... is a regular Dennis Rodman in the making... but tonight he's more like Dennis the Menace... - out there looking for trouble. - Pour it in, now. Hey. - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - You gonna shoot? He drops back like a quarterback and he rifles... a line drive off the backboard. Whoa! This ball is sailing, sailing into the rafters. Somebody call 911. This boy needs a doctor. Oh, yeah. That happens on this planet all the time. What the hell are you doin'? Get your head in the game. And O'Neil left to ponder whether he should have been... - trying out for the Punt, Pass and Kick competition. - It went up and-- Huskies by nine now, as we wind down here in the first half. Seymour brings it up, guarded by Major. And O'Neil pushes off on Tyler. Hey, that looks like a foul. - Seymour rushes to O'Neil on the wing. - Come on, Ref. Leave my brother alone! And get your thumb out of my eye! And O'Neil turns it over on purpose. This boy has flipped his lid. Somebody call Bellevue and see if there's a vacancy. Time out. Time out. So a major upset-- 76, 61. Dick, you and I have seen a lot of strange games. This one was wild. I can't believe it. I mean, I'm stunned. I know Tarkanian's gotta be shocked. Look at the stats, Brad! Thirty-six by Kenny Tyler. He was super! They wield some unbelievable canine magic today, the Huskies. Whoo! That's it, baby! - All right! - Gimme some! Yeah! That's the way we do it, boy! A & K all the way. It felt like old times. Let's celebrate, get some grub. Or better yet, let's go to the cemetery. See if I can get laid. I need some action. That sounds great, but, uh... I think I'm gonna be busy tonight, bro. Oh, come on, Kenny, man. Would you stop-- Yeah! Aaahh! ♪ Baby ♪ Yeah! Oh, no, I couldn't. I couldn't. Oh, all right. Nichols, get in here! Whoo! Wow! Whoo! Whoo! We're goin' to the tournament! One time, right, my mom was bein' thrifty... and she went to K-Mart... - and bought us these cheap-ass shoes. - Stop. - Yo, I swear. - I couldn't tell the left from the right. They were like some ambidextrous shoes. It was hilarious. Oh, man. Oh, God. Antoine. That's my man. - So. - So. - We were talking about the game. - Right. Have you been doing anything special? Wearing your lucky socks? Carrying a rabbit's foot? Taking anything? What do you mean, "taking anything"? I've just never... Seen a team play like this before. It's-- So we gotta be on something? No. I didn't mean for it to pop out like that. - Oh! - There it is. That's the headline. "Huskies Shootin' up. Dawgs On Dope." - Shut up. - You're the only one that can hear me, so hear me. - Kenny? Kenny! - Move. Move! So what are you tryin' to say? - I'm just, uh-- - I'm just, uh, uh, uh-- She's babbling. Ba-a-a-a. She's stuttering. Why are we-we talking like this? - She ain't givin' you no ass. - No reason. - Stop that corny smile. - It's just that you look so... Don't get corny. - Stop that! - beautiful from this angle. - You ain't got to work that hard. - And this angle. - You ain't gettin' no ass. - Would you excuse me? - I've gotta go to the bathroom. - No rhythm. Look. We've been through a lot together... and I love you more than anything in this world... - but you've gotta stop poppin' up all the time... - Kenny. - Kenny. - wantin' to play. I'm on a date. I can't play with you right now. Gosh! Why are you making this so hard? People are starting to stare at me. - You know something? - Hey! I have the same problem. Trust me. My problem's a lot bigger than yours. Oh. Oh, no, wait. My man! I'm not talking-- Not that kind of problem! - You hurt him. - That's not funny. That man thinks I'm talking to my piece. You was having a conversation with your piece. Little conversation piece. Ha, ha! Conversation-- When I'm locked up in Bellevue, I'm blamin' you, okay? Ah! Great. The food is here. I am starving. Look, Kenny, I didn't mean to accuse you of anything. Girl, stop it. We cool. Don't worry about it. - You have to admit, there's been a lot of weird-- - Weird? Nah. I didn't notice anything weird happening. You're trippin'. Whoa! It's not just for steak anymore. Steak sauce. Mmm. Steak sauce. Oh. - Yes. Yeah. - Mm, mm, mm. I love me some steak sauce. On salmon?

What a story this has become for the U.W. Huskies. Their little guy, Danny O'Grady, elevates his game to a new level. So does his team as Coach Pederson's squad... upsets Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels... sends the Heels back to Chapel Hill, and for the Huskies now it's on to the Sweet Sixteen. O'Grady brings it up, into the front court. The dish, Zigi on the drive. And the lay-in. Hrbacek's got 15. - Owl! - Ow! Ow! - Ow! Ow! - Owl - Unbelievable! A street brawl took place. The Arkansas Razorbacks cut themselves to shreds. Three of their five starters were ejected for fighting with themselves! How wacky can ya get? And their coach, Nolan Richardson, was sent to the showers... allowing the U.W. Huskies to march on to the Great Eight. Husky hysteria is goin' wild! So the clock stopped. 3:20 remaining in the ball game. 70, 63, the Huskies, Dick, and they're clinging... - {0 that seven-point advantage. - Pitino gets a 1.0. It's Maalox-mashing time for both coaches. Pitino's talkin' to his team. "We gotta speed up the tempo of the game.” Pederson says, "We gotta spread out and slow it down." Danny and Kenny, you keep that ball on the perimeter. And guys, use the clock. Use that clock. All right? Come on. Let's go! Here we go! - One, two, three. - Woof! Woof! Woof! Huskies' ball as they break the huddle. Let's look for Major to be the trigger man on the inbound. Kirk will step up and force the press. Wildcats in desperate need of a turnover. Major in to O'Grady. And the little guy will bring it up for the Dawgs... and Marlowe covers him stride for stride on the way up court. Four corners! Work the clock, guys! Work it! Work it! O'Grady taking his time, working that clock... now cross-courts it to Tyler. - Throw an alley-oop to Luther. - Coach said milk the clock. Coach, my ass! Just do what I said! I'm running this team! - Look for Tyler to try to run... - Luther! - A four-corner, slowdown offense. - I got it! I got it! He tossed an alley-oop to LaSalle. A slam]! But LaSalle steamrolls Kirk in the process... and that is a foul. Charging call on LaSalle, Dick, and that's number five. Wow! He's their big star, goes to the sideline on a charge! Looks like they're gonna have to go... - with Jimmy Stubbs. - Who? Jimmy who? Come on. Move it! Move it! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go. Let's go. Damn it, Luther. You call that using the clock? - No, Coach, but-- - Four fouls. You get called for a charge? Sit down! - Coach! - Sit down. - Jimmy! - Huh? - You're going in. - Who, me? Thank you very much. You will not be disappointed. Always looking out for a brother. Let's hear a new yell! - Lu, man, I want to say I'm sorry-- - Get off me! And tell your damn brother to get off me too. Whoo! Did you see that? Boy, did you see me? Did you see that? It was like old times. Did you see how high I was? - I ain't in the mood. Leave me alone. - What? You buggin', man. You goin' too far. I'm goin' to the Final Four, son. I don't know where you're goin'. Well, another Husky shocker. Can you believe it? 90, 71. A 19-point win over Kentucky. Excuse me. Kenny! Excuse me, baby. Don't eat the cake till I get back. Kenny? Where you at, Murphy? Whoo! Nice shot. Two. Hey! Hey, what's up, Ma? Whoo! I remember when you made that foul line. I bought the paint. You got sick of us drawing it with your lipstick. I, uh... caught myself trying to die a little with Antoine. - Oh, Mama. - But you wouldn't let me. I watch you out there... alive, and playing, and-- oh, God. It's almost like he's right there beside you. - Well-- - Honey... I don't know what's gonna happen in new york, and I don't care. I just want to say thank you, baby. I just wish your daddy was here. Oh! He would be so proud... - Of you. - Mama. Who's your big girl? You are. You better believe it. Let's go on inside. Uncle Jake's here to see you. Oh, no. Not Uncle Jake! That man ain't got no teeth, and he always wants something to eat. Look for Tyler now to run a four-corner offense. He looks inside-- Yeah. Never eat a pizza after a burrito. What do you want, Mikulski? - Did you talk to him? - Yeah, I talked to him. - What did you find out? - There's nothing to find out. - What do you mean-- - I gotta get back to this... so if you don't mind, just leave me-- Hello? R.C., are you there? - Did you hang up? - alone. Listen to me. LaSalle steamrolls Kirk in the process. - Luther, you didn't even-- - LaSalle, with a slam! - LaSalle steamrolls Kirk-- - You didn't touch the ball. It's 70, 63. Huskies now... and you have to wonder what LaSalle was thinking about. Have to wonder what LaSalle was thinking about. "Tell me what--" "Tell your damn brother to get off me"? - Yeah? - Hey, what's up, Kenny? What's up, Dawg? What's poppin'? Is it cool we... talk for a minute? Is it cool I come in? Yeah. Come on. I said "we," I meant the team. - Damn. - Is he here? - Is Antoine here? - Yeah. He's in the shower. Dead people usually don't take showers, Kenny. And how many dead people do you know, Zigi? - Not too many. - All right, then. What's up? What y'all want to talk about? - Tell him. Come on. - It-- It's Antoine. - Yeah? What about him? - We don't want to play with him anymore. I mean, it feels wrong. Just tell him to chill. Maybe come sit on the bench with me, or something. Personally, I'm averaging 18 points a game since he's come back... so I really don't give a shit, all right? Look, look, look, look, look. He's a ball hog. He was when he was alive, and no disrespect... He's even worse as a dead man. He didn't hear us, did he? - Hmm? - Huh? - I think it's him. - Me too. I've still got that embalming fluid in my ears. - I can't get-- - Hi, Antoine. What's this? Looks like some kind of lynch mob. - Go ahead. Tell him. - You tell him, Luther. You tell him. Tell me what? What are they talking about, Kenny? I ain't tellin' him. You tell him, Jimmy. It was your idea. You're lying through the space in your teeth. Now say something. Talk to me, Kenny. They want you off the team, man. Off the team? Me-- You want me off the team? Let me tell you something! You don't tell me shit! You don't tell me shit! - None of you! - Antoine, chill! - Shut up! - Uh-oh. I think we pissed him off. - Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's-- Look, it's nothin' personal. - Nothin' personal? - Don't throw that chair! Nothin' personal? Nothin' personal? I raised all your games to another level! Me! I did that! You on TV. You gettin' scouted. Zigi, you might go lottery. I got that for you. And this is the thanks I get? You make me sick. Antoine, if they don't want you to use them, use me. I can see it now. Twenty-two assists... 34 points and 10 boards. Together we can win tournament M.V.P. Sounds good. - Man, shut up, Malik. - I'm trying to go pro. Kenny, I never wanted to die. I had things I wanted to do. I had plans. I know, man. If you want me to go, you just tell me... and I'm gone. Jimmy, this is my brother and, uh... if he wants to stay, then he stays. We're gonna play some ball tonight! Let's go, Huskies! Hey! Where you been? I've been looking for you. You wasn't at the banquet last night... or at the conference this morning. - Where you at? - Sorry. I've been busy. - Oh. Been writin'? - Yes! Writing. Look, I have to go. No, wait, R.C. I-I-- I gotta talk to you. It's really important. It's kind of difficult for me to say. - You don't have to-- - No. I-I need to. Sometimes things happen that are bigger than us. Things that we really can't explain. Things that make absolutely no rational sense. Kenny, you don't-- Really-- I know this sounds crazy, believe me, but-- It's about Antoine. - He's here. - Come on, Kenny. Team meeting. Let's go. - Sweetie, you gotta believe me, okay? - Kenny, come on. Okay. Coming, Coach. Hmm. It's a great hotel. It's got hot water between 7:00, 7:30. There she is. You looking for me? Yes. I wrote this piece that-- R.C., this is David Gallagher, Sporting News. - Ron Hammer, the Boston Globe. - Hi. It's nice meeting you gentlemen. I wanted to talk to you-- Gentlemen, keep an eye on this girl. She has the drive. You know, I think she'd sell her own mother for a good story. So, what do you got for me? - You ready to win that Pulitzer? - Not just yet, anyway. Uh, got a little bit more work to do on it. It was nice meeting you gentlemen. Wait, wait. Where you goin'? Come on. Come on! Aw, I don't know. Must be my personality. There goes the story of the year. Welcome to the Meadowlands... home of the N.C.A.A. Championship; home of college basketball's highest honor. And home of all the pageantry and excitement that is the Final Four. We kick off the festivities with U-Dub's Harry the Husky. And Harry's gonna get set for his patented slam dunk. And I say "get set" because the stat sheet doesn't look good: 0 for 16 on the season for Harry. So, folks, this could get a little bit ugly. Harry's ready, though. - I'm goin' downtown! - And he calls his shot... - a la Babe Ruth. - Here we go! - Whoa! - Damn Dawg! Ahhh! - Whoa! - Oh, he got it! Ya-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Did you guys see that? Thank you. Thank you. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! It's gonna be a long night for the Huskies unless they can find someone... to put those defensive handcuffs on Georgetown's Jerrod Smith. George, when you got a six-foot, five-inch point guard... that can go in the paint and shoot the three... it's an impossible match-up on the college level. I don't think the Huskies have another upset in them tonight. - Kenny Tyler. - The infamous Jerrod Smith. What's up, baby? - How you feelin', man? - I'm good, man. I'm really good. Hey, man, I'm really sorry to hear about your brother. - Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate that. - Wish he was here. Yeah. Me too. Hey, well, man, you get over there and tell your team about me. Come on, man. Better tell your team about me. All right. You better look up. We're gonna get that air. Smith brings it up, over to Douglas... - Pass! Pass! - back over to Smith. - Get on him! - Now Smith on the drive. A 15-footer. Got it! And that's 22 for Smith, here in the first half alone. - A one-man wrecking crew. - Don't let Smith do that! That's 40, 32, Hoyas, as they roll on, led by Jerrod Smith. Come on, you guys. Double-team Smith! Double-team Smith! - Jerrod moves inside, covered by Tyler. - Get the ball. - Major now steps up to try to help. - Get the ball! - Oh, he's got the lane. - Help out, Malik. - Smith for two more. Thirty-two tonight. - Damn! What are y'all doin'? O'Grady will try to guard him. Nobody else has been able to. Tyler, in a double-team. Jerrod passes inside. Gruca, the no-look to Burgos on the baseline. Easy deuce. They call a double-team on Jerrod, and he hurts them in other ways. - Jerrod on the dribble. - Play good, solid "D." Watch him, Kenny. He's going left! Slam, bam, thank you, ma'am. - This guy is amazing! - You want me to handle it? You want me to do it my way? 'Cause I'll take care of him. He ain't shit! Sh-- Man! O'Grady now, across the time line. He runs into a Hoyas double-team. Pass over to Tyler. Not a good one! Intercepted by Smith! Smith on the right! - Smith is down, and he's injured. - What you doin', man? Coach Thompson and the trainers are called in. And man, you hate to see this kind of injury in a game of this magnitude. - My shoulder, Coach. - Jerrod, what's wrong? - My shoulder. - Just be careful. Take your time. Stay there. Stay there. And the heavily favored Hoyas lose to U-Dub, 78-65. And now, the Huskies move on to the big show. - Kenny. - Hey! What's up, R.C.? How ya doin'? How is he? I don't know. He's been in surgery for over an hour. I know he got a broken collarbone. Concussion too. Yeah. I hope he's all right. God. Tsk. Kenny, it's your brother, isn't it? Yeah. - So tell him to stop. - It's no use, R.C. He ain't gonna listen to me. He never listens to me. He's the older brother. He calls the shots. Kenny, look at yourself. Antoine is dead, and he's still running your life. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know us. You don't know what it's like trying to live my life without my brother. Stupid-- No, I don't know what it's like. And neither will you until you let him go. Antoine! Yo, Antoine. Antoine. Antoine, I know you in here. Yeah, I'm here. You always did like being the first one in the locker room. That's only because I was always so nervous, kid. - You were? - Yeah, man. I'd come into the locker room, see all these jerseys hangin'... and I'd find the one with my name on it. I would just sit down, stare at it... wondering if I could go out there and lay some up one more time... and live up to the hype. Damn. I didn't know you were scared. Baby brother, I played scared every game of my life... wondering how I would do, what people would think. But I'll tell you something. I'm not scared no more. No, sir. This is one game I am going to enjoy. Yeah, well, uh... you're gonna have to enjoy it from the bench, Ant. What are you saying? Wait a minute, Kenny. If this is about Jerrod Smith, that was an accident. - Ant. Ant. Ant! - I'm your brother. You know me better than that! - I didn't mean to hurt him. - Antoine, look. You got us here. No doubt about it, man. Without you, we'd be watching this on TV. Exactly. Kid, this is cheating. It's wrong. I'm sorry, Ant. You can't play, man. Oh, please. I'm playin', Kenny. You're gonna be playing alone. Kenny, think about it. N.C.A.A. title. One more game. It's what we always dreamed about, me and you. Since we was kids we've been partners. Antoine, we ain't never been partners, man. I've been your sidekick for over 20 years, kid. And I was happy to be that, but I can't do it no more. I just can't do it. Now, if you step on that court tonight, it's over. What are you gonna do? How are you gonna stop me, huh? We'll walk. We'll just forfeit. You will lose without me. Then we'll just lose. ♪ O'er the land ♪ ♪ Of the free ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ And the home ♪ ♪ Of the ♪ ♪ Brave ♪♪ Welcome to the N.C.A.A. National Championship. Come on. Get in here, guys. Listen up, now. Listen up. Come on, come on. You know, when I was a kid... I played in the biggest basketball game of my life. It was the Wilmington, Delaware, Youth League Championship... and the winning prize was a shiny gold medal. Well, you know, we should have won that game... but we didn't, and I always felt... that if I had played just a little bit better... you know, if I had really played my guts out... that we would have won, and I would have won that medal. Well, now, this is the-- This is the biggest game of your lives... and it's just you guys, two orange hoops... 94 feet of hardwood. So go out there and play the very best that you can... and really play your guts out. And believe me, you will have no regrets... and you will win your medal. Just go out there and play the game that you love. - Come on! - Let's go, let's go! Woof! Woof! Woof! And the Huskies take the floor, led by Kenny Tyler... who's assumed leadership of this team following the tragic loss... of his brother Antoine earlier this year. But the U-Mass Minutemen, they're the perennial favorites. They come into the tournament the number-one seed... and with the number-one ranking in all of college basketball. Don't want to look for any upsets here. Three future N.B.A. stars on this club: six-five point guard Rudy Olivera, six-nine power forward J.J. Sampson... and six-ten forward Mark Tucker. I don't even think Lady Luck can help the Huskies tonight. Hrbacek and Sampson to jump center. And it's controlled by U-Mass, over to Olivera. Push the ball, Olivera! Push the ball! Sampson, down low. Now the no-look. Moore in the paint. A finger roll, and the early lead goes to U-Mass. Slow it down! Give me two! Give me two! - Tyler to O'Grady. - Hustle up, Danny! Dish back to Tyler. Tyler with a look and a shot, way off the mark. For the Minutemen. Cross-courts it to Sampson, out to Olivera. Breakaway, easy deuce. And the Huskies are still having trouble getting started. We're midway through the half. U-Mass leads, 20 to 8. Back the other way. The dish outside. Moore, top of the key. Got it! Nothin' but the bottom of the net, and the Huskies are down 14. Yeah, baby! Major has a look and sets. He'll take the three, and he got it! The Husky fans cheer their underdog U-Dub squad for that three... but it's hardly enough to send the Minutemen packing. - Bounce pass down to the baseline to Moore. - Look alive! Look alive! To Tucker. Tucker tosses to Olivera. Got a pick. Backdoor lob and Sampson finishes that one off. U-Mass just too strong tonight for the Huskies... as they pull to a 14-point advantage... with five minutes to go in the half. Olivera proving his All-American status in this half... and he'll finish it with two more. Well, U-Mass leads 42 to 22 at halftime, Billy... and I guess the $64,000 question right now is... "Has that magic that brought the Huskies into the Final Four... finally abandoned them?" Oh, man, it's over! We suck without big "A," man. We suck! We are pathetic. - How many points we down, man? - Shit, we down 20 points! It feels worse than that. Let's be honest. We never expected them to get this far. It's kind of amazing where they are. Too much talent down the other end of the floor. They're being outclassed tonight. Fellas, fellas, the hole's been dug, man. They're just gonna bury us. Guys? We just can't do it without Antoine. We don't have to, Zigi. Man, what are you saying, Kenny? I'm saying I want to win this. I didn't come this far to go home empty-handed, Malik. Shut up, man. You don't know what you talkin' about. Malik, we are down 20 points, man. Twenty points! Do you know why? I know why. 'Cause we suck. Man, that's bull. We don't suck. They suck. - It's bullshit, man. We playin' with no soul. - Yeah, well, I know. We played that first half without Antoine. Face it. There's only one way we gonna get back in this game. What-- What you sayin'? I'm saying we go back out on that court, Jimmy. - And we take Antoine with us. - No. We already agreed-- Right here. Right here, Jimmy. Right here. Everything my brother was... everything he gave us... it's all right there. Right here. Right here. We gotta go out there, and we gotta-- We gotta shoot with him. We gotta run with him. We gotta play with him. We have to win with him, Malik. Y'all with me? - All right, man. Let's go! - We're with you, Kenny. Let's do this! Let's go all the way! Malik? Jimmy? Let's go! Let's do this! Let's go out there and win this game. Woof! Woof! Woof! And the Huskies have really hit the floor running... here at the start of the second half. - They're on a 10-0 run, and they are fired up. - Yeah, baby, right here! Kenny Tyler, top of the key for three! Kenny Tyler is lighting it up on both ends of the court now. O'Grady looks for someone, gets it to Tyler on the wing. Tyler drives to the paint. A 15-footer. It's good! Kenny Tyler's electrified this crowd. They're on their feet. Holy smokes, Billy. Kenny Tyler is on fire. - What an incredible performance by this young man. - It really is. You love to see big players come up in big games. That's what Kenny's doing. He's put this team on his back, and he's carrying them. Tyler fakes left, circles in, drives. Jump shot, up, and it is good! Tyler, bringing the Huskies back in this thing. - Danny, hit Lik! Hit Lik! - O'Grady, the lob. Major with a slam! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ball game. - Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! - Set up. We comin' back now. - It's Tyler with a ten-footer. - In, baby! Right here! Tyler, in for two. Major to O'Grady. O'Grady back to Tyler. Fakes left, goes right. Fade away. Jump! He got it! And the Huskies pull to within 11. - Right here! Right here! - O'Grady over to Hrbacek. Way out on the wings. Skyhook for three! - And Zigi hit it from downtown for the triple! - It's the real Serb. That's it, you American scum. That's it! Motion, baby, motion! Olivera makes the lay-in to hold the lead at five. Two minutes. Two minutes, and we down five, baby. Kenny Tyler cuts it down to three. Major, in to Tyler. Tyler fakes. A high archer, off the glass. Got it! And that double brings the Huskies to within two. And a time-out call by the Huskies. The Minutemen clinging to a two-point advantage... with just 16 seconds left on the clock. Okay, guys, 16 seconds left to a national championship. - We gotta keep Tyler from beating us. - Kenny, you make this shot. Let's take this one home. This is it. This is what we came here for. - Okay, Dawgs up, you guys. - Dawgs up! Dawgs up! Woof! Woof! Woof! U-Mass! And who would have thought the Huskies would be in this position? Sixteen seconds on the clock, a chance at being a giant-killer... of the number-one team in the country. The Huskies will line it up. The Minutemen will use that tight man-to-man defense. We have to assume that Pederson made the call to Tyler for the inbound game winner. Moore is over LaSalle. He doesn't want a five-second call. Finally with the inbound. It's stolen by Tucker. And that is it. If they can hold on to it, the championship is theirs. Nine seconds to go. All U-Mass has to do is to occupy this ball. The Huskies step up the "D," but time is running out. Somebody's got to force a turnover or a foul here, or this one's in the books. O'Grady on Tucker. We're down to seven seconds and counting. O'Grady on him like a pit bull, trying to make something happen. Five seconds left. Someone needs a play here! - No turnovers! - Tucker tries to pass to Oliver... and Kenny Tyler gets a hand on it! - Here comes Tyler again! Can you believe it! - Go! Go! Come on! Tyler again! He's got it! He goes up! I got it, dude! Ant, no! No, no! Let it go. It's good! Yes! - 66, 65! - Oh, my God! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Number one! Number one! All the way! - We did it, baby! - No, you did it. I gotta go see the coach. - I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. - Hey, R.C.! - Hey! Antoine. Wait! Antoine! Antoine! Antoine, wait! Ant-- Antoine. - We did it, baby. - No. You did it, like I never let you do it before. And you looked good doin' it too. I had a good teacher. Yeah. They're calling me. They want me to play on the team. Said I might make the starting five... if I learn not to hog the ball. I love you. - Come here, man. - I love you. It's okay. I love you. Bye, Antoine. No, no. No. No good-byes, 'cause I'll always be with you. Hey, it's like Pop said. If you and I stick together-- Anything can happen. You gonna be all right, man. But if you don't repeat next year... I'll be back. Here I come. Yeah! All right! All right! Yeah, baby! Huskies! Number one, baby! Yeah, Coach! Number one, baby! Huskies! Huskies, baby! Huskies! Yeah, baby! That's our sixth man, isn't it? Yeah, Coach. A & K... all the way, baby. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, baby! We did it, Coach!
