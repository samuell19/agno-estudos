Sham! - A great pianist. - Great! Sham! Sham! You suck. - Sir, please! - Terrible. Bad. Awful. Do you play with your boxing gloves on? THE BEAUTY AND THE MOODY Hello. Good day. It's not good. When I called the pizza place, I was told the delivery would take 30 minutes. How long has it been? 31 minutes. Yes. Please excuse me. The address was a bit hard to find. But this is your order. Pepperoni anchovy. Not pepperoni. I ordered salami. Salami. - No, look. The order says... - What's your name? Oh, besides being late, besides bringing the wrong order, you are aggressive? - Aggressive? But, sir, I... - Your name. Ha-Harold. Harold Cordoba. Alright, Mr. Cordoba. You're going to be in trouble with your bosses when they learn about your bad service. Have a good day. Sir. Can you read this? 30-minute delivery or free order. How long has it been? 31 minutes. Right now, 32. Yes. This is Cheo Martinez. A real nightmare to passengers who take his taxi. And to anyone who comes his way. Make other people's life bitter has become an everyday habit for this guy who seems to enjoy his role as unwanted. Cheo scares children off by talking about the dentist. Going to the dentist is awful! It will hurt. And it will hurt badly. Let's not go to the dentist! I'm scared! The girl is found dead. The kind of guy who tells the end of a movie at the cinema. Let's see, brainy people. Who is the killer? The cop's wife. The guy who speaks ill of the deceased person at a funeral. We all knew this tramp. He did everything he wanted. - Calm down. - He liked gambling, drinking, women... Oh. He was a ladies' man. Unbelievable. The guy who plays loud music at inadequate hours. All I want is to sleep. I had three serenades last night. I have to rehearse today with the orchestra, the vallenato band and the music group. All I want is to sleep! The guy who parks incorrectly at the entrance so that nobody can leave. And an endless list of so many other things. A real nightmare to his neighbors. Mr. Martinez! Mr. Martinez! Mr. Martinez! Please open up! I know you can hear me! Mr. Martinez! Your car is blocking the entrance and I have to go to work! - Please come out! - Oh, stop! Stop, stop! What should I do? Should I kill him? Okay. I will strangle him! Abundio, calm down! You'll have a heart attack! Let it be. That's what you want. You want me to die but I'll handle it first! Enough, dad. Calm down. Besides, it was you fault. One moment. What happened? My intelligent husband wrote this mean guy's name as a reference for a bank loan. When they called to confirm the information, that tramp said a lot of mean things about Abundio. You can't even imagine the terrible things he said. Don't you worry. - As I told you, I'm going to... - Alright! Wait a minute. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Abundio. I arrived first so I'll kill him first. - Okay. Kill him! - Wait. Please calm down a bit. - Calm down. - Calm down? Just look at the time. I should be picking up the first kid by now. I'm exhausted! I'm sorry, excuse me! But I'm exhausted! This isn't right! Wait a minute. I told you I arrived first so I'm the first who is going to tell him off. - Is it by turns? - We took turns, yes. - What's your turn number? - Open up! I'm telling you... No, if we work together, we'll do things well. Hush... he turned the music off so let's calm down, okay? It's not about that. Everyone, calm down! Good morning. You're very irresponsible, did you know that? - That's what you are. - Go ahead, tell him! - Miserable. - No. You're a son of a... Oh... don't be rude. Have a good day. Thank you. Baby... watch out. I told him. I put him in his place. Neighbors. This situation has hit bottom. Let me tell you something. If we don't make drastic decisions, this guy is going to drive all of us crazy. No, no, no. Listen. We'll make a list of all the bad things this guy has done to us since he came to live in this building. He parks his taxi wherever he wants. He plays music as loud as he wants, anytime he wants. He hangs his clothes by the window. His maintenance fee is late. Has he ever been in a neighbor meeting? Never. - No, no. - Ever. He did something to me. I was working on a catalog with some models in my apartment. A very nice cover. But he turned off the power at the main fuse box. He is just crazy. That guy is just crazy. Let me give you an example. Remember what he did when the Colombian team was playing that match? And that's nothing. This is what he did to me. I still remember. I swear I think of that and my estrogen goes down. Right. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Arms... Moving to the same side. Five, six, seven, eight. Keep going. I'm coming! That's it. Keep going! Five, six, seven, eight. I'm coming! Oh, boy. Very good. What's up? I came to remind you about the building's co-living manual. It is forbidden to play music at this volume, especially at this time. Nobody has said anything about your music... Now. This property is to be used for living purposes only. I seriously doubt you have a mayor's permit or a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce. And let's not even talk about taxes. Now. I think it is unbelievable... that you are deceiving these people. Yes. You and I know that four blocks away there is a wonderful dancing school with amazing instructors who charge half of what she charges. Have a good day. The school is at 7th street No. 23-08. Unbelievable. For months... I tried hard to get all of my students back. But I still have a bad reputation. - I heard some things. - Where? - At the bakers. - At the bakers? This guy has done something bad, something mean to all of us. And what about it? We have considered all possibilities and we can't get rid of him. I lost my job. It's because of that. Because we argue, because we fight. That's why he takes advantage. We need to stop looking for legal options. We just need to attack him. What? Finding out his weaknesses? - Yes. - I'm sorry. I don't think he has so many weaknesses that we can use to attack him. That's my point of view. I don't know. Mireya. Everyone has a weakness. Remember that. What do you mean by that, my dear friend? No, no, no. Mr. Abundio. Look. Let's calm down. Let me ask a question. Have you ever seen him with a girlfriend? He doesn't have a girlfriend. A friend who is a girl? A nephew? A lover? But what's wrong if he doesn't have a girlfriend? I don't understand. What's your point? That's how we can attack him. Let me tell you something. Big problems... require desperate solutions. - My dear friend. - Mmm? Is that girl a friend of yours? Yes, sirs. You're a tough guy! Let me see if I got it right. You want me to pretend I'm the cousin of someone who lives with you, make one of your neighbors fall in love, convince him to leave the building, and then disappear? That's it! - In short, that's what we need, Carito. - Got it. Let me ask you something. What do you think I am? No, no. Remember when you said, "I want to be an artist, I want to be an actress" and I made your book? Yes, of course. But that's one thing. And this... is a different thing. You're crazy. - No... - No, no. Look. It's the same. It's as if you were acting in a soap opera. You would be playing a role. And... there's some money. No. Really. Don't even try to explain. Because I'm going to be very honest. I am not willing to do something that twisted. Seriously. - Thank you so much. - No. Listen. Carito. Wait. Let's do something, okay? I'll give you my card. Think about it, reconsider it. Maybe you'll say, "Yes, I'll help you." Okay? - Thanks. - No. Thank you. Thank you. At least we tried. Let me tell you something. Nobody can know about this. This is a secret between the three of us. And the women in the building can't know. Gentlemen? That's right. And is she also a friend of yours? I'm good at telling jokes. I'm good. Excuse me. I'll be back soon. I saw her over there. Hello? Alcides. Hi. It's Carolina. Hi, Carito. What's up? I thought it through and... I'm going to accept your offer. What a good news! Yes. And... how much are you going to pay? - What? - Go ahead, please. No, no, no. Who does she think she is? That's a lot of money! Mmm... Let me explain, ladies. The thing is that Carito... is an actress. She's a soap opera actress. And they're used to good pays. So... if she accepts us, she won't by hired by anyone else. So... is she that good? - Really good. - Really good. - Oh, really? - A really good actress. No, no, no. A really good actress. A really good actress. Yes. We went to the theater yesterday. We saw a rehearsal. - Yes. - She is very talented. Is she very pretty? - Yes... - No, no, no. - No? - No. She's very gracious. She works at the theater. She has a very special grin. She's gracious. No. No, no, no. I agree with Linda. That's a ton of money. I can't afford that. Let's see. Let me explain, ladies. Let's weigh the situation. What's more important: tranquility... or money? Mm-hm. I agree entirely with my friend. That... Let's not think about it so much. Let's chip in and gather the money. Let's let the girl earn that money because she deserves it. Yes. I agree. Why so doubtful? Listen to that. This blog has always been known for telling the truth and we will continue to do so this time. Even if it bothers many people. We think that the patriotic scandal about the Colombian cyclists participating in Europe is exaggerated. Hi! Is Linda here? Linda? No way. I think... I knocked on the wrong door. Linda doesn't live here, right? It's on... upstairs. 401. Alright. Thanks! Unbelievable. I wonder. After Egan, how many times have we won the Tour de France? Hi! Remember me? Just kidding. I know you remember me because I just... Anyway. It's a joke. A bad one. The thing is that my cousin Linda is not home and I need to use a bathroom urgently. Could I use yours? Thanks! Oh, you're so kind. Unbelievable. Mom, why do you treat me like this? No, I think it's really unfair! That's exactly why I came to live in Bogota, to give you a better future. Mom, don't worry. I'm fine. At one of Linda's neighbors' home. Yes. A very kind man. Yes. A nice person, a gentleman. And even handsome. Well, he's not a cover model, but... there's something special about him. Alright. Mom, I just called to tell you that I arrived safely, that I'm fine, and that I'm meeting nice people. Okay. Okay, bye. Oh, thank you so much. Don't worry. Don't stand up. I know the way out. I'm kidding. It was a joke. A bad one. Like today. It's been a bad day. Alright. Anyway, I'll wait for cousin Linda in the hall. Thank you so much for letting me use the bathroom and nice to meet you. My name is Carolina. Are you free? Ready to run? I was kidding. It was a joke. A bad one. The thing is that I'm late for college up north. I don't know Bogota and I could get lost. If I get lost, that would be a huge loss. Could you take me? I'll pay you three times as much. Oh, thanks! What did I say? Carito was good. She's wonderful. Oh, let's not declare victory. She just took the taxi, that's it. Question. When has Martinez taken any of us anywhere? Not even paying him. I've asked him to take me and he has never done it. - Alcides is right. Yes. - Thank you, Mrs. Ramona. Hey, I'm really lucky. And you're very nice because if it weren't for you, I'd be screwed. As I said, I just arrived from Manizales. I studied Psychology for two terms but I requested being transferred to Bogota so the university up north. But at first, I was a bit scared. Oh, I love Bogota. But you hear so many things about it! I think that's why I took so much time deciding to request the transfer. Until one day I got up and I said, "No more, Carolina! No more!" I packed my bags, my dreams, my wish to progress and here I am. Fulfilling my dreams. Hey, I talk too much. Don't I? Well, your turn. Tell me. Are you single? A widower? Married? Divorced? Do you have a girlfriend? Do you study? Do you work? Tell me a bit about yourself because it's a long way. I know Bogota is big. Can I... tell you a joke? But I'm sure you won't laugh. I left my money at home. But I'll pay this afternoon. Do you agree? You can come by the apartment and I'll pay you. Thank you so much. Oh, you're so nice. Hey, you're a great man. Thanks! Bye. A promise is a promise. I came to keep my word. Thank you so much. You can keep the change. I was kidding! What did you think? It was a joke. A bad one. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. Are you busy? I would like to tell you something. Thanks. Unbelievable. The thing is that Linda's birthday is next week. I was thinking about celebrating it but I don't know, I was thinking for example about a birthday party. Isn't that great? I'm glad you like the idea because... I don't know anyone in this building. I think you're really cool so I thought that you could help me. Mmm... Well, the thing is that I... don't get along with the other neighbors. You don't? Really? Yes, there are some issues related to the building. Oh. Alright. We could kill two birds with one stone. We'll celebrate Linda's birthday and you'll also have the chance to solve the issue with your neighbors. Listen to this. We had Social Psychology class today and we were talking about the importance of celebrations to strengthen and bond social cells or groups. Listen. In short, if parties didn't exist, we would kill each other right away. So... what do you say? Will you help me? No, no, no. This is too much. Spending money in fake birthday celebrations. We just agreed that the girl would convince the caveman to leave this building! Listen. Let's think about something nice. Ever since Carito arrived... Oh! Ever since Carito arrived, we haven't had any more issues with that man. What does that mean? That Carito is doing things well. Alcides, if we continue like this, we're going to be bankrupt! You don't know how much was Linda's birthday for her fake birthday party. Drink this. Let's do it all for the cause and that's it. - Yes. Cheers. - No, Sir. Not for the cause. You must tell your friend to focus. We have to make Martinez leave the building, otherwise we'll be broke. Look at them. Complaining instead of being happy. Oh, no! That man has arrived! Oh. And on top of it all, having to receive that thug in my own home? Enough. Why are you always like this, Ramona? Let's breathe. Let's breathe and think about this. We're going to get rid of a nightmare. Hopefully. I hope we're not just being fooled by an opportunistic woman. What if the cure is worse than the disease? I'm just saying! Enough. - Welcome! - Good evening. How are you? Hi. - Why the mystery, Mrs. Ramona? - Wait and you'll see. - Surprise! - Surprise! - Happy birthday, neighbor! - Thanks! - Happy birthday. - Thanks! - Oh, how nice. - This is so nice! This is for luck. - Happy birthday! - Oh, so witty. Thanks. Happy birthday. Oh, why all of this? Happy birthday! Thanks! Oh. Happy birthday! Thanks. And the hug? Yes, a hug. Come on, just one. Alright. A small one. Happy birthday. Why all this? That's it! Dance contest! Turn around! Bridge! What's up? I have a question. How much are the dancing lessons? - Pay attention. - Come on, come on. Six, seven, eight and go. Six, seven. - And one... - Sorry. No. Move this one that way and move this one this way. Okay? Go. One, two, three, and go. That's it. Hey! Give me some! Three, four, five, six, seven, and go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Again. One, two, three... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and turn. Ouch! Five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, and go. A violinist? Yes. Why? Do you think it's odd? Mmm... Yes, a bit. But... what happened? The thing is that my father also thought it was odd and he said I had no talent for music. He said that someone with such small hands couldn't play the violin well and I couldn't make a living out of that. So he didn't want to buy the instrument or pay for the classes. And once I was old enough to do it myself, it was too late because you have to start playing violin... Okay. Anyway, anyway. I couldn't do it, I still have that frustration, and that's my story about the violin. And your father? Where is he? I don't know. In five or six years, I haven't talked to him. We have a bad relationship. Why? Because of the violin thing? Because of the violin thing and many other things. Have you ever considered fixing things with him? You know? I think some things can't be fixed. Well... According to Freud, our relationship with our parents influences people's personality. Have you ever considered going to therapy? Oh. Look. Some things inside us can't be solved and we have to learn to live with them. Living a normal life, like a normal person. A normal person. Okay. And who is a normal person? The one who becomes a nightmare to others? I have heard some things. No. Let's clear things up. Those are issues related to the building. No. Let me tell you something. Neurosis may take different forms. One of them is taking it out, releasing all that anger and resentment towards people around us. Do you think that's fair, Cheo? You didn't tell your father how you felt when he didn't want to support your dream of playing the violin. - No. - Why? - What for? - What do you mean? You don't know the therapeutic value of words. Saying things often reliefs us. Cheo, why... don't you talk to your dad and tell him how you feel? No. If you want, I can come with you. What is that music? It's "Nocturne op.9 No.2" by Frederic Chopin. It's the shit! - Can I turn it up? - I'll do it. Thanks! Is it here? Yes. Are you sure your dad still lives here? Well, he never leaves this place so I'm sure he's in there. Let's go. Don't worry. You're doing it right. God, I hope. Dad? Dad. Dad? Ezequiel, son. How many concerts a year... so how much money does he... will always mean the death of creative spirit, and money doesn't guarantee the quality of... I totally agree. That's what we are talking about. That's true. But real art will always be a matter of... The thing is that you haven't listened to him. We want to listen to him. Cheers... Cheers. Cheers, dad. Okay, so I would like you to talk about reggaeton. No, please. You guys attacked me as a group. No, you were the one who attacked us. - This way. - Thanks. No, sir. And you know what? I think you are identical. Just as stubborn. Right. Us? Stubborn? Thanks. In a long time... I hadn't had so much fun. And let me tell you that your father is very different from what you said. I think this was an exception to the rule. I think he just liked you. I think he's in love. - Good night. - Good night. Get some rest. And dream of me. I was kidding. It was a joke. A good one. - Alright. - Good night. Good night. What are you thinking about? About your dad. My dad? And you. In fact, about you two. You agreed on almost everything. But... we came to do something else. I know. Why don't you do it now that you're in good terms... and talk about what happened when you were a child? Is that... absolutely necessary? Well, I'm sure that if you talk and solve your problems... things like the ones that happened tonight won't be an exception but the rule. Okay, fine. You're the psychologist. I'll talk to him first thing in the morning. Everything will work out, you'll see. Dad? Dad? Dad. Dad. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. May he rest in peace. Your father was very sick. I don't understand. He was perfect yesterday. Yes. He was probably waiting for you because he wanted to see you one last time to then rest in peace. He used to talk a lot about you. He loved you very much. Well, I was your father's lawyer for over 20 years. During that time, Mr. Asdrubal was able to amass a fortune. - My father? - Yes. Your father. He invested in the New York stock exchange. He invested in securities and in trust funds that yielded excellent dividends. Look. In short, when your father died, he was a rich man. And his last wish was for you to inherit it all. My father? These are some presents. The one on top. Carolina and I wanted to bring them. A small gift. A small gift for you and... this is for me. Please enjoy. Thanks. Mmm... No. Please. You can open them later. Now... I would like to tell you something important. I want to... apologize for being the man I've been during this time we have lived in this building. I'm aware that maybe I've been a bad neighbor... a nightmare, a pain in the neck. From the bottom of my heart, I apologize. I want to commit myself to being a better person from now on. - Oh! - How nice. Cheito. I can't believe that you really believe he wants to change! You're so ungrateful! I do think he's being honest. Look at this great gift! Of course, dad. He's being honest because he's trying to impress the girl who Alcides brought? Yes, I think she's right. Nobody changes from one day to the next. Especially a jerk like him. Oh, but we have to admit that ever since Caro came to the building... Cheo hasn't bothered me again. Listen. Unbelievable. I'm surprised, Aurora. You're selling yourself just because he paid for some dance lessons? Enough. You know what, Mr. Ramona? You should take estrogens, progesterone or something so that menopause doesn't hit you that badly. Come on. Please, wake up. Are you forgetting who that jerk was before? - Such a brute? - But he's a jewel. And we must understand that the guy is a millionaire now. That's what I mean. When he was poor, he was a jerk. Imagine him now, with money! I'm just saying. Once people are something, they don't change. Yes, exactly. My daughter is right. Let's not lose focus or forget our original plan, which was hiring that girl so we could get rid of that moron. Let me remind you that we are paying for that... and it's a lot of money! Cheo... have you ever considered leaving this building? - Leaving? - Yes. I'm asking because you have the financial means. You could go to a better place. I would do it. Do you think I should? Well... it's not like you should... but... I'm just curious, I want to know if you have considered it. That's all. You know? It's not a bad idea. As long as you come with me. It's an idea I've always had but I hadn't found a capital investor. So recently I told myself, "Abundio, you're such a fool. He's your neighbor. Cheito is your ideal partner." A billiard hall? A booming business. It's a very successful business. I have analyzed it. I have studied the sector. I even have thought of a place. So Cheo, should we do it? Cheo, it's only 18 million pesos. I don't know why it breaks down so often. Don't worry. First, we should open a dance school. And second... we should start a band. It's not such a high investment. And the profit is guaranteed. This is not like a billiard hall. No, this is a very profitable business. Really? We'll talk later to see... Thanks. Alright. What did Linda want? Her truck broke down and she's thinking about changing it. Oh. She asked for a loan. Yes, but a small loan. Will you lend her the money? I think I will because... she needs it and we'll also help her to make her life better. Okay, let's go. Yes. Up north, right? Yes. Okay, first of all, my friends, I want to thank you for being here. Thank you so much for joining me today, which is a very special day to me as I can show you my work. My life's work. It's been done with love, with effort. And that effort has a name. The name is... Ezequiel Martinez. Ezequiel? Who we have always called Cheito. Cheito. That's right, Cheito. Cheito. My sponsor. A philanthropist. Someone who has always believed in culture, in talent. Someone who believed in my work. A work that I have devoted my life to. Cheito, this exhibit is dedicated to you. Thank you so much. To him... a big round of applause. Bravo! Applause! I want to apologize. I'm dressed like this because I have a serenade. I just want to say that we can't allow Cheo to leave the building. Wait a minute! No, let me ask a question. How is the billiard hall doing? - That's not... - Amazing. Absolutely amazing. So much that were thinking about expanding the place. Sure. And where will that money come from? Or for example, where will those two trucks you want come from? Or you're such a big artist and you want to take your exhibits abroad. Besides, we're doing great with the band and the school. I totally agree with Roberto. We can't allow Cheito to leave the building yet. - No. - No. No. Alcides, you must talk to your friend. - Yes, yes. - Yes, Alcides. - It's your obligation. - Yes, yes. Let's see, let's see. I would gladly talk to her. But the one we have to convince is Mireyita. Do you like it? You know? I do. It reminds me of a great photographer from Madrid. No, I'm not talking about the picture. I'm talking about your situation. About your situation with those who are your friends now. Especially your girlfriend. Do you like your situation, Cheo? I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about. It's just that I... know things... and if you found out... you'd be really surprised. That's all I'll say. Mireyita, should we leave? No, why? Honey, you're a bit tipsy and you become annoying. And so talkative that you start to say things that nobody understands. Let's go, darling. Your dad is going to make tamales. No, I don't want to, mom. Let's go, come on. Excuse me, Mr. Martinez. Bye. Change of plans? Yes, we need Cheo to stay a bit longer. Yes, we need you to convince Cheo to stay in the building. That's all. Easy. But Alcides, you had told me to... Baby, let me tell you something. We are going to give you three times as much as we offered. Just make the guy stay for six more months, that's it. It's an excellent offer. It's a lot of money. Don't you think that's a lot of money? Easy. You know? It's very satisfying to be able to help people to fulfill their projects... it's like being part of their dreams. But I also feel that sometimes it is necessary to be a bit selfish. And think, I don't know... a bit more about ourselves. That's why I have a surprise. What happened? The thing is that... tomorrow... we're going on vacation. Everything included. Thanks! This isn't just living. This is living a wonderful life. Thanks. This is the life we deserve. I have to confess that I love Bogota. I like it. But I think this weather is the best! Because I have a special connection with the sun. I was kidding. It was a joke. But to be honest, every time I sunbathe, it's like having ten more years to live. It's the best. I'm glad to hear that. I was thinking about what you said about moving to a different apartment and I think you're right. I would like to buy a house by the ocean... where there's plenty of sun... A house where I can share my life. Share my life with you. Carolina... would you allow me to make you the happiest woman in this world? Do you want to marry me? Let me get a stronger drink. Can I have a double tequila shot? I can't believe this. Hi! How are you? Don't you remember me? I'm a customer at the place where you work. By the way, I haven't seen you in that joint for a while. You took me for someone else. No. I've seen those tits and that ass so many times at the bar that I could never ever take you for someone else. So? What are you doing here? Working? With a customer? Please don't bother me. Don't react like that. Listen. I'm at a convention with my company. Just guys. How about you gather some girls like you... and we throw a party tonight? I'll make the company pay. And the pay will be good. Sir, stop. Don't bother me! You're so annoying! Stop pretending you are who you're not. Act accordingly or I'll call the hotel manager right away. They shouldn't allow cheap whores in a 5-star hotel. How dare! What happened? No, nothing. Easy, easy. Nothing happened. Enjoy. Are you okay? Yes. He was a bit drunk and started to say stupid things. Caro? Honey? Caro? Carolina? Carolina? "By the time you read this letter, I'll be far away and we will never see each other again. I know you'll have many questions and you won't understand why I'm doing this. But I ask you... I beg you... not to try to find any explanation. All you have to know is we can't be together. Although you're one of the best people I have ever met... although I've lived beautiful times next to you... I can't return all of that love. Please forget me. If possible, just remember me as a nice memory. From the bottom of my heart... I hope you're happy. You deserve it more than anybody else. Carolina." God! You scared me! Where is she? Who? Where is your cousin Carolina? Where is she? What do you mean? I don't know. Weren't you together on vacation? Mireya. Mireya, excuse me. - Hi. - Question. Do you remember... at Alcides' exhibit you asked me if I was happy about my situation? My situation with my girlfriend? Remember? No, I don't remember that, Cheo. Yes. Remember you said you knew things I didn't know and those things would surprise me. Question. Is that somehow related to Carolina? I don't know. How could I know? Of course you know, you told me that! I was drunk, don't you remember? Mireya, please. I need to know. Please. If you know something about Carolina, please tell me. I need to know, please. It's just that... I can't help you because I have no idea, Cheo. I'm sorry. She's so unprofessional. How can she just disappear without telling us anything? I didn't know what to say. Cheo threw himself on the car, asked about Carolina, and I didn't even have her phone. And I'm supposed to be her cousin. Listen, the thing is that Cheo is depressed. So he doesn't want to help with anything. Right? For example, I had to pay the orchestra. I had to arrange some sound issues. When I went there, he mistreated me. He pretty much sent me to hell. Exactly the same happened to us when we asked him for some money for renovating the billiard hall. At some point, I saw exactly the same jerk from last year in front of us. You didn't speak nicely to him. No, we can't allow that. We're screwed. I already took the loan to buy those two trucks. How am I going to pay? He doesn't want to talk to me, he doesn't answer the phone, nothing. No, Alcides, you're the girl's friend. Go find her and make her finish the job. - No... - That's right. You're absolutely... Alcides, offer her more money. As Mrs. Ramona said, she has to finish the job. She can't leave us like this. No. We need Cheo to produce oxytocin because when he's in love, he's happy and therefore he's more generous with all of us. You'll have to do something. You got us into this. And you'll get us out. You'll get us out. You can't wash your hands of this. No, sir, no way. What will you do? Tell us. That's all your money. You can count it. All of it. Carito, honey. What happened? I didn't finish the job and since I didn't finish, I won't charge. That's how things are with me. Let's see. What do you want? Just tell us what you want. If she wants more money, we'll give her more money. - We have more money. - Yes. No, this isn't a money issue. What is it then? I don't feel good when deceiving a person like Cheo. For God's sake. You sleep with men for money. And now you're so worried? All of them know what they're doing. But Cheo doesn't know what you're doing to him. And that isn't right. So you will give us a lesson about what's right and what's not? What a funny girl. You can laugh as much as you want. But don't look for me anymore. Your money is there. It seems it is all you care about. Bye. Good luck. Wait a minute. Carito! Honey! What a decent whore. No, Roberto, you shouldn't have talked to her like that. How should I have done it? Stop! We're not going to fight. What are we going to do? I can't believe it. See? I told you those men were hiding something. I told you. This is inconceivable. You brought a whore to our building? Well, he... No, let's see. Mrs. Ramona. Tell me something. How could we have found someone who was willing to follow the plan you came up with? - Tell me. - Us? Why didn't you say anything? Because we wanted to avoid all this drama. Roberto, you knew all of it and you lied to me. I can't believe it. No, honey, I didn't go in. I waited for them on the first floor. Besides, let's avoid the drama. Let's not make a drama out of this. How disgusting. And that tramp was living in my apartment! You're so disgusting, Alcides. You really are. You should've told us at least. Not only that. It's dangerous. Have you checked your stuff? She might have stolen something. Those women are thieves! No, Carito is not a thief. Ladies! You're absolutely right. From all viewpoints, what these men did was... so dirty. Disgusting pigs! But okay. We have a problem and we must be practical. We have a problem in this building that only that whore can help us solve. But she doesn't want to. Just offer her more money! No, he already did! Oh, sure. I guess you weren't convincing enough! I'm sorry but tramps like her would do anything for money! - Enough! - No, no. Enough, Ramona! That girl you call whore, tramp, streetwalker... has shown us she has more decency and dignity than all of us! What? So we're to blame? Abundio! Why are you saying that? You must respect me! With all the money she asked for... Show some respect. Can you hear that? See? The same old thing. And we paid so much money. It was useless. It was totally useless. What you did was useless. - We're back to the same place. - And you... someone who does work. Someone who works to get what you want. All the money... Hi. Hello. Cheo, I... I know where you can find Carolina. So everything was a lie? No. It depends... on what "everything" means to you. So you never studied psychology? Yes. A couple of years ago, I took some classes in college. But not all dreams come true. Why did you do everything you did to me? Why did you deceive me? Please, Cheo, I don't want to talk anymore. Believe me, I'm really sorry. If I could turn back time, I would. And I would've never crossed your path. But you did. Please forgive me. I knew I would find you sooner or later. And I knew I would find you here because obviously you go back to where you belong. Hey, brother... Don't get yourself killed over such small thing, brother. Many women are better than her in this joint. Shall we leave, honey? Careful with what you do. You don't want to get in trouble with me. Right? No, wait a min... I admit for a long time... maybe... I may have been a bad neighbor. A nightmare and a pain in the neck. But I always behaved like that in front of you. You always knew what to expect from me. But what you did... is deceiving. Playing with someone's most sacred thing... his feelings... and besides, due to ambition and money. That's filthy. However... you're all I've got. The only ones I can ask for help. I want to make a deal. I'm willing to give you all. All I have. And you know it's a lot. So that you help me... get Carolina back. Cheo... I would love to do it without asking for anything in return, of course. But how? How? I have a plan. What a great artistic show! Okay, honey, just tell me what you want. We're willing to satisfy our customers. Oh, I would really like that, girl. The thing is I'm unhappily married and even if my wife bothers me, she's the one I want to be with. So I'm here because I need some information. But don't worry. I will pay some money for that. Tito. That's the guy's name. Tito. Mediterranean, average gangster... a regular customer of the place that we knew thanks to our friend. He's the one who took Carolina. Why did he do it? They had a business togethe r and it failed. What happened? Carolina asked him to allow her to take some merchandise... Merchandise, right? To the United States. He owned the merchandise. Why did she do it? Because she wanted to earn some money. That girl wants to start a new life project. She's not bad. What happened? Everything failed, the merchandise was lost, the money was lost, and that is why Mr. Smuggler was looking for her. Okay. Is there a way to contact that Tito guy? When new girls are brought to the club, this guy Tito sends someone to pick them up to try them out. Good. Good info. That means that what we need is to find two new girls who help us discover Tito's location. Oh, no. No way in hell. I had never ever had to dodge so many drunk guys. And what for? For nothing! This plan is absurd. All we did was waste our time and expose ourselves to danger. I had fun. I talked to some people. Do you know of much money those girls make in one night? Linda. Are you out of your mind? I was just... Girls, let me tell you something. I have a plan for you. Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. On the contrary, you'll make some money and we'll have a good time. What do you think? Should we go? - For sure! - For sure! Let's go! Let's go, babies. I'll get in, don't worry. Come on up. We'll have a great time tonight. Come on. Alright. Let's go. Hello? Hi, it's me. Where are you? I'm at the target's home. Do you have the address? Yes, but... Listen, I need you to come asap because... because I don't know what may happen tonight. Cheo. We should tell the guys where we're going. No. If we tell them where we're going, they'll get scared and they won't act naturally. We need them to think they're going to a normal show. Right, Cheo. But if I do that, they won't forgive me. What do you mean? So what did you do? Oh, sorry. I'll take her for a minute. She'll be right back. Okay? What's wrong with you? What do you mean? What? You're behaving as if you really liked all of this. But we said that we were going to do it for real. Yes, but you're overacting. Stop. What? You know how much Tito pays if the customers are happy? No, I don't want to know and you don't want to know either! Seriously, Linda. So what's up, babies? Why so much talking? Let's go. My boss is waiting for you in his room. - Now? - Yes. Let's go so we can have a good time. Treat him like a king. Sure. Yes, sir. Let's go then. Come on. How can I help you? Good evening, my friends. This is the band. We were called by Mr. Tito. My dear girls. We'll have our own private party. How nice. Mr. Tito, and the money? Will you...? We'll see how hard you work for it. What do you mean? Like... what should we do? Well, take your clothes off slowly. Slowly. Then... kiss and touch each other... so we'll allow the pill to take effect. We'll see if I'm up to it. What's wrong with her? Is she going to cry? No, it's just that she's very emotional. What is it? Mr. Tito. Sorry to disturb you but you must come with me to the studio. It's urgent. Don't start without me. Wait a minute. You're here to see Carolina? Is she alive? That depends on what you want from her. We came to rescue her. Is that so? And... how are you planning on rescuing her? Well... we'll pay off her debt. That's a lot... a lot of money. How much, Mr. Tito? Are you really willing to pay so much for a whore? Yes. And for Mireyita and Linda. Who are they? Alright. The transaction is complete and the money is in one of my accounts. And Carolina? I'll let you go out alive for three reasons. First, the debt was paid off. Second, you were courageous enough to come to the wolf's cave. Third... I like people who is capable of doing crazy things for love, like this one. Believe it or not, I'm very romantic. That's beautiful, Mr. Tito. I'm so sorry about your money. You lost it all. I have always made a living from working. I can do it again. Why didn't you tell me anything? Do you remember you asked if everything had been fake? It wasn't, Cheo. Not all of it. What I ended up feeling for you was real. It's the most genuine and real feeling I've ever had. Almost... the only... beautiful thing that has ever happened to me. So? I didn't want to hurt you with something as terrible as the truth. I hoped our relationship would become a beautiful memory... a promise of happiness that would help me to continue to live. If you had told me, I had understood... No. Please don't. Let's not talk about what could've happened but didn't happen. It's not necessary. Okay. I hope you can forgive me one day... and you can think of me without any hard feelings. You're a very smart woman. Wasting your life at that place where you work isn't worthwhile. Let's see. Over here. TWO YEARS LATER I know what's wrong! Go ahead! Try it! Perfect! Cheo, you're a lifesaver. Thank you. Don't worry. Just go, pick up the kids and we'll check the engine tonight. You got it. Thanks! Okay, take care. Watch out! My friend, could you do me a favor? Could you turn it up? I love that song. Of course, gentleman. The customer is always right. Bravo! Carolina? Cheo? Abundio was a bit sick because... you know? So Ramona had to get in charge and help him overcome things. Mireya met a guy online. An American guy. A fair-haired, blue-eyed guy. She went to the United States to live with him. Alcides had a new exhibit at a gallery. He did great. It's called "A man's gaze." Very nice. Linda has a boyfriend. No! Who is it? A very nice guy. His name is John Mario. He's a philosophy teacher. A very good guy. She's happy. How nice. What about Roberto and Aurora? They did it. No! They'll become parents! How exciting! They're happy. That's great. I'm really glad. And... well... I'm surprised to see you. I didn't know you like this music now and you came to these concerts. Yes. I like this music now. When I met you, that love of classical music was born. And now, I collect CDs. I'm starting a collection. Amazing. And... What's up? What are you up to? I finally left the bar. And... now I teach at a kindergarten. Wonderful! Yes. And I'm doing my fourth semester of Psychology. That's even better. What about you? How are you? How is your heart? Single? Married? Divorced? All of them? None of them? Single. And... quiet. Willing. But I'm fine. That's good. How are you? Single? Married? Divorced? All of them? Single. Single, because when you work and study, there's no time for love. Right. I'm glad to see you're fine. I'm glad... everyone is doing well. Please say hi to everyone. - Bye. - Bye. Carolina! Tonight... Roberto and Aurora will have a baby shower. I was wondering if you would like to... come and say hello yourself. But I have no gift. Well... we could say that my gift is from both of us. Is it a nice gift? Yes. It's a joke. A bad one. Let's go. To be honest, the gift is awful.
