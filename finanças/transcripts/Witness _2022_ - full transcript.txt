He always said life should be like an ICU. Every moment should be like life and death. He hated the word 'Cool'. He said the word 'Cool' always made him imagine 40 idiots travelling in a bus, playing a musical game just to pass time. The word Cool has turned the world into a mediocre one. Time-pass. Poetry, business, relationships' ups and downs. Nothing should be cool. Everything should be 'Gaand Faadu' That was his word. 'Gaand Faadu' Hey.. hey.. This is me. Okay? When the queue moves, keep on pushing it. I'll continue with my running. - Hey Tukaram. - Yes. You might pass the physical test for the job in the Police department. But what about the writing test? Don't worry. I will do something about it. This is me. When the queue moves, keep on pushing it. This is me, okay? - Meanwhile, I'll continue running.. - I know, you're a stone. And run fast. Who's in the third toilet? Abhay. His result will be out today. He won't come out until the result is out. But that's not our problem Let me check on him. Excuse me. Come out. We can't control anymore. Open it or else I will slap you Who's going to slap me? Huh? Abhay. - Where's Abhay? - That's me. - Abhay, you've done it. - Third toilet. - What? - Third toilet. Come out, man. 94.7. Come out. You've done it. Just out of toilet, right? - At least wash your hands. - Hey, I didn't use the toilet. I was waiting for the result. Admit that you were scared. I am never scared. Admit it, buddy. You were scared? It was difficult to control. - Hey.. hey.. - Let me tell the result to mom. Listen. How did you score 94%? Similar to you trying to build your muscles, I scored 94.7%. I will somehow clear the physical test. But will need help in writing test. Will you please help me? - Yes, sure. - When shall I start with you then? I will let you know. Now go. Tell me now. Listen, even I have to go jogging. And tell the result to my mom. Now go. See someone stole your stone.. Go. Hey.. that's.. - That's me. - Yes, that's you. Go. - Okay, I will see you later. - Bye. Formal education was my last backup plan. According to me, the ones who make money after a degree are the ones who fail to study life. Read the world. Say, for instance, a man becomes an endocrinologist. After investing 12 years studying medicine.. ..the business possibilities ends at 2 mm. Hell, we are a 130-crore populated nation We've consumers of urea, herbal medicine We also have consumers for con men. If you know how to study the world.. ..it's very easy to be rich in this country. But in our attempt to sell people like me never realize... ...when we start selling ourselves. Today when this oxygen tube is up my nose and the ECG graph is going crazy This girl, who's sitting in front of me. This one, it should be written all over her face 'I told you so.' But it's not written That is love, I suppose. Formal education benefited me in one thing. In that college classroom I met this woman. The love of my life. Manjiri, the results are out. Let me do it. Will you be able to do it? Let me try. Here, you go. Do it properly. Keep it tight. Easy. You will injure your finger. Be careful. Let me do it. Whatever your Class 12 result may be. I'm giving you a zero in peeling these betel nuts. To hell with these betel nuts. I'm not doing this to help you. Just trying to distract myself... okay? I know. Anyways, you never help me. And what's this? Why are you so worried? Even if you get 90%, It's not like you want to become a doctor. You are only interested in poetry And 60% is enough to take admission in arts. I know. But I want to prove to society that I was capable of studying medicine. Yet I chose to major in arts (poetry). "The world seems to me like a child's playground" "Endlessly, the play called life is enacted before me" "My honesty holds me back, when temptations allure me" "As I put one God behind me, another one seeks me" "Do not look.." "Do not look at the colours draining from me after you leave" "Do not look at the colours draining from me after you leave" "Just look at the colours filling you up by my presence" Glory to Lord Ganesha. As a lover, I live off the art of fooling the beloved Your daughter's result will be declared today, right? At least today let's worship the lord in a religious way.. I'm reciting Galib's couplets to the Lord. - Isn't it a kind of worship? - Sir.. There he is. Tell us the result. Be quick. I will first declare it to the Lord. Go ahead. Lord. It's 92.7%. Glory to Lord Ganesha. Stop. Stop. - What's the result? - what's the percentage? - 92.. - .7 - 92.7% - Yes. Glory to Lord Ganesha. Not here, dad. He will miss it. No no, he never misses it. Wow. Three. Listen. You will get to learn from world-class professors of literature. Don't look at the beaches in Mumbai. At Chowpatty, don't look at the sea. Rather observe the people. That's where you will find poetry And listen This village of ours? It is like a beautiful small nature poem. Isn't it? Keep walking. Where did you learn this English? I absorbed all the English that managed to reach this village. So, I was telling you that our village is a small, beautiful poem of nature. And Mumbai is epic. A saga. Mumbai is beautiful, as well as dreadful. It's cruel, as well as kind. Once you're in Mumbai, the first thing you will learn.. ..is, not every poem is beautiful. But you will find poetry in everything, everywhere. Try to feel it. Okay? And... Now you will visit us on Diwali. After 161 days. These are the 161 inland letters. You will write to me every day. Dad, those days are gone now. I will listen to you if you call me. But the real joy lies in the letters. Because your father is a postmaster. Yes. Catch it. Catch it. Manjiri, is your result out? 92.7%. - That's it? - Yes. I had sent six boats towards you. How many did you manage to catch? Show me your result. Show me, quickly. There he is. 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. Wow. I got 92%, but you got 100%. How do you manage to defeat me every time? He is a champion. Let's do it together. Come on. 1.. 2.. 3.. - No.. not again. you always defeat me. - Yes. Did you swim for half an hour? Now, go back to work. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Dad. How did you make him so confident? What's the meaning of confidence? Being happy with oneself. I gave him a reason to be happy with himself. He swims and goes to the field. He grows crop, you know? You know what his parents say about you? What? If it weren't you, their son... No... no... I haven't done anything. God wrote an incomplete poem and told me to complete it. I'm just following his orders. Right? Let's go. - Is your result out? - 92.7%. Yes. 94.7%. Won't you say anything? 94.7%. I knew it. Hmm. Hmm. What are you doing? How many times should I correct you? Don't drink tea like this. It's my habit. Did you tell him? Yes, I will tell him now. I wanted to tell you first. 94.7%. Great. Seek God's blessings today at least. Move. Don't do it for the sake of it. Do it because you have faith in the almighty. - You can never do it. - I do try. But I fail. What's your future plan? To make money. Do that later, first complete your education. Education is a waste of time, I want to start making money as soon as possible. In a few years I want to start something of my own. Ask your God to buy you new batteries. Every morning I pull this thing to start your auto But how do you manage the entire day? I never stop, son. Yes. Roxy is celebrating for you. Hey. Lift him. Hey. Why do you drink so much if you can't handle it? I cannot handle 'not drinking' as well Are your results out? Huh?. Our mother is dying Stay at home. Get away. Scum. You will die if you drink so much. Let me die. Why do you bother looking for me every day? Let me die. Go. - Hey.. hey.. - Be careful. You still want to die? Leave it, Abhay. I don't care if you die. But I won't let you die before mom. - Come on. - Take him away. Let's go. Hey.. Chhotu. He will come. Let's go. Get away. - He will come later. You come with me. Chhotu. Chhotu. Be careful. This shouldn't break. - Do one thing. - What's it? I will stay back. Let this luggage go instead of me. Listen.. Your father is a loved personality around here.. Yes. So, people have given these gifts out of love. See this. I brought it for you. - Take care, dear. - Thank you. I won't take this along. Please. He has given it with love. Yes, so you relish the love then. Listen. Listen to me. Hmm. You've to impress a girl from a reputed college. Do you get it, fucker? Look at your slippers. It's torn. There is nothing left after paying the college fees Once I manage to overcome this fact, I will think about the slippers Listen.

How do you know? Well I dreamt about it. Let it be. Okay, listen. I've managed to get some better clothes for you. How? You know the electrician Navin, who died last week?
