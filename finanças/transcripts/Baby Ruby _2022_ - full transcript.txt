- Shh! - You're up early. What's all this? - For the shower. It's today. - Isn't that a little strange? - What? - Throwing your own baby shower. - It's just because I need it to be perfect. It's- it's barely anything, just people from work, and Caroline's helping. - Mm-hmm. - What? - Nothing. - Stop making that head. - You mean that face? What face should I make? This face? This face? - I hate you. - This face. - Stop making fun of me! You're frightening me! - Come here, you. - Are you crazy? Stop! Careful. I'm gonna break this. - You're crazy. Now I can't move. I can't move. Much easier. No, no, no, no. No. I can't, I can't move. I'm like a turtle on its, on its back. - You're like a turtle? - I'm like a turtle- - A turtle? - on its back. - Hi, turtle. - Oh my god! Would you come down from there, please? - I'm fine. - Come on. I'll help you down. Yeah, it, it's done. - Oh, there it is. - It's done. - Thank you. Okay, what do you think? - Nice. Now it's perfect. - Jo! This place is amazing! And it was such a quick drive from the city. I can't believe it. Whoa! Oh my god. Okay. Hi! Hello! Wow! Jo. How have you been? There we go. Anybody else want some sparkling cider? - Sure, whatever. - Sure. - To Jo. Can you please stand up for us? Yes. - Come on. - Yes, yes. To the best boss lady ever. You are an entrepreneur, a leader. You tripled our readership this year. It's true. You launched the online shop, you moved upstate, you did this insane renovation, by the way, all the while answering every single one of our readers' comments personally. And oh, by the way, you know, making a human. We would all hate you if we did not absolutely love you. - Ugh! - I feel just so grateful to be part of the "Love, Josephine" family. - Aw! - Cheers! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Oh no! - I know, I know, I said, I told myself I was not gonna cry, but I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh, thanks, but I'm not going anywhere. Nothing's going to be any different. It's just a baby. How big are they even, you know? It's like a little, a little, a little donut, a little brioche. - Cheers. - Cheers, Jo. Bye! - What do you think? - I think it's a little small for me. - But it's your color, no? - It is my color, but, this is better, no? - Oh! Oh, Spencer, look at this sweater. It's perfect. - When's the big day? - What? - The baby. - Oh, uh, any day now. - Aw! Are you scared? - Should I be? Can I, can I see your baby? - No. You never wake a sleeping baby. - And she stops my hand. She stops my hand like I'm, like I'm radioactive or something. - Ah. - Just a sip. Ah, I wonder that could be. - Ah, shh. She's just lonely. - Ah, no! - Ah. Mom, hi. - Hi, honey. I don't want to intrude. I was just driving by. - No, no, it's fine. Come on in. - Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't. - Okay. - Hi. Hi, Jo. - Hi! - I made these for you. For the cravings. - Ah. - Try one. - What's in it? - Secret recipe. Magic bars. Okay, fine. Peanut butter, coconut, butterscotch, chocolate, crushed maraschino cherries, and bacon bits. Who knows? Maybe they'll induce labor. - Thank you. - All right. Well, I'm off. You two enjoy your last precious moments. - Sit down, Doris. Just join us. - Oh, Jo, I've told you a million times, call me Mom. Speaking of which, I was thinking, Grandma doesn't feel right to me. Maybe Gaddy or Giddy, Momo or Mimi or Moomoo or Googoo or Gigi or Geegaw. - "Can't wait..." Oh, settle down in there. Mommy's trying to concentrate. - God. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Just... Oh. - Ah, Jesus - Something's weird. Do you think, uh... - Ah, yeah, I think it's happening. - Okay. - No, please! - Okay, honey. - Get the fuck away from me! - Five. Two. One. - Everything okay in here? - Yes. - Yeah, of course. - Have you pooped yet? - No. - You can't leave until you poop. - Thank you. - Ah, you too. - Thank you so much for everything. Oh, you too. - Thank you so much. - Oh, can we get a photo? - Yeah, yeah. Photo, photo. - Will you get one of us? - This will be her first photo. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay, bye. - Goodbye. - Wait! You forgot the placenta! Better than forgetting the baby, right? I thought you wanted to eat it. - The baby? - The placenta. It's all nutrients. Thank you. - Good luck. - Ah. - Okay, I think she's in. You ready? - Yeah. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. It's just, I wish my mom were here. - Okay. - You can go faster than two kilometers per hour. - Well, I have precious cargo. - I hope fatherhood is not going to turn you into a nervous old lady. - Now, why would you say that, deary? I'm your Giddy, your Gaddy, your Googoo, your Gaga, your- - Look at the road. Where are we? - Home. - Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. - Well, this says they like to suck, swaddle, and swing. - I don't need some book, Spencer. - Well, it says, "Over one million copies sold, so." - It's a cliche advice. I can do this. I can do this perfectly. Shh. Look. See? Well. Fuck! Who is ringing the doorbell in the middle of the fucking night? - We're here for the gutters. - Yes, Yes. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Sorry, sorry, I'm here. Um, I'm Caroline. I'm the assistant. We'll set you up right over there. Right over there. - Hi. - Just the guys here to work on the house. We'll be outside. We won't disturb you at all. And hey, I think our followers are still waiting on a baby pic. - Yeah. - It's been been a month. - Oh, uh, I'll get to it. - I could help you if it's easier. - No, I'm fine, I'm fine. - And I also had some- - Uh, Jo. Jo, I think she's hungry again. Shit. Okay. Okay. Shh. Okay. Yeah. Good girl. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Here we are. Hey. - Look. Look how perfect she is. - Yeah. Well, you made her. - We made her. - Okay. - Ah! Spencer! - What's going on, jo? - Ruby! - What's going on? - Of course, I completely forgot. I put Ruby up in her crib hours before. I mean, the look on Jo's face was... - I knew all along. You were more scared than I was. He's nervous about everything. - I am not. - First-time parents. The fears are very, very normal. Oh, one more question, though, if I may ask. The bone was who's? - Spencer's a butcher. An artisanal butcher. - I'm not an artisanal... I'm a butcher. You know, free range, He mainly killed no waste. - Anyway, the point is that we, we were very tired- - So we thought that maybe this was the time to, you know, come in and just check in and just get a little help. - No, we don't, we don't really need help, but just to- - Just to check in, you know. - Just to check in. - She cries a lot. - Well, the good news is she looks fantastic. Nothing to worry about whatsoever. Babies cry. It's tough, but, you know, wait till she's 18. That's really hell. Ah. Look at you! Oh, aren't you the sweetest little thing? She's adorable. - I think she looks a little thin. Is she too thin? - The doctor said she's perfectly normal. - Maybe she's hungry. Oh! She's got quite a strong suck. - Shh. - You know, people always say that new babies are cute. I think they all look like ET. I mean, some people thought ET was cute, but I just thought he was a creepy alien that should stay on his own planet and leave the rest of us alone. Anyway, if it's any consolation, I understand how you feel. Spencer was a crier. - Oh, he was? - Oh yeah. - Mom, don't talk her ear off. She's tired. - I'm fine. - Thank you, dear. I'm parched. - We're just hearing about how Ruby takes after you. - Mom, what have you been telling her about? - Nothing. You were a crier, you were. - I was an infant. - So? Take some responsibility for your own behavior. - Mom, you take some responsibility for your behavior. - I did take responsibility for my behavior. - So why do you blame- - Why are you arguing? I told you, this is. - I'll go upstairs. - Uh, will you be okay? - Will you? Well. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay, Ruby. It's okay. Shh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ruby! Ruby? Baby. You're okay? - Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, she's fine. - Oh my God. - I didn't, I didn't see it. - Oh, look, she's fine. Oh. People are such idiots. They completely fly down the street. It's terrifying. - I didn't, I didn't see it. - I know, I know. It's so scary. But that's why we strap them in. - You sure, you sure she's fine? - Yeah, she, l- look at her. She's beautiful. Oh. - Wait, I, I saw you at the baby store. - That's right, yes, I do remember you. Hi. - I had the baby. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. It's great. It, it really, it really is. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - I want you guys to meet, um... Oh my god, I didn't even catch your name. I'm so sorry. - Jo. - This is Jo, you guys. - I know you. "Love, Josephine." - The French girl style. The cheese souffle that broke the internet. - Oh my god! I cannot believe that's you. I'm such a fan. You're amazing. I tried to make your souffle for like a month. - Oh, it's easy. It's easy, truly. - "It's easy, truly." - I know. She's so chic, right? - I haven't seen your baby online yet. Maybe I missed it? - No, I haven't, I haven't posted yet. It's just, uh, I'm not sure with the babies. How do you do anything? Ruby cries a lot. And I know, I know babies cry. I know that. But sometime it's just, it's too much, no? And you guys look so happy and relaxed and rested, and your, your babies are, are so quiet. They don't even cry. What's your secret? I mean... - Trust your instincts. - I'm not sure about the outfit. - I don't think we should go. - Come on. It's just dinner. Ruby will be fine. - It's too much for your mother. - Well, she raised me, right? Look how great I turned out. It's nice for her to feel needed. Besides, are we never gonna have dinner again alone for the rest of our lives? - That was my plan? - We need this. - Oh, yes, you are. Oh, she smiled at me. Has she smiled before? Oh, you had your first smile. Ruby, you're so smart. She's so smart. - I missed it. - Okay, well, there's gonna be plenty of chances to see her smile and frown and cry and roll her eyes in complete disgust at her idiot parents. So come. We're gonna be late. Thanks, Mom. - Okay. - The, the, the milk is in the fridge. Just warm it up and make sure to test it. - We'll be fine. Just go on, you lovebirds. - You were right. This is, this is nice. - You see? Every now and again, I have a good idea. Not often. Like once a year. On leap years. Hey, what's up? - I kind of feel like I'm, I'm disappearing. - Um... Well, this is temporary. You know, pretty soon, you'll be back to work, photo shoots of diapers, baby food sponsorships. You'll be moving a mile a minute. Trust me. Everyone goes through this. - Really? - Yeah. You know, Freddy from work, after his kid was born, his wife got so freaked out, she just picked lint off the carpet all day. Uh-huh, and Jim, Jim's wife started buying all kinds of tiny, crazy cat figurines online. - I haven't bought one tiny cat. - I know. Because you're gonna be a great mom. - You have puke on your jacket. - I have what on my jacket? - You have puke on your jacket. - I have what on my jacket? - Wait, I- - What are you doing? - Give it to me. - No, no. - Just put a little bit of- - Control freak. No. I'll get it. Love you. - Sweet, sweet Ruby. Ruby. Ruby. Ruby. - Pick up the fucking. Doris, pick up the fucking phone! Sorry, I I... - Whoa, whoa, what's happening? - The monitor, the moni- It's probably nothing- - Jo, what's going on? - but I just have to go check on Ruby. Give me the keys to the car. - What are you talking- - The key to the car! - Jesus. - Oh my god! - Out of my way! - I'm so sorry. Jo, wait! - It's okay. It was our first time away from her. We'll get better at it. - What do you think it was? - You know, I think it's what my mom said it was. I think she was, um, putting a blanket on Ruby, and she kicked over the iPad. - But I heard whispering. - Yeah, it's just my mom whispering to Ruby. - What was she telling her? - Um... "Sleep tight," probably. - I'm... I'm okay now. - I know. I know. - I'm just gonna go check on Ruby. Okay? Oh, sorry, Ruby. It's okay. It's just Mommy. Shh. I won't leave you again, I promise. Okay? I won't leave you again. I won't ever leave you again. Never. Ow! You bit me. - Impalement, strangulation, suffocation. You sure that thing's secure? I would not want that to fall on her. Crush her like a bug. I don't love the look at these corners, and obviously, you're gonna need to get this construction cleaned up. - We are close. I dunno what's taking them so long. - Total death trap. - I know she's a little young to worry about all this now, but- - Never too early to start baby proofing. - Yeah, and she, she's very advanced. She, she already has teeth. Well, uh, I, I really want our home to be safe from her. - Safe for her. - Yeah. What did I say? - It's okay, I get it. We had twins. They almost killed me. - Whoa! Come on, slowpoke! - Oh, fuck, fuck! Ruby! I'm sorry baby. - Oh my god, Runaway Ralph! Here you go. - Oh, oh, thank you. - You okay? - God! I need, I need a cigarette. - Don't worry. It gets so much easier, I promise. - Running or the baby? - Oh, you poor thing. Is Ruby still crying a lot? - Yeah, it's, it's strange, she, she doesn't do it around other people, but she, she cries. - It's classic, right? - Do you... Do you ever feel like you're baby's angry with you? - I mean, when I take more than five seconds to do her bidding for her, yes. She's completely pissed all of the time. - I mean more like punishing you. - Punishing me for what? - I don't, I don't know. - You know what I think? I think that you really need to go out and, like, dance and get your old self back. We're actually all going out for mom drinks later, and I swear it's not as terrible as it sounds. - No, I can't. That's exactly what makes her angry. - Where are you going Jo? - Home. I, I need to focus on home. I'll see you around. - Jo. - I'm busy, Caroline. Can't you see? - Sorry, it's just that, um, Ruby's crying. - Babies cry. - She's been crying for over an hour. - Fine. - I'll get her, okay? Fine, Ruby. If that's what you want, I'm coming. I am not going to let you win. I am not going to let you win. Do you hear me? I'm not gonna let you win, Ruby. I'm not gonna let you win. I'm not gonna let you win! Hey. What's the occasion? - Nothing. I cooked. - What is it? - A surprise. - Where's Ruby? Jo? Jo, wait, please. Come on, wait. - Do you really think I'm crazy? - No, I don't. I don't think you're crazy. Look, this is hard on me, too. I'm fucking exhausted. - Oh, I'm sorry, but did, did you make an entire person inside your own body? Don't you understand that she's killing me? - And I'm saying that I wanna help. I'll go. - I'm fine. - No. Let me, just this once. - Okay. You see how you do. Go. Okay, Ruby. - Okay, uh... - I'm going out. You're so good with Ruby. You handle her for a night. - Okay, well, can you tell me where you're going. - Out, I said. - Jo, I, I don't think you should go out. - Why not? Afraid to be alone with her? - I'm dying to be alone with her. - So then, what's the problem, hmm? Dinner's on the stove, but you already know that, I think. There is pumped milk in the fridge for when Ruby's hungry. But be careful when you feed her. She bites. - Ruby. - You came! - Yeah. - Hi! - I needed to get out. - Your hair looks so cute. - It's falling out. - Hormones are a bitch. - Ruby. - Jo! Is it true that in France the government pays for you to rehab your vagina after you have a baby? - Oh, yes. We, we have physical therapy, yes. - Tell us about your childcare policies, because they're incredible, right? - Yes, yeah, we have, uh, we do have childcare, yes. - This country- - I can't even imagine. - Hey! This country's bullshit. - Yeah. - Everyone, note it. - I thought you all, I mean, you seem like you're doing so well. - Yeah, we're miserable. We are zombies. We are furious. - Uh-huh. - Honestly, the thing that really helped me through all of this was eating my placenta. I made it into a bolognese. - You're scaring her! - I'm not! - I forgot mine. - Let's dance! - Mine is still in the freezer. ♪ Lovers fall the hardest ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Lovers ♪ ♪ And lovers fall the hardest ♪ - Pump and dump, baby! - Yeah! Whoo! ♪ You better run, you better run ♪ ♪ You better run ♪ - Okay. I can't. Give me a minute. Give me a minute, please. - What is that? - It's Ruby. - Hey, Jo, it's Shelly. Where were you tonight? I thought, um, you were gonna come to mom drinks. We really missed you. - Fuck. - Where were you? - I fell asleep in a parking lot. Yeah, I wanted to go to a bar to have a drink, and I, I fell asleep before I even came inside. I slept for the first time in ages. - You couldn't even call? - I fell asleep, like I said. Where's Ruby? - She's upstairs in her crib. She's fine. Don't go up there and wake her. We actually had a really nice night together. - Good. I'm happy for you. - Yeah. Well, it was nice to get some time with her, finally. - Okay, well, I shouldn't, I shouldn't have come back at all, then. - Yeah, okay, that's not what I meant. I'm going to work. Someone around here has to. - This is typical man. You like to spend time with her on your terms, but then you leave whenever it becomes inconvenient. - All I said was it was nice, okay? You're the one who left all night. - I got tired, okay? I made a mistake one time. - Was it? A mistake? - What do you mean? - I don't know. You seem pretty unhappy. - I love her. You don't believe me? Hey, do not walk away from me, Spencer! Talk to me! - Great. You fucking woke her up! - Ah! It's okay, Ruby, I heard you. Just stop. There you go. Oh. Sorry. Sorry, baby. I'm sorry. - Well, the great news is she's grabbing. That's a big milestone. It's time to get one of those activity gyms so that she can grab things that don't cause you bodily harm. - So there's nothing wrong w- with her? - She's perfectly fine. - Uh, I'm sure you saw, but she has teeth. - Well, it's a little early for that, but all babies are different. - And she she doesn't seem angry to you? - What about? - No, nothing, I just, I mean... I would understand if she's disappointed. - In what? She's a baby. She's not old enough to be disappointed. Um... I'm gonna be right back. - Wait, w- where are you going? - Turns out she's due for some shots. This will only take a minute. - "What is your baby trying to tell you?" "What is your baby trying to tell you?" - Oh, she's completely lost her marbles. I worry that she might. - Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. - Hey, hey, you can't leave! - Uh, it's, it's not a good time, really. We'll come back. I was wrong. - Whoa, whoa, what are you doing here? - About everything. - Jesus. Ah, I'm sorry. - Shh. - She's not angry with me. Of course she's not angry. She's not. That was completely insane. There's nothing wrong with her. She's, she's not trying to hurt me. - Yeah. - She, she's trying to tell me something. It makes sense, you know, understanding your baby's cues. The, the, the crying, the grabbing. She's trying desperately to communicate with us, and the only way she can- - So what is she trying to communicate? - I don't know. I don't know. - Uh-huh? - I think she, she may be trying to warn us. - What did the doctor say? - I didn't tell him about this. He'll just think I'm crazy. - Yeah, I'm gonna take you home, Jo. Uh, I don't want her here, and, uh, when we, when we get back, maybe we can figure this out, and maybe you can get a little rest, hmm? - I don't need to rest. - Well, you can't figure this out when you're exhausted. - I'm not. - Hey, look at me. I love you. - I love you too. - Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Good girl. Good girl. - Hi. I thought I would bring you some tea. - Spencer shouldn't have bothered you, really. I can take care of Ruby myself. - Ruby isn't the only one who needs taking care of. - Thanks. - Oh, that's a classic. - Yeah, I, I didn't think I'd need these books, but- - I know. It's hell. - What? - Well, I told you about when Spencer was a baby. - Yes. You said he was a crier. - Oh, much worse than that. You know, this was back in my day. Men didn't do anything. I was all alone, and everybody kept saying, wasn't I so happy, and wasn't my baby a miraculous thing, and I, I felt so guilty because of course I loved him, but also, I hated him. I would dream about all the terrible things that could happen to him, and at first I thought it was because I was scared. I mean, all moms are scared. But then I realized I wished for it. I did. And one night, Spencer's father was on another business trip, and Spencer was crying and crying, and I tried everything, but nothing worked. And I was hot. Summer. It was dark outside, middle of the night. And I, I remember I just, I prayed to God for someone to come and just take this baby away from me so that I could go back to being who I was before. But also, I knew, I knew that wasn't gonna happen. I was, I was trapped. I put Spencer in his crib, and he was crying and crying and crying and crying, like a hammer, like, um, in my head, and I, I went down into the kitchen and I got our sharpest knife. - To kill yourself? - To kill him. I went back upstairs, and he was just- - Stop. Just stop. - Well, obviously, I came to my senses. I mean, I didn't do anything. - You have to stop. - Yes, and that's the problem. We can't talk about these things, not even to each other. We can't admit it. We can't even look at it. And so it grows stronger. - Ruby. - Hey, hey, um, my mom's staying over, so you can... - Voila. - I'm not that hungry. - Well, it's croissant, but we have to keep you fed. Oh, and your friend dropped by, Shelly. She dropped off a loaf cake. You're looking more rested already. - I didn't hear Ruby wake up in the night. I guess she slept through. - Good job, Ruby! - You didn't hear her, did you? - Not a a peep. Of course, I'm downstairs on the sofa, so. Not that I'm complaining. I just get a little twinge in my back. I know the guest room isn't finished, but I would love a firmer mattress. - I was thinking how helpful you've been that first night Spencer and I went out. - I know, you were so worried. - What was in those magic bars? I went into labor at the very night. - I hope you don't think- - Oh, what would I think? Just a typical nervous mom, no? - I promise you, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. I keep a very watchful eye. - So do I. - Jo, the guys are finally done with the gutters, if you wanna go give it a quick look. - I'll watch Ruby. - I'll be back in two minutes. Don't take her out of the swing. Do you want me to go up there? - No, no, no, I just- Oh my god! - Sorry. - That was a complete accident. What is wrong with you idiots? - Is everything okay? - All is well. I'll just take Ruby out for a walk. - It's okay. Let her go. - Hey, this is Spencer. I can't make him on the phone right now. - Shelly. Shelly! Oh god. - Are you okay? What is going on? - Just close, close the door. Close it quickly. They may be following me. Oh fuck. - Shit. Is this about Spencer? Shit! Did he find out? Jo, please tell me you didn't tell him. - Tell him what? - Tell him what? Were you too drunk to remember, or was it just that insignificant? - I thought that was a dream. It was not a dream? - A dream? Should I be taking that as a compliment? I texted you and texted you, and then I baked you a loaf cake and I leave you a card, and you just completely ghosted me. - I'm sorry, I didn't- - And it's like, you know what, I get it, because I'm married. I don't wanna blow up my life over this, either. But you're French. I thought we could be French about it. Like, what's the big fucking deal? Fuck! I'm just in a really, like, vulnerable place right now with my sexuality and my femininity, and I feel like fucking shit all the time, and you doing that to me makes me feel even worse, and I don't even have anyone I can talk to about how I'm feeling right now. - I do really wanna talk about this. I really apologize. But I need to make a quick, quick phone call. - Seriously? Just be quiet, because my baby's asleep. - Hey, this is Spencer. I can't make it to the phone right now, so leave your message after the beep. - Hey, it's me. I need to talk to you. R- Ruby is in danger. I am in danger. Please just, just send everyone away, and let us talk. Can I see? - No. - What's your secret? - Just your instincts. - There were no babies. There were never any babies. ♪ Your little girl, your little girl ♪ What are you doing in there? - Nothing. Nothing, I just... Just give me my baby. - Oh my god, she's so perfect. She's really just a perfect little angel, Jo. - Why did you come up to me that first day at the baby store? - What are you talking about? - I was a good target, huh? Clearly had no idea what I was in for. Now, you give her back to me. - Jo, let's be honest. She's ruining your life. - Give her back to me. - No. No. - Give her back to me. - No. And you have to be careful. You don't wanna break her. - Give me my baby. - No! - Give me- Ow, shit! She fucking bit me! - Good job, Ruby. Good job. You did it. We did it. I won't let them take you. Are you okay? - I'm okay, for now. - Yeah? Okay, thank God. I was so worried. - We don't have much time. - Okay, that's okay. I was so worried, I thought that you- - They want Ruby. - Who wants her. - They want, they want her, I don't know what for. - Okay, I don't understand. - I can't explain you, but you have to trust me. - Okay, okay. Who wants Ruby? - You're still wearing your apron? - Yeah, well, your message said you were in danger, so I came as fast as I could. And she's okay, so no more sneaking around where you don't belong. Stay here. I'm gonna go upstairs and get cleaned up. You're gonna stay right here, and then, when I come back down, we can talk, okay, mm-hmm? You gonna be okay? - Yes, sure. - Good. Stay here. Oh! I'm sorry, Jo. I'm so sorry to barge in. I drove all the way home and realized that I forgot my keys. Are you all right? - No, I'm, uh, I'm fine. I'm fine. I was, uh, I was just about to make dinner. - Oh, good, I'm starved. Here, I'll watch her. Here. Come on, little on. Come to Googoo. Oh! Hi. She's getting so big. She's getting such a big girl. Oh. - This is the best bolognese I have ever had. - Yeah, well, you'll have to give her the recipe. - Oh, it's pretty simple. All you have to do is throw yourself into it. - Jo, we, uh, we need to talk. - You don't like it? - You need a rest. A longer rest. - Maybe a few weeks away. Some professional help. There's medications you can take and, uh, yeah, Ruby will be fine. Mom's offered to help. - It's true that I, I've been really struggling and I, I didn't realize, nobody helps mothers in this country. - We're gonna get you the help you need. - Professionals are coming. They're on their way now to meet you and take you- - Without Ruby? - You said it yourself. Ruby's in danger. So they're gonna take you to a place you can rest. We'll bring all your things. - Can I... Can I at least say goodbye to her? - Of course. - Ruby, say goodbye to Mommy. Say bye to Mommy. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. Don't move! Just don't. You think you can get rid of me so easily? You want me to believe that I'm crazy, but I know what you're doing. I know the truth. I know. A mother's instincts never lie. How could you? How could you do this to us? Your own daughter. I hate you. I don't know what this is. I don't know what you want her for. But I promise this, you will never have her. I will never, never let her go. Never. Shit. - Jo, open the door! Open the fucking door! Jo, open the door! Open the door! Jo! Come on, come on! Don't fucking do this, Jo! Jo, open the door! Come on, come on! Don't fucking do this, Jo! Stop the fucking car, Jo! Stop, stop the fucking car! Stop! Jo! Come on! Stop the car. Come on! Jo! - Shh. It's okay, Ruby. It's, it's okay. It's okay, Ruby. Shh. Shh. It's okay, Ruby. Shh. ♪ La la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la la, la la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la la, la la la la la ♪ We're okay. We're okay. Ruby? Where is Ruby? Ruby. Ruby? Where is Ruby? - She's okay. She's okay. You just get well now, okay? - I thought... - I know. - I thought she was... I thought that you were, you were n- not... I don't know anymore. - Shh. You just rest up, okay? - The visions, psychotic episodes? - Gone. Auditory hallucinations? The crying in your head? - No. - Paranoia? Conspiracy theories? - I think we're gonna go to the park. We can all go to the park. - Monsters? - Only me. It all seemed so real. - It is real. Postpartum is real. And it's not your fault. - And if they come back? The visions? - I know you're afraid. Just take it moment by moment. You get through the first night, and then the next, and then it gets easier. - Ready. - Okay. I'll get this. Wait till you see Ruby. She's scooting across the floor on her little bum bum. And no words yet, but she's just babbling away. And finally, she is sleeping through the night, which was such a relief, obviously. - Thanks. - For what? - Ruby. I, I don't know what we would've done without you. - It's nothing. - My mother died; I was, I was only a baby. - I know. - So I couldn't call you Mom. And I still can't. - It's okay. It's okay. - Go ahead. It's all right. - Uh, I have to go unpack. - Ruby should go through the night. - I'll spend some time with her in the morning. - She loves you. - How? After all I've done? - You're her mother. You know, when the police arrived at the scene of the accident, you were barely conscious. Car was crushed. Nobody knows how, but somehow, you managed to crawl out of your seat. You crawled back to Ruby. And when they found you, you were covering her, protecting her. - I'm scared. - Then... Let's just get through tonight. - Hey. I'm coming, Ruby. - Ruby. - Everything's gonna be okay. Shh. Shh. It's okay, Ruby. It's okay, Ruby. All right. Shh. All right. Shh. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. That's what you wanted. Just give me one minute to make your bottle. Yeah, it will just be a minute, Ruby. Everything is gonna be okay, Ruby. ♪ La la la, la la la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la, la la la la la ♪ Please, Ruby. Please. You can do this. Yeah, Ruby can be patient. Yeah. Shut up, Ruby! You just stop your crying. You stop fucking crying! Make it stop. Hey! Hey! Ruby! Hey! Hey! Stop! Ruby! Ruby! No! No! No! You can't have her. You're a terrible mother. She doesn't want you as her mother. - I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid. I'm not. Come here. Come.
