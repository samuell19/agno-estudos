This is for the rice water! ZATOICHI AT LARGE What does it say? “Zatoichi, though blind, is a master swordsman.” The reward for reporting him is 20 ryo. Let's find this guy. Why would such a famous swordsman visit a remote place like this? Don't chase after easy money. Just stick to your steady job. MASTER SWORDSMAN REPORT IMMEDIATELY He has survived in this world Circumstances seem to reverse suddenly He must continue to prove his innocence Listen carefully. Listen carefully. Pick the cup with this black pebble and your winnings will double. Pay attention now. Round and round they go. The odds are one in three. Double your winnings. I was watching carefully. I think it's this one. You can't take it back. Do it now. - Hey, think hard. - Give me a second. This went here. Then this moved over here. - No, this went over here. - No, it didn't. Then this moved here. - This one here - - Hold it right there. All you two keep saying is this one and that one. You two are hopeless. Let me play. - But... - Are you sure? Just leave it to me. Win for us. - Lift up this one! - The bet is in. This one. - I got it! No, I didn't. - That's too bad. That was a quick loss. Listen up, I'll try it again. Pay attention, everybody. Here I go. Switcheroo. Which one now? This is not easy. Can you tell me which one? Why would he tell you? Just go on your hunch. What? But you're blind. Can't a blind man play? I'm not saying you can't play. But this game requires you to watch very carefully. So don't. For your own good. I may not be able to see, but I have excellent hearing. So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me play. Let's see. So I double my money, correct? Okay then, I'll pay you double what you put in. You can't play by watching. Close your eyes and use your ears. I'll play as a blind man, too. Am I playing a good blind man? What happened to the cup? Stay away from that blind man. Young man, you must pay me what I've won. Hold on. Are you a local here? You got that right. Do you know a Sataro who lives in this town? Sataro? He lives here. Where is he now? He's the son of the sake brewer. Can you take a look at this baby boy? Does this baby look like Sataro? Sataro is the father of this baby. You must be kidding me. This can't be Sataro's baby. I'm certain that he is. I'd appreciate it if you'd take me to him. If you insist so much, I guess I could take you to him. Promise me you won't get mad. Good boy. We're finally here. This is Sataro. Hello. It's my pleasure to meet you. I'll explain the details later. Why don't you hold this baby first? I understand your surprise. But this is undoubtedly your son. Hey, he peed on me. See, I told you. A kid can't be a father. That's why I didn't believe you. That's right. You're blind. - What did you say? - Now what? That's why I told you not to get mad. What do you want? Hey, wait. He tricked me because I'm blind. What a bastard. Are you looking for this towel? Yes. Thank you very much. Are you an official on duty? I'm just an old and useless deputy. Is that so? I can't believe how he treated you. Young men these days. I hope you can forgive him. Of course. I'm used to being tricked by pranksters in strange towns. But I'd love to know what his parents think about their son. I'm his father. That fool is my son. Oh, I see... Was Sataro once a yakuza? That's only hearsay. I heard he started a family in Bushu Kumagai. Why would he send a pregnant wife on a trip? I don't know what would make him do that. Some pesky sand got in here. I also got a pesky kid that keeps following me. This clay is useless. Does Sataro have any family living in this town? What? His family. His younger sister, Oyae, works at an inn at the edge of town. Is that so? Excuse me, mister. What do you think I should do with this baby? That's not my problem. It could be fate. Why don't you adopt him and raise him? You must be joking. I can't do such a thing. What's the name of the inn at the edge of town? Aburaya. Oh, I see. The sand must have been carried in on the wind. Sorry? I said Aburaya. Oh, yes. I see. Thank you for your help. I have no choice but to deal with this problem. I've never even met my brother's wife. How can I be sure this is his son? I'm not sure what to do. Take a good look at his face. Look at his cute face. He looks just like Sataro. It's incredible how much they look alike. How can you say that? You can't tell. He's still just a baby. Come on, don't cry. I'll make sure she adopts you. Look at him crying. Please take him. You can't force him on me. I'm working here. You'll be okay. Don't cry. I feel bad for you. I know you won't be happy as long as you're in my arms. What a poor baby. No one wants to hold you. It's not a big deal fo watch a baby. But so suddenly... Please help me. Only until my brother returns. As you know, we can barely feed ourselves. Well, then... How nice of you. You don't have to worry about this baby. We have eight children already. One more wouldn't make much difference. Right, Dear? Thank you very much. I never expected anything like this. I'm sorry about how I acted. I even contemplated just leaving the baby and running away. My brother's away on business. He'll return by the end of the month. Well... Yes? Why didn't he return with his wife? Now that I've gotten myself involved in this matter, I'll stay in town and do some work until Sataro returns. Then why don't you stay at our inn? Don't worry about the cost. I'll talk to the owner. I'm not sure if I should take you up on your offer. Why did you do that, boy? That hurts. You're bleeding! I don't know why I have to get pelted like this. Do you know that this town has no yakuza? Do you know that this town has no yakuza? That's unusual these days. True. Why is that? Why are there no yakuza here? Let me explain. There's a deputy called Tobei. He chased them away. Ever since then, there have been no threats or extortions in this town. What a great town this is! Bird in the cage Bird in the cage Out of the way! It's Tetsugoro of Narukami! What's he doing here? I'm worried about the festival. This can't be happening. What are you doing? No! Listen! This place is a brothel starting today. Go find some customers. I'll teach you all forty-eight positions. I'll show you how to handle the customers. I beg you, Boss. I promise to pay the debt. Please leave the store alone. I'm begging you, please. Fool. This way. Here's the guy. So you're the son of Tobei, the deputy. Answer me! I am. Thank you for this. Is your old man well? Yes, he's doing well. Your old man is quite a guy. He chased away that Kurobane family that used to rule this town. But he was much younger then. What do you need from my father? I need to talk to him. Tell him Tetsugoro of Narukami wants to see him. You're done now. Leave. Yes, sir. There's no rush. Enjoy your drink. Hey, leave now. No, drink. Time to leave! You bastard! Watch where you're going! Out of my way! You fool. When did you become a yakuza's underling? But you know who Tetsugoro of Narukami is, right? He'd kill me if I said no. I rushed over here because I was worried about you. How foolish can you be? You're a deputy"s son. Not a yakuza's underling. But Dad, you don't have much time. It's been a while. I'm here to talk to you today. I came all the way from Yaita. But he's a bit busy... Come over here. Just leave us alone. Damn it. I won't accept your request. That's not the answer I want. You know, I'm Tetsugoro of Narukami after all. This may not be enough at your age... but I'm willing to pay 50 ryo. You can't have my constable's hook even if you pay me 100 or 200 ryo. Even if I agree to it, you can't do anything without official approval. You don't have to worry about that. I've already taken care of it. All I need now is your okay. Then everything stays safe and sound. That may be true for you, but not for me. That's why I'm asking you about it. I'll make sure you'll be safe. Are you listening? How many times do I have to tell you? Deputy Tobei of Shiobara won't ever let go of the constable's hook. Is that all you have to say? If there's nothing else, I want you all to leave now. I've got things to do. Who do you think you are? Ouch! That hurts... Come with me. Hurry. No, you're hurting me. - Come! - Please, don't! You're Oshige, daughter of Niemon, farmer in Akamatsu village. Yes. The debt was for five ryo, but it's way past due. Hey. Show me your backside. You're tickling me. Boss. Give her a bath and keep her in the back. Oyae, daughter of Kyubei, farmer of Sunaga village. Her father died this year. She works as a maid at an inn. - How much was the loan? - 20 ryo including interest. The loan term is until the end of the year. Please give me one more day. My brother will be back with the money. Do you promise that? Yes, I promise. You know what will happen... if you don't bring the money. Yes, sir... Boss, we got all of them here. Listen up, everyone. Narukami's boss has reluctantly agreed to watch your bad performances. Do a good job and please him. You over there. You start. Go ahead. Do a good job. Let's start with the scene where Chief Chuji descends Mount Akagi. Come on, go down Mount Akagi. After killing a corrupt magistrate, he was chased to Mount Akagi. Let's drink the sake of farewell. What a beautiful moon tonight. When the moon hides behind the clouds... that's when the descent starts. - Asataro. - Yes, chief. Wherever he wants to go or whenever he wants to leave... he continues his journey while being chased. Chuiji! Oh, no! What's happening? Unfortunately, Chuiji collapses. Then Chuji carries the young boy down. Chuiji, do your thing! - That wasn't bad. - Thank you. You'll make about three shu during the festival. I want to make at least that. And ten percent would be 100 mon. So much? I'm very grateful. - No, you pay us. - Excuse me? Hold on, I do the performance and then I pay you? If you don't like it, we won't let you perform. Are you going to pay us or not? Okay, I'll pay you. This isn't fair. - Thank you. - Hello, everyone. - Do a good job. - You don't have to tell me. We"ll dance for you. Miss Otemo Weren't you married just recently Hey, young man, come closer. Let me show you something good. - What are you doing? - I was just... What's this “Let me show you something good?” What's wrong with it? Men like that. You better get serious, or else... His face turned red with anger. He looked down on the Takumi no Kami. He kept going straight, moving forward. He reached the pine tree by the river in Kozuke province. Without the slightest hesitation, he sliced through his opponent. His hat was sliced. Stop. You're annoying. If you make three shu in three days, it'd be 100 mon. What? That's not fair! You all turn in half of what you make during the festival to the boss. It's okay if you don't like it. But just know that we won't let you do any business. If I give you half, I won't have enough to get food for my monkey. You know, this is my monkey. And he's from a good monkey family. You're asking the impossible. You hear what I'm saying? We've got grandparents at home. - We have kids, too. - Are you all yakuza? What you're asking is not fair at all. What's that? Forget it. Okay, you can have whatever you want. What are you doing to us? I won't allow any injustice in Shiobara. This is no place for an old man like you. Tetsugoro, stop your silly act or I'll make sure you're punished. Who the hell are you? As you can see, I'm a blind masseur. You're not wanted here. Hello, Boss. I've got something I want to show you. - So you're blind. - Yes, I am. I'm not interested in seeing a massage by a blind masseur. You heard him. Leave now. Looks like you're more than just a masseur. Tell me what you can do. Are you going to dance naked? Let me show you. Can I ask one of you to insert a short sword here? Like this? Or how about this? - No, actually... - Or like this? No, into the floor. But we like it better here. What? You! Ouch! Young men, how about you all dance naked for us? What do you say, Boss? You shouldn't be so greedy. What are you talking about? The festival only comes once a year. Why don't you let the villagers make some money? Okay, I hear you. I'll let you do it your way. Everyone, I have good news. The boss gave us his approval. Make as much money as you can. Why do I have to remind you all the time? You're no good. I'm sorry to bother you so late. I came to see the baby. The young lady came and took the baby with her. Oyae took the baby? Oyae, is that you? He just fell asleep. I'm coming down there. He fell asleep in your arms. That's proof you have blood ties. I sense you're worried about something. If my brother doesn't return with 20 ryo... 20 ryo? I wanted my father to recover from his illness. I borrowed one ryo from a friend in Yaita. Somehow Tetsugoro got hold of the deed. It's gone up to 20 ryo. But I couldn't save my father. So I wrote to my brother. I received his response promising he'd deliver the money. But the payment is due tomorrow. If the money doesn't arrive, I'll have to work there. You must not do that. You'd be sleeping with multiple men every night. Not only your body will be ruined, but your soul will die, too. I may not see things, but I have keen senses. So I can sense how pure you are. What if you end up getting some disease? Your purity will be utterly spoiled. But I don't think you need to worry at all. I know your brother will return with the money. Did we wake you up, boy? Ichi, breakfast is ‒ Okay. Brother. Oyae. Sorry it took me a while. I know you've been through a lot. I let Oshino head this way before me. I didn't want to delay the payment if anything were to happen to me. About Oshino... She gave birth to a baby. What? Did the baby come already? Is it a boy or a girl? It's a boy. But... Tell me what happened. Did anything happen to Oshino? You must tell me. During her journey, she gave birth and passed away. Are you saying Oshino is dead? That man brought the baby here. I'd like to thank you for your kindness. I just happened to be passing by when it happened. I don't deserve gratitude. Oyae, I'm happy for you. I hope you got that 20 ryo. 20 ryo? I promised to sign on in battle for that money. I gave the money to Oshino thinking I might be in danger. So you don't have it. No, I don't. I don't believe it. I gave that money to Oshino. Kenta! Dad! - Kenta. - Dad. He's my son. Was he traveling with Oshino? Mom said her stomach hurt. So I went to find a doctor. I couldn't find a doctor so I finally gave up. So I went back to where Mom was... and saw she was killed by that masseur. Did you say she was killed? Are you sure you saw that? After he killed her, he searched her body. Stop. I thanked you for the baby. But I haven't thanked you for killing my wife and stealing 20 ryo. 20 ryo? My son saw the whole thing. Murderer! Now tell me where you hid the money. I didn't kill your wife. And I didn't steal 20 ryo. This must be a mistake. If you didn't do it, why are you running away? I'm not running away from anything. But that boy... Don't. Sataro, you mustn't be hasty. Don't pull it out. That's right. Keep it that way. I had nothing to do with 20 ryo. But I'll help you get the money. What did you say? I can't let Oyae be ruined. After I get that money, you and I will have a face-to-face discussion. I never thought doing a good deed for someone... would end up making me a demon. As you requested, I brought all the masters here. As you requested, I brought all the masters here. Moron. What an arrogant jerk to take the whole wallet. Count the money. I apologize. We've heard so much about you, Boss. We're pleased to make your acquaintance. Thank you for your service. Thank you. For you. Thank you for coming. Isn't this enough for you? I heard a rumor about that blind guy, Zatoichi. Apparently, he's quite skillful. You may have 20 or 30 unskilled men here. I wonder if they can take him down. - What did you say? - Say that again! Are you all hard of hearing? I wonder if 20 or 30 unskilled men could take him down. I'm as good as 50 men. I want 50 ryo. Just do what he says. Give him 50 ryo. Yes, sir. What's wrong with getting paid as an informant? When did you turn into such a selfish soul? Selfish? Dad, I think you're the one who has changed. As a deputy, why don't you arrest that guy? Don't you remember what I always tell you? I only use my weapon to protect people. I don't refuse any criminals, even if that person may be Zatoichi. But that masseur hasn't done anything wrong in this town. Thanks to him, we can have our festival. There's no reason for me to arrest him. I may be a humble deputy in this town. But I also have my own principles. You must pursue what you believe in. A man must stake his life on his beliefs. That's what a man does? I don't care what you think. It may suit you, but what about me? How am I supposed to live if you die? You know I'm not like you. You and I have nothing in common. Are you ready? The dice are in. Hello, I'm here to play with you people. Let him be. Let me get some chips. Okay. Thank you. I got them. Thank you. Let's get started. Are you ready? - Even. - Odd. Place your bets. Anybody else? All the chips are out. Match. One and One. Even. Luck was on my side. Thank you so much. Match. Two and Five. Odd. Thank you again. I appreciate it. Thank you everyone. Okay, let's play again. Miss, I'm blind. What you're doing is wasted on me. - Odd. - Even. Hold on. The dice sound different this time. Miss. Show me the dice we used before. Say something. If you don't show them, I'll help you get them out. See? You must have been very hungry. But you should eat something else. Not these dice. Do you need something from me? You impress me. I've never met anyone with such fine-honed timing and skill. I guess I could be a skillful blind man. I want a sword fight with the most skilled of swordsmen. That's what I live for. Please accept a battle with me. You shouldn't be so reckless. I don't know how much you're being paid to kill me. But killing me won't even get you a medal. I hope you'll just forget about it. I'm not asking you do it now. But just know I will not give up on having a battle with you. You bastard! Let me go! Why did you lie to them that I killed your mother? It's not a lie. I saw it happen. Mom was covered in blood. But that's what happens at childbirth. You murderer! Young boy? Hey, thanks for the commotion at the gambling house. - Finish him! - You! Murderer! You're a murderer! Damn you! See what happens when you stir up things? Let's take him to the Boss. - Get up, you moron. - Come on, get up! Get up now! Take him. You fool. Hurry up. Move. Come on, walk faster. You bastard. You bastard. Watch your step. Stupid bastard. Look at him. Zatoichi is just like a cat or a dog now. Hey, blind man. What will we do with this guy? Hey, say something. How about “meow” or “woof”? Meow... Now bark like a dog. Come on, bark like a dog. Say “woof,” you damn fool. Come on. This way. No, this way. Now over here. Bastard. Do that again. Damn you. Have you had enough yet? Get up now. Wait a second. Hey, Ichi. Wanna have some fun? Oh, yeah. That's good. Move over this way. How unfortunate. He can't even see to enjoy this. What's wrong now? This spectacle was too much for him. You're right. Get up. This guy's quite resilient. You bastard. Look at his face. Excuse me... May I have a glass of water? May I please? He's asking for water. There you go. Hey, you. - Thank you. - Here. Come and get it. Hey, blind man. Did that hurt? Sorry about that. I'm going to turn you in at Otawara so I can collect the reward. You'll just have to wait until then. You're looking pretty bad now. It's time for a drink. Excuse me. What? I'm sorry to trouble you. But I have this horrible itch on my nose. Can you... Can you scratch it for me? I'll scratch it for you. Give me your nose. There you go. Thank you. Where is Zatoichi? Where are you hiding Zatoichi? I told you I don't know. Come see the Boss. - I don't know anything. - Shut up! - No. - Come. Good evening. Master, are you here? - Who is it? - Well... What happened to you? I don't know my way around here so I fell down the hill. Get inside now. Thank you so much. Are you all right? I'm fine. It's not that bad. Master, I need to bother you for a moment. There's something I need to show you. Let me get it out. This thing here. Please take a look at this thing. What is this? That's supposed to be me. What do you want me to do with this? You're in the business of arresting fugitives. I'm counting on you to do your job. I've heard that Zatoichi is a fugitive. A fugitive's description usually comes from high up. I've been a deputy for 30 years. I've never seen or heard of a fugitive who shows up... with his own wanted notice. Then I must be the first to do so. Even though you tell me you're a fugitive, I can't just accept what you tell me and arrest you. Master, please believe me. Don't be so difficult. Just go ahead and arrest me. I Know you can't see. That's right. The drawing doesn't look like you at all. Doesn't this look like me? The drawing is much better looking than you. Why do you actually want to become a fugitive? I'm desperately in need of money. Money? This wanted notice says... the reward for being an informant is 20 ryo. I want to inform on myself. Inform on yourself. What's that 20 ryo for? If I don't pay that amount, Oyae will have to sell herself to Tetsugoro. The payment deadline is today. Are you going to risk your own life and limb to help Oyae? There's no comparison between Oyae and myself. Silk sandals versus worn-out wooden ones. I have nothing to lose. I have 20 ryo right here. Just take it. Wow. Is this my reward for being an informant? You're paying it to me in advance. Thank you very much. This was the money I was going to leave... to my son, Seiji, when I die. But I'm moved by your generosity. So you can just keep it. I've been all over and visited many places. But I've never met a person like you. I will borrow this money from you. Ichi. Go give it to her now. A deputy protecting a blind man. That's not even funny as a joke What are you talking about? If you're not going to catch the fugitive, Zatoichi, I'll arrest him. Give me your constable's hook. It says he's in his mid-30's and blind. Appearance: his height is average... with a strong build. Are you here to start a fight with me? Welcome back, Boss. Boss, there's blood on you. It's from an old man who kept order in this village. I didn't expect that much blood from him. Boss, Sataro is here. Your brother, Sataro, is here. Hey, get my change of clothes ready. Show him the deed. Yes, Sir. You'll get Oyae back as promised. Here it is. I hope you didn't come empty-handed. I'm here to ask for your understanding. I promise to return the money. So please let my sister, Oyae, go. I'm begging you, please. I'm no fool! What now? I see you're smarter than I thought. You care for your sister that much. I've made up my mind. I respect your affection for her and I'll write off the debt. Then you will let Oyae go. Thank you so much. I will never forget your kindness. Thank you very much. Don't worry about it. By the way, Sataro... I have just now granted your request. Yes. Then you must grant my request. How can I help you? It's nothing special. I just want you to kill one blind guy. A blind guy? You shouldn't have any complaints with Zatoichi as your opponent. What do you say? Don't you like it? He wants his sister back but he won't pay the debt. And on top of that, he won't accept my request. He's just treating me like dirt. Why is it so dark in here? Hey, Dad. Are you asleep already? You hit me for the first time in my life. I was actually happy. Wake up. Look, I got something you like. Get up, now. Hey, Dad. Come on, wake up. Dad? Dad! Who did this to him? Dad! Zatoichi did this... Wait up, Sataro. Are you sure you can kill him on your own? Someone's coming. Bastard! Damn you. You tricked me. Dad! Kenta... Dad! Kenta. Get that towel. That's Mom's. Then it wasn't Ichi who killed her. You have a pretty face. But your body isn't ready yet. It's not the New Year yet, but why don't I get started? Hey, you. Who said you could come in here? Hello, Boss. Here's the 20 ryo she owes you. How nice of you to bring it all the way here. Boss, before you receive that money, we need to clear up some business. Please call your men here. If you don't, I'll slice your arm off your shoulder. Hey, someone, come here. Come... Someone, come here. Young boy, show your face. Young boy, if you see the man you know, show him that towel. Oh, that's... Ichi, Tobei was killed. You killed Tobei. Hey, Tetsugoro. You owe them the incense money for Tobei and Sataro. That's 200 ryo. Did you say 200 ryo? That's a drop in a bucket compared to your funeral expenses. Go get the money. Now! Now give me the deed. Is this the correct one? Get him. Get out of my way! I'll get him. Bastard. Why do you do it It is never for your own good Letting your conscience guide your actions Letting your conscience guide your actions Don't let Ichi get away. Letting your conscience guide your actions Here it happens again Revenge for my father! What is the action to take There are always ups and downs This is for my father! There are always ups and downs Don't you get in my way. Wait! What do you think you're doing? Kill him! For my father's sake! Ichi didn't kill your father. It was Tetsugoro! Believe me. It's the truth! It's the truth. Auntie! - Gonroku. - Yes. Shohashi, you go, too! Go now! I'm going in. Wait! Hold on! Don't come this way! Zatoichi. I'll kill you for my Dad's sake. You're wrong. You're mistaken. Don't come near me. Zatoichi is mine! Wait! You must hurry and leave. Go through the bamboo forest and straight to the Kinugawa River. Are you letting me go? My Dad used to tell me. “This constable's hook is used to protect people.” Hurry up, now. Ichi. Unlike me who's been alone all my life without knowing my own birthday, you're lucky to have such a kind lady named Oyae. Oyae, I have a request for you. Make sure to celebrate his birthdays. Ichi... Young boy. I want you to grow up to be a respectable man... who can walk under the sun with confidence. Continue on the journey Accompanied by the blowing wind And the drifting clouds The black raven at large remains unfazed He goes wherever and whenever he pleases His only trusted companion Is his walking cane THE END
