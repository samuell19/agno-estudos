sir, it's been a long time I used to work for you I have something to tell you your name is kasuke, is that right? How do you do? What is it you want to tell me? Do you know a samurai named heizaburo sasao? Heizaburo sasao he tried to kill you but killed his father by mistake do you remember? There was a massacre last night he did it many kitamae ronin are being assassinated do you know why? Well... I have two demands to help solve the mystery demands? A woman who bears a grudge against gomyo I know it because I happen to live with her are you boasting about her? The other is... the fact that I was the only person there when heizaburo killed his father heizaburo it's you asakusa hannyain temple what his father said at that time is worth a hundred pieces of gold we'll talk about it some other time will you come to my house? Wait no thanks let's contact one another like this kamesen, a teahouse by a river teahouse by a river? It's deserted. Nobody's there called kamesen? Satisfied now? The tattooed one I've been waiting for a man like you that is all, it's everything I have you 're worth a hundred gold coins think so? I know where he is he 's in gomyo's place kill him when he sneaks out rest assured oriwa thanks for your help I read the books you lent me and... they included a travel diary so what? Mr yataro are you sure you don't remember anything? But it's strange I can read this picture, doesn't it help? Doesn't it remind you of anything? This sound this tinkle oriwa ezo kitamae clan, does those words help? Who are you? You know something? Oriwa heizaburo heizaburo you do know something, oriwa heizaburo you're heizaburo I don't know tell me who's he? Tell me hannyain temple in asakusa hannyain temple in asakusa go there you will know the whole story yataro tanigawa I've got to get rid of him at any cost why don't you call him heizaburo sasao he was a kitamae samurai just before his clan was abolished he and his wife were attacked they 're both missing now they were attacked by your men you don't have to explain any more that's one of our rules right? It's useless to try to hide anything now it happened two years ago the kitamae was abolished the only way to save the clan was through kanemaru heizaburo sasao the little lord's guardian, try to stop the abolishment by using him our lord went insane and kill himself we may well be punished but abolishing our clan is too much we must prevent it little lord kanemaru should be our new head will you appeal to lord tanma for us? I dissuaded him he finally gave up and went home on his way, the crest on the lantern caused him to mistaken for me, he was assassinated and the assassin was heizaburo, his son he is now yataro tanigawa he killed his own father? Strange fate with zenzaemon dead, there was no way to save kitamae clan whatever he said to heizaburo when he was dying we must know what it was or my dream may be ruined my dream about ezo, why not join in? Why not make up your mind? What do you think gomyo lotus blossoms sometimes grow even in mud but it was no meaning to me now gomyo I can't answer right now what? Our work involves gratitude is that what you mean? It embodies both gratitude and a sense of duty it consists of something that money alone cannot satisfy are you saying need time? Another thing what happened? She tried to kill herself don't worry about it get a doctor will you wait? Not too long I'll give you until midnight very well midnight tonight see you the places: Here gomyo bring heziburo here by midnight understand? If you bring the promise I suppose you know what'll happen don't worry, no one in the organization ever has regrets if anything happens to me remember your promise midnight midnight, gomyo he hasn't recovered enough to go out any ideas about where he is? He said "family temple" he was trying to visit it, right? I know, hannyain temple in asakusa gomyo that's it, he must have gone there you still look like when you were a child your eyes, your mouth. They remind me of how you were 20 years ago you are heizaburo, the one who kill your father will you take oriwa to kamesen? Oriwa no, I hate to part with you listen, there's something I must do I'll go as soon as I finish something is about to happen you go first and wait no don't' complain no oriwa no that's too much shut up don't interfere oriwa, I'll help you settle down got it?

The money you earned and saved for yourselves distribute it as your wish wait, boss boss shut up, I'm not your boss no gratitude, no duty forget about it and think about yourselves understand? Your father entrusted me before he left edo he said to give it to you when time came it contains the charter signed by tokugawa ieyasu giving ezo to the kitamae clan the government cannot ignore it thus your father requested me to give this to you priest in fact what you are saying, what is it all to me? Your father died trying to save the clan observe his will that's what you must do why must I be the one to do it? Man cannot abandon his past as long as he lives listen, heizaburo running will ruin you stake your life on reviving the kitamae clan I don't know look, heizaburo the fate of the clan sis at stake I don't know heizaburo that sort of thing has no meaning to me it's you?
