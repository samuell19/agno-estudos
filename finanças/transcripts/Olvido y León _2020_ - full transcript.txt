IN MEMORY OF JACOBO ECHEVERRÍA TOVAR You're gorgeous. Really gorgeous. Really gorgeous. Really gorgeous. Shame about your boyfriend. - Are you all right, Dido? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Thanks. Yes. Careful. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Come. WELCOME TO OUR WEDDING OLVIDO AND LEO Change partners! Change partners! Come. Where's Dido? She's a lazybones. - Shall I go and look for her? - No, she's on her way. What do you want? A bit of everything. When are we going to those islands? To Hawaii. The day after tomorrow. And then? ONE YEAR BEFORE Close your lovely eyes, my dear Close your lovely eyes, my love Open your lovely eyes, my dear Open your lovely eyes, my love Open your lovely eyes, my darling Both your lovely eyes, my love You've got some benefits for your care. We did have, for my sister to look after me, but it's often me who has to look after her. Has she tried to commit suicide again? It was an accident. You think so? It was an accident. A mistake. She wanted to cure herself quicker, and she took more tablets. Sometimes she's tired and gets distracted. Has she had more accidents? No. León, I'm only here to help you. To help her and to help you. We get along just fine, but if you give us those benefits again… Did they take them away? Not only from us. There was a crisis. Everything I ask you is to help you. Olvido has tried to abandon you again. No, she never abandoned me. Has she hurt you lately? No. Even without meaning to. I hurt her not long ago without meaning to. I stepped on her foot. There's never any kind of violence at home? No. León, your sister needs help, and if you don't talk, I won't be able to help her. She's got me. If you don't let anyone help you… - You can get us back on benefits. - Sure. Have you requested a helper for when your sister goes back to work? We're fed up of asking. I'll fill out the form for you. Then your sister has to sign it. We might be in luck. I doubt it, if we were, we would've realized by now. All right. It's time to get back to normal, and avoid any more accidents. Your sister... My sister is great! Want a sweet? Yes, thanks. So, do you have anything to tell me? About what? You got fired from the petrol station and you've got no job… Something like that? I made lunch! The boss blew a gasket. I told you he didn't like me. Why did he blow a gasket? I don't know. He hates me! Why did he go mad? Why did he kick you out? How do you know? Why do you know? The association called me. As well as getting mad, he's a grass! The boss told me: first, I had to take the cap off the tank to insert the hose and put petrol in. Secondly, I had to… take the pipe out and put the cap back on. And? I took the cap off pro-per-ly and put petrol in. And I told the man it was ready, but I forgot to take the hose out! You told him to go without removing the hose? The car went off, the hose sprang out and covered everything in petrol. My boss got really angry and threw some papers on the floor. He shouted at me like a madman, like a maniac! I'm not surprised. It wasn't such a big deal, he said a couple of things to me, I was only 50% wrong. What's wrong? I wanted to swipe the air without touching you, but I only got it 50% right. Hey. Clean up 100%. Yes, but only my share. How will I convince the association to find you another job? I'll go on the dole. I'm already on the dole and my benefit ends within three months. It's not my fault! I'm not the one to blame. It's not my fault. I know. It's the politicians, they don't do a fucking thing for people. How can they when they're always on telly? Is the association open tomorrow? But Amparo doesn't go in on Saturdays. I'll speak to her on Monday. But if I get you another job and you let me down, I'm off to Canada and you won't see me again! You said Australia the other day! Well now I'm off to Canada. I found something just for me. Forget about going out with friends. And don't use your mobile for the internet. No more money spent until some is coming in. Like in Spain? What are you like! What are you looking at? Nothing, it was open. Get out. Out! Shall I come in to give you the paper? Clear off! You haven't wiped your ass! Do you want to wipe it? If you want. Fuck! Everything has its price! They're angry with me. It must be something you've done. I didn't do anything to them. Perhaps that's why. You women are all mad. I'll never be going to get married! Nobody loves me! Somebody must. There must be someone crazy for you. There's at least one mad woman for every idiot man. There's none for me. Who do you like most? Me? Scarlett Johansson. From the ones you go around with, stupid. None, but if one showed any sign, that would do me fine. What's for dinner? Have you tried the clothes on? They're a dead man's clothes. They're from your friend Kiko. He's not my friend anymore. He's dead. What's this? Let's see… It's heavy. I don't like it. I won't wear it! Wait. - Open your mouth. - No. I don't smoke! Give it here. Let's see… - It's too big. - We can sort that out. Right, hold it here. Put your arm out. Perfect. I love it! There are shoes too. They're big! We'll leave the shoes and keep the clothes. What's for dinner? Get a mortadella sandwich. There's none left. I had it for a snack. Pass me my bag. What do you want? Don't even think about opening it. Bring it. How nice of you! - Where did you nick it from? - Hey. Hey! When does the series start? It's already started. - Has it? - Yes. - Have you been on yet? - No. When do you have another audition? Now! - I must go. - It's you! My wife has arrived. Shit role. He overacts. - Does he really kiss you? - What crap. Is that all you're in? I obviously didn't kiss her cunt enough. Don't you have to lick the director's? In the series that… They took out the only fucking sentence I had. What did you say? You won't get famous with tiny roles like that. Don't hit yourself! Don't hit yourself! You can also die of success. We are telling people, the politicians, that they must be responsible and they must protect the future, the future of current generations. I don't have a future. You're like me, then. COP 25 is taking place right now. What's that about? What? That you don't have a future. - It's what my boss says. - Your ex-boss. For me, the future is rubbish. What will I do in the future? I was never in the future. …hope is out here with you all. The future is for pigs. In Spain and in many parts of Europe many people see the future as a threat. I want to change that future for a future of opportunities. Don't let evil defeat you. You can change this society and everything you propose. Don't be afraid of the future! Dare to dream big dreams! I invite you today to that big dream. Your youth enables you to… I told you at the beginning that we are not living in easy times, but I also believe that we must simply have the firm conviction in ourselves and in Spain, we have always got ahead when we have faced the future responsibly, magnanimously and rigorously, with determination, reflection and serenity. We won't get lucky if we never play the EuroMillions. My big prize would be for you to get married and clear off and social services or your in-laws would get you a flat. That's all I think about. We'd have a room for you, but you won't bring anyone. In a married couple's home, there are rules. But sometimes you could sleep with us. I'm never going to be free of you. Not even in your dreams. I can't go on like this! I need love! I've got love to give and receive! I've got a lot of love to receive. I've got a lot of love to receive too. I just melt thinking about love. It makes me shiver, it gives me goose bumps, goose bumps all over. Quiet, you'll make me randy. Can't we just be a little lucky? I already am. May I? What's wrong? It's Friday… Are you going out on the town? No. But I'd like to sleep with you. No fucking way. Why not? Just no. Come on. I don't like sleeping alone on Fridays. I said no. Can I put the mattress on the floor, with the sleeping bag? No. Put it in the corridor. Not in my room. It's cold in the corridor! Put it in your room and that's that. We were getting on well a minute ago! What a time to call! Don't answer! It can't be good news. Hello? How's it going? Now? At the hourly weekend rate? Okay. I don't know, three quarters of an hour at most. Half an hour. Okay. See you then. I told you not to answer! - I told you, didn't I? - Shit. Maybe you were in the middle of a beautiful dream. Now what? Fucking hell. What? I'm going to serve drinks. Someone has to bring some money in. Guess who. Has a job come up? For tonight. If they find out… They'll stop your dole. You'll freeze to death! Either I'll freeze to death or we'll die of hunger. And don't wake me up tomorrow. Turn the light off! Please. I won't wait up for her. Don't forget the agreement or the objectives. What are they? For today. Find work and a girlfriend. Don't forget that. If you don't do it, I'm off. I can't take it anymore. It's enough for me for you to get 50%. A job? That's good enough for me. But you have to get both things. I'll give you two weeks. You understand it's no joke, right? - Of course. - I hope so. Bye! Bye! Give us a side view. Now the other. Good. Say your lines, please. Here… Read out the reply. Okay. Of course, I want to go. I want to see the house you live in, those windows that look onto the cemetery. I want to see your furniture, your books, your daughters, your wife. Of course, I want to see your wife's face, to know what the silences between you are like, to see that smile. To know about what you don't tell me when we're alone. What's that woman got that matters so much to you? Yes. Don't get jealous. There's no reason for you to get jealous. I'm not jealous. How could I be when I know that you grow younger by my side? It's enough to see how you come to me and how you are transformed with me. I know why you come back to me, when you look at me, when you undress me, when you fuck me. Good. Very good. There's a nude scene. Would you mind undressing for a second? - Sorry? - I need to see you naked. Fine. If you need to, you'll see me naked. But don't film me. - What? - Don't film me naked. - But it's just for us. - No. Can I take some photos? No, no way. I have to assess all of you girls within a few days. Don't worry, you won't forget about me. Dido! How did it go? Get your panties off! Did I need to wear panties? - Fuck you! - Bye. Bye, thanks. How's it going? - Late again? - How did it go? It wasn't a test just for me and four others. It was a test for bloody everyone. We know there's a lot of competition. A lot? A whole town! It looks like a call for extras. All of us there as if it were a meat market. When it's your turn, they put a stamp on your ass. And you, chatting away on your mobile. Olvido, I work for other people. You're not the only one who wants to be an actress. I don't want to be an actress. I am an actress! I want to work as an actress. Look, there have been worse times. Call the director and invite him out for a coffee. I just got his number. Don't think I wasn't working for you. Call him and tell him he can get to know you better. They like people paying attention to them and asking them things. Tell him a few general things and he'll agree with you. Or he'll make a point. - He'll want to thrust his point into me. - Perhaps. - Fancy a drink? - If you're paying. Alright. No eviction! No! No eviction! No! No eviction! No! No eviction! No! No eviction! No! - The Ramos family! - They're staying! - The Ramos family! - They're staying! - The Ramos family! - They're staying! - The Ramos family! - They're staying! - The Ramos family! - They're staying! Silvia is a waitress in a restaurant. She's been there seven months and they're very happy with her. I know how to make fried eggs. Alfonso is in the supermarket as an assistant. He's been there a year and has had no problems. Anita has been a receptionist at a hospital, for five months. She's adding and removing everyone's data on the computer. And Kiko has died. Poor old Kiko has died. Nobody is born knowing everything. You have to make an effort. I have to bring a wage home. The wage is enough for you. You don't really need the work. Quique and Lole got married. Do they live on their own? Lole's parents gave them a flat, they are working and we send someone to help with the house. That's why I want a job, to get married. Lole liked me. You can't let opportunities slip by. How's your sister doing? She's on the dole, looking for work. Sometimes she works as an actress or… as a waitress. Right. Olvido wants to speak with you, but I preferred to come, because… She's got enough on her plate. She can come when she wants to. How does she treat you? Well, very well. Has she tried to hurt you recently? No, the complete opposite. What do you mean? She loves me, she helps me, she gives me advice. She treats me well, she's my sister! Has she hurt herself again? No. Has she got a boyfriend? Does she bring guys home? I don't talk about anyone's life, let alone my sister's. That's fine, you're right. I'm just worried about you. Do you want to speak with the psychologist? No. I want a job I can do. Right, we'll see what we can find for you. And let's see how you behave. I'll do it as best as I can. If they could give me an advance… Will you stay on a bit at the association? Is Elenita here? Or Marta? They were, but they must be about to leave if they haven't left already. Elenita! What time did we arrange to meet? I had to speak to the director. She was quite late. And before, I had to walk a dog. You're the one who's a dog. Elenita… We've just started going out. Well we're finished now. Why? What's with you and Marta? Which Marta? How many Martas are you dating? I've left her for you! Well now you haven't got either of us! Why? I invited you to hot chocolate and churros the other day. And you really liked it. You kissed me! That's over now and we're quits. I've got no money, but they're going to get me a job. We can go out together. I'm not interested in you as a boyfriend, and don't even think about bothering me again. Hi, Marta, what a coincidence. I don't think so. No, I wanted to speak to you, to see you. Well, you've seen me now and there's nothing to talk about. - I know about you and Elenita. - I'm not with Elenita. Because she sent you packing. She just sent me a WhatsApp telling me everything. But I've got back with you. Well clear off and don't come back. I'm nobody's second choice, especially someone who wears a dead man's clothes. Get out of here or I'll make a scene. What a temper. I'll never get married. She'll get over it. - Are you single? Separated? - Bye. I do dog walking! It's not for lack of trying! How did it go? Bloody awful. And you? So-so. But it's only Monday. Shall I go? Or would you like to? Who is it? Who is it? Hello. Are your parents in? We're orphans. Oh dear, I'm sorry. Thanks. My father drowned in the Atlantic Ocean and my mother died after a long illness. I'm sorry. Who do you live with? With my sister. We're twins. Right. And who lives with you? No one. Do you want to speak to my sister? Come in. My sister is eating. I'll let her know you're here. Don't you live with anyone? No. Me and my sister. I'm the one at the bottom. Is that your twin sister? Yes. By luck, she's not the one with the syndrome. I'll call her now. Who are you? - Hello. Leonardo... - What are you doing here? - I'm... - Why have you let him in? He asked after Mum and Dad. I told him we're orphans. Leonardo Saldaña. I'm the new landlord. The owner of the flat. The owner of this whole block of flats. All of them? And Rosendo's flat too? What do you want? We're up to date with payments. I wanted to make you an offer. I'm doing it with all the tenants. What's wrong with your hand? Nothing, I got burnt. - Why? - Put cold water on it. I can dress the wound for you. That's it. Is it too tight? You're very handy. Yes. A year in Afghanistan with the army. There I had to tend to wounds… And real bloodbaths. Since then, I'm always prepared. Did you kill anyone? Well, that's the offer. I can lease the building for other things. I want to get it ready for tourist accommodation. Three tenants have accepted. - You want to kick us out. - I can't. I wouldn't make you an offer otherwise. You have a contract for five years. I'll pay you to leave now. And what's the offer? I'll pay you a year's rent if you leave. You'll pay us a year's rent? Brilliant! I don't know if we want that. You'd have a flat paid for a year. No rent to pay for a year. It's a good offer. That's really great! I won't find another flat for rent at this price. And with a long-term contract without paying a deposit. You've got a while to think about it. And if I don't accept? It's your decision. You're the prettiest thing I've ever seen. She isn't a thing, she's a feminist! I'll come to see you every day and try to persuade you to change your mind. Are you trying to get off? No! He wants to make a deal. - Yeah, get married to me. - What? I'm being serious. You've only just met her! I'll leave you my card. I won't accept a "no", so don't reply. When you've got a "yes", call me. Even if it takes weeks. Even if it takes years. I'll be waiting. And if I'm with someone else, I'll get rid of her. I withdraw the offer. - Which one? - You're withdrawing it? I withdraw the rent offer. So I'll know where you are. Don't harass me. I'm not a stalker. You're invited to dinner. Call me, tell me tonight… Or tomorrow. Or for lunch, or for a trip out. I'm at your disposal. Except for two and a half months from the day after tomorrow. Why? I'm going away. To Punta Cana, New York… Want to come? You're having a laugh. You know I'm not. What's the downside, apart from what's on show? I give and demand loyalty. I collect firearms, I'm boring, I've got money, I like travelling. The loyalty and firearms… Do they go together? I don't know. If there's no offer for the flat, we're done. No guns are allowed in here! That's that, then. - Bye. - Bye! And your behavior? He wanted to get off. We've lost out on an offer. Nobody ever made me an offer before! I can always marry him. No way. I have to get married first. Punta Cana, New York. Los Angeles. He didn't say Los Angeles! And he's ugly! I love ugly, boring men with money and loads of weapons to kill me. He didn't say Los Angeles! Marta. I have to talk to you. Say what you have to say and clear off. Be quick, we're in a hurry. - Just the two of us. - They're my friends. They can hear what you have to say to me. - I want you to be my girlfriend. - I was. It's over. It's over, León. Marta goes out with other people now. Who? - Who? - Casual things. I don't accept that. I'll pull my hair out! I want to marry you! No! Come on! Hey! Asians! Subsidized Asians! Subsidized Asians! South or "Nolth Koleans"? Ah, no, Chinese! "Suprenacists!" Marta! I won't accept a "no". Come back when you have a "yes". - Who is it? - Hello, I'm León. Is Elenita there? She's gone out. I'm sorry, León. I don't know where she's gone or when she'll be back. Goodbye. What are you doing here? I bought you this ice cream. That's the kind you like. Yes. I want to talk to you. What about? To say sorry, and to go out with you. My parents don't want me to go out with you. Why? What do I care? But you like me! No! You told me you liked me. I say a lot of things when talking for talking's sake. You're not a liar. You're not like the others. I know. You're mega gorgeous! Am I prettier than your sister? No? Well then, go with her, let that whore put up with you! Elenita! You said it! My sister isn't a whore! Did you hear me? Come in. Any news for me? Hello, León. Not yet, but we're working on it. Come in, and we'll talk while you help me. No thanks. I'll be back. The fight is feminist or nothing! The fight is feminist or nothing! The fight is feminist or nothing! The fight is feminist or nothing! We're the voice of the disappeared women! We're the voice of the disappeared women! We're the voice of the disappeared women! The fight is feminist or nothing! Olvido! Hello, Camilo. I'm sorry. Arriving late is easy, right? It's hard work looking for work. I know, girl. Tell me about it. Look, there's no queue today. It's not extras for a series, but main roles for a film! - Bloody hell! - Yes. They've only invited you and three others. They've seen your video books and now the director needs to meet you. - Is the director here? - Yes. What's his name? Fuck, it's on the tip of my tongue. I don't remember now, but don't worry. I don't know what they'll make you do. We've no script. Have you prepared a small text? I've got tons of small texts prepared. Yes, come on! This could be the big one. The film will get made no matter what. - Is it here? - Yes. Go up. Hey! Good luck. Hello. Olvido. Of course, I want to go. I want to see that house you live in, those windows that look onto the cemetery. I want to see your furniture, your books, your daughters, your wife. Of course, I want to see your wife's face, to know what the silences between you are like, to see that smile. To know about what you don't tell me when we're alone. What has that woman got that matters so much to you? Don't get jealous. There's no reason for you to get jealous. I'm not jealous. How could I be when I know that you grow younger by my side? It's enough to see how you come to me and how you are transformed with me. I know why you come back to me, when you look at me, when you undress me, when you fuck me… - Good night. - Good night. - Bye. - Bye. - See you. - Bye. Don't forget about the eggs. Do you like it? It's a bit salty. Would you like some paprika? Some paprika? It's salty, not tasteless. But you like paprika. I don't want any. I think I do this recipe quite well. You could be a bit more flattering. Elenita's mother says you're a whore. Why's that? I don't know. Have you been bothering Elenita? Not anymore. I'm not interested in her. Tell her mother that I'm not a whore. I don't charge, I fuck for free. Is it only whores who charge? Of course. Elenita lets you touch her tits for two ice creams. Then, she's a whore. Today I only had money for one ice cream. Do you remember Mum? She said not to stick the knife into the bread. I don't remember Mum. You haven't finished. Don't you want any more? Don't hit yourself. Don't! It's a pity you're not in the series. It's really popular. Don't you want to watch it? What about this? Do you prefer a romantic film? Put whatever you like on. Watch the TV! We're together at home watching it! Watch the TV! You have to watch it! …choose between the past and the future between the old and the new, we are proud of representing the future of our country. Did you hear that? He said "future". …with my father, we are proud of our parents, of our grandparents. They brought most of the social progress in our country. We want to live up to that to build… What about this? Do you like it? Shall I leave it on? Shall I? Dido? Dido! Dido? Dido? Dido! Do you want me to sleep with you? Dido? Shall I sleep with you? No! It just can't be It just can't be That no one Truly loves me That no one Truly loves me That no one Truly loves me That no one It just can't be It just can't be That no one Truly loves me Dido? Dido? Dido! Dido! Help! Dido. Dido. Are you awake? Do you want to talk? It's León. Do you want to talk with me? We're alone. Wake up. Good morning! Olvido, I'm Conchita. Do you remember me? I'll leave you my card again and if you need anything at all, call me. Any time, okay? - Hello, León. - Hello. - How are you? - I've been better. Olvido, when you're a little better, you decide if you want to simply go home or if you want to ask for help… A neurologist, a psychologist, someone to talk to, to help or monitor you. You have to be offered that. But it's up to you. I recommend... I'm going home. As you wish, Olvido, but it's my duty to advise you to see a psychologist. It won't be for long. They're not too generous here. She's going home. Aren't you afraid that she needs special help and you can't give it to her? Don't you think that maybe Olvido needs to rest? She can rest at home. Maybe she needs to rest from you. I don't want a psychologist. You don't have to decide right now. I have to monitor you. - For you, for León… - Nobody has to monitor me. You mustn't avoid talking about the suicide attempt. It's very important. You've tried before. It's good that it's not a taboo. Speak with León, with your friends. With whoever. Suicide. Ghosts are scared of the word. Suicide. Suicide. "In 2014, every day ten people took their own lives in Spain, ten people each day, a lower rate than in other European countries." Europeans kill themselves a lot more, huh? "In Spain, three times more men commit suicide than women, but there are many failed suicides amongst women." Just as well. You've got to admit that in some things you women are clumsier. "In Spain, in 2011, for every 100,000 inhabitants, 11.6 committed suicide." Where did you get that tablet? Leonardo gave it to me. - Leonardo who? - Our landlord. The one who wants to marry you and won't accept "no" for an answer. He brought those flowers. That's why it smells so nice. "For every 100,000 inhabitants, 11.6 committed suicide." How can 0.6 commit suicide? Are you the ones who don't commit suicide properly? Oh, no! "There are less suicides in Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Italy and the United Kingdom. The highest suicide rates are in Lithuania, Hungary, Latvia and Belgium." They don't play football there, or they're no good at it. Right. And I don't play either. "Suicide in Spain is the highest cause of external death amongst men, with a rate of 12.9 deaths for… for every 100,000 inhabitants, followed by traffic accidents and accidental falls, both with 6.3 deaths." It's impossible for 6.3 to die. Either six die or seven die. Why don't you go out for a bit? León, I've got five euros here on the table. Why not go out and have a drink, on me? And leave you on your own? Yes, please. You'll find this interesting: "The month with the highest suicides is June." They don't say why. I don't understand it, the year starts in January. Why are you laughing? Statistics are no good, not even for wrapping up fish. Pass me one. Good heavens! Oh, my Lord! It's the Archangel Gabriel! More flowers! Olvido, do you accept Leonardo as your husband, will you be a faithful companion, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health? I do. Leonardo, do you accept Olvido as your lawful wife and will you be a faithful companion, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health? Yes, until death do us part. By the authority conferred upon me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - Hooray for the happy couple! - Hooray! What are we going to do in Hawaii? Swim, walk… Just like here. We can go surfing, horse riding… - Have you brought your guns? - No. - Good morning. - Good morning. How lovely! It's delicious. Sit down. No, I'll have a shower first. - Not even a coffee? - No. White. I'll be right back. We were better off in the hotel! What? What's wrong? She's gone. She was there, sat down. I saw her from above. She stopped reading and climbed onto the track. I was watching her, she dived in and didn't come out. She grabbed her skirt like that, lifted it up, and she went in head first. I don't know if she died outright or if she drowned afterwards. She dived in from above. I saw her. She couldn't cope with the weight of the world and there was no one to help her cope. Why don't we go back to the hotel? I'll pick you up in half an hour. You'll have time to see the pretty chapel. Or shall we wait here in the hotel? Then we're going to eat at "The Miracle of Fear". What a name! So many emotions! She wanted to fly. What? - The girl wanted to fly. - On the water? The chapel is on the other side! We have to wait in the hotel! We have to wait there! Where are you going? We'll get lost! It's your husband. Answer the phone! Don't. You'll never know when they call you! It's Leonardo. Now he's calling me. What shall I do? I bet you someone will fall. It must be lunchtime. Now we had a future! Do you think it doesn't bother me having to go back and go to that Hawaii? - Look. - Yes. You could see it coming. Come on, let's go back to the hotel. Leonardo must be worried. Come on! Thanks. Thanks, gorgeous. - Are you all in the same group? - More or less. You, whose hand has bathed My back in transparent fire Whose eyes in clear shipwrecks Sank some of the greatest convictions Of my soul You are my country I cannot tell whether you Without a surname Are bird or perch Lead letters from all your arms Have fallen, one by one Like hollow nuts You You are my parents And my country You, not even you remember where You hung out the white clouds to air So many loves Make you confuse the name Of every day of every week You You are my God And my parents And my country You, who kiss so sweetly That the sky fell flat on its face And nobody knew from whom The tongue from whom the saliva So delicious and temperate You You are my laws And my God And my parents And my country You, who graze on skulls In the meadows of green Africa And feed the red lions On milk roses From the Nuruquimagua moon You You are my army And my laws And my God And my parents And my country You are my army and my laws And my God and my parents And my country And the army and God and the laws And all the countries and parents Believe that you are nothing That you are nothing
