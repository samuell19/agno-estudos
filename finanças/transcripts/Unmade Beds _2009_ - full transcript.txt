Well, no, I was going to, but I had a bit of a problem with the plane, so I couldn't jump. What the fuck? -Frankie's head. -How many people live here? No idea. Changes all the time.

Do you remember... getting your willy out in the middle of the street? No. -What?! -No, I'm just messing with you. Actually, you and Hannah passed out. I stayed up checking out your dad's name online. -Hannah, you want some breakfast? -I can't, I'm really late. -Mmm. -Bye. There's one, two, three Anthony Hemmings... That one's in London.

It's the third time you asked me. It's... It's 12:15. Thanks. Hey, what happened with your dad? Did you go back to his place? There is never anyone there. -Well... -Maybe he's on holidays. Have you spoken to the neighbors? No. Well, maybe you should. They'll probably know where he is. You paint like a French painter. -Do you not like? -I love it. -[Axl laughs] Really? -Yeah. Thanks. Do you know that jacket that is in the kitchen? Which one? What, that stripey one? -Yeah. -Yeah, what about it? -Is it yours? -No. Do you think it's a suit jacket? What do you mean? I mean, do you think it's the kind of jacket that a businessman would wear? No, it's a school uniform. -Really? -It's a cool Polaroid, though. -I think so. -Yeah, it's a school uniform. -That's a good image for a poster. -Let me see. I'll tell you what: I'm gonna keep this Polaroid, you keep the jacket; if anyone claims it, give it back to them. Okay. -I look older. -Okay, it's a school uniform. Look, that's some school's logo. [engine humming] -Do you mind if I smoke? -No. -Do you want one? -Yeah. Thanks. And that's the nearest tube station. It's about 15 minutes' walk from the flat. So, Anthony-- can I call you Anthony? -Yeah, sure. -Have you worked in this business for a long time? -About six years. -And before that, what did you do? Oh, um... different things. -Why do you ask? -I'm just curious. Have you always lived in London? No, no, no, I was, I was abroad for a few years. -Whereabout? -Oh, you know, different places. Uh, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Thailand. Thailand was nice. Spain. -I like Spain. -Yeah, me too. Have you... meet with many girls? [chuckles] I was with a girlfriend when I was young, -I was with someone at the time. -Spanish girlfriend? Yeah. -[door closes] -[Anthony] Right, one bed, studio apartment. We've got two or three in this block and... they're very popular. There's actually no one in the flat at the moment, it's empty, but, um, it's fully furnished, ready for you to move in whenever you want. How old are you, Anthony? -Forty-three. -Really? I thought you were older. And you get the sun here right through the afternoons. -It's nice and bright. -Are you married? Hmm? Uh, yes. Got any kids? [chuckles] -You ask a lot of questions. -I'm sorry. Two, actually. Two daughters. One's three and the other one's six years old. So, what do you reckon? -About what? -The flat. Oh... -I don't like it. -No? It's too white for me. -Too white? -Yeah. Sorry. [scanner beeps] Are you sure about this book? Um... -Yup. -Unlock the Heart: The Key to a World of... Everlasting Bliss. -Bliss, yeah. -Yeah, it's... I don't think I'd buy something with that title, it's... I shouldn't be saying this. Actually, um... Do you know what? I'm gonna leave it and just have a think about it. I mean, it, it's not for me anyway, it's, um, just... -Okay. -Yup, bye, cheers. -Have a nice day. -Yeah, bye. -[clicks] -It's broken. Keeps printing the wrong price. [rattles, clicks] -Hi! -Hi! [chuckles] Hi. [chuckles] Wow. Wow. Cool. -Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. [chuckles] [Vera] I'm sorry I left like that without saying goodbye or... actually anything. Was a bit rude. You had to catch a plane. -Yeah, right! -[chuckles] When I woke up, you were gone. I thought it was all a dream... 'cause I realized we never, we never actually said something about each other's lives for real. -I didn't even find out your name. -That's funny. I've been thinking about that too. I quite liked it. I still don't know your name. [both laughing] Oh... Gross! I don't know. I'm sorry, this isn't good practice. -Forget it, all right? -[laughs] I just have... I'm just having this strange feeling like I'm a teenager again. [indistinct chatter] It's a good feeling, though... This teenage feeling. [music and chatter stop] [clattering in distance] [kissing and panting] [panting] [scooter passes in distance] Hi. -You didn't disappear. -[chuckles] -Can still run away. -Don't. [kisses] -[snaps fingers] -Wow. X-ray man style. I wonder how long we can stay like this. Like, without knowing each other's name? [laughs] Without knowing anything. Let's find out. [X-ray man] When am I gonna see you again? [Vera] You have to say when, and I say where. [X-ray man] Saturday morning. -[Vera] Okay. -[camera clicks and whirs] [X-ray man] So you say where. [Vera] Um... the Broadway market. [X-ray man] All right, but the market is crowded, so you have to say somewhere specific. Well... the morning is long. [traffic passing] [Mike] Why would you want to pay rent? Nobody pays rent. It's a squat. [Axl] Yeah, I know, but, but... What do you think of this one? -I don't like. No. -You don't like? That one? They're all pretty dirty. What do you think of this one? I think it's the best one. Yeah, me too. -Yeah? -Yeah. Yeah, it's the bigger one. Yeah, so, I don't know, maybe I could help you in the bar or something. What, you need to find a job? No, but it could be like an exchange. I don't pay any rent here and I can help you out at work. -[Mike] Go, go, go, go! -[grunting] -[Mike] Go. Come on! -[Axl chuckles] I'm not very good, let's swap. -What... why? -Let's swap. What, you think that side's harder to carry? -Yeah, I think it's... oh. -All right. But you know what? You forgot to bless the mattress. Right, you gotta go... [kisses] I bless you, mattress. [kisses] Please give me good sex. [kisses] Please give me good sleep. [kisses] -Just make sure you do that, all right? -[laughs] -You'll be sleeping and fucking... -Ah!

[Vera] Me too. Actually, I've been here for hours. [chuckles] What do you feel like doing now? Maybe something, like, something I've never done before. -11:14, that's the next train. -That one? -All right, let's see where this one takes us. -[Vera laughs] [bell ringing] [X-ray man] Do you have any secrets? [Vera] Yeah, of course. Why? [X-ray man] Um, have you ever told anyone about them? [Vera] Mm, no, they're... They're secret. [both chuckle] -[birds squawking] -[waves lapping] [X-ray man] Why don't you tell me one of your secrets, and I'll tell you one of mine. -'Cause if they're so, so secret... -[chuckles] ...then it's almost like... as if they're not part of our lives. -[Vera] Mm. -All right? [Vera] I used to have an imaginary boyfriend. [X-ray man laughs] Uh-huh? [Vera] I told all my friends that I had this boyfriend called, uh, Malik. And every Monday at school I would say I spent all weekend with, you know, my boyfriend Malik. [both laugh] [Vera] I don't even know where I took that name from. -He was very good-looking. -Yeah? [Vera chuckles] Of course. I even dreamt of him a few times. [both laugh] [Vera] He just felt so real. [X-ray man] So what happened to Malik? [Vera] At some point I said to everyone that he moved away. -[X-ray man] Mm-hmm. -And that was it. After that, he was gone. [X-ray man] I used to do magic tricks when I was eight or nine, and one day I made my best friend believe that I could make myself disappear. [Vera laughs] [X-ray man] You know, I was just hiding in a, in a secret corner of my closet. -[Vera] Well done. -But his problem was, of course, that he didn't know how to make me appear again. So he, after a while he completely panicked, and he didn't dare to tell my mom. And he was just crying and praying to God... -Oh, my gosh. -...to bring me back. [X-ray man] And then eventually he... I think he fell asleep or something, so I came out of the closet and laid down on the bed next to him. And in the middle of the night, he woke up, and he was so happy to see me, and he hugged me, and I told him that he made me come back in his dreams. [chuckles] [X-ray man] When will I see you again?

[lighter clicking] Do you know who gave me this lighter? Um... The rabbit? My father. [Mike] Are you gonna see him again? -Hi. -Hi. You all right? I just came here to tell you something. I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm not looking for a flat anymore. I'm staying at my friends' place and... I don't have to pay any rent there. Lucky you. I guess that's it then. Thanks for letting us know. Sure. -Did I, um... Did I give you my card? -I have it. -In case you need anything. -I got it. Yes, I got it. It's okay. Okay, then. You gave me a cigarette the other day and... I forgot to return the lighter. [chuckles] Um... I thought I'd left it somewhere else. Thanks. Actually, you-- you know what? You can keep this one... if you want. Take care.
