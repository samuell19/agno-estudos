The elderly say that no one dies alone in this valley. Here, the tradition is to be accompanied on one's last journey to death. It is not an easy task. You always have to be available for that unexpected call. You have to know the path and what to do with who resists the inevitable. That is why I came to these mountains to learn the secret job of death to learn it from you, Armugan. The last end-of-life doula. Let's go. Better don't. Good night. Good night. She finally rests in peace. Life always mocks us... It makes you mistake the end with the beginning. It makes you mistake everything in decadence like this body, with the eternity that is also "myself" but doesn't belong to me. Now, when the senses collapse everything seems so clear. But suddenly, something keeps me here. I feel the breeze caressing my skin and the memories of those gentle days of witty life that I hold onto, come back to me. Close your eyes! Close your eyes, close your eyes, like this... imagine we are in the river, in the water, the water is very cold, and we are swimming, Armugan we are swimming, Armugan swimming, swimming, swimming, right? Isn't it? Come a little closer There are two things, that can't be contemplated without blinking, these are the sun and death. These are the sun and death. Sheep? There's a woman. Octavia? No, a foreigner. I need your help, to come with me. If you don't come with me, I will kill him. I don't kill. I know, that's why I'm here, I need you to help me. Go down to Boltana, ask for Octavia. I've talked with her But I cannot wait, he's suffering too much. It has to be today. Nobody knows, nobody will know. Good night, Julia. Hi. -How are you? How did it go? -It went well, yes, he was calm. I'm glad. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? Yes, I'm sure. Ok then, good night. Good night, many thanks. Come on in, come on in. Don't be scared. There's no one. Adri, Adri, my dear... he's here, the man I told you about. You can't? But why not? Look at him, help us. I can accompany him to death but I cannot take his life. But you can't leave him like that. That's no way to live. Please, please, please. If that kid could lift his hand, surely he would shoot himself. I don't know what I'm doing here. I know that people want to protect you. They know that if you help me, they will go after you and you won't be able to help others. The old ones, nobody misses them. But the kids suffer equally. Maybe more. A lot more. You forgot your hat. I'll come in to give it back to you. Life is so fragile and still it reproduces itself behind the glass, breathing through the cracks. Adri lived like that for over three years. He didn't get to know a different life. People feel sorry for me for having son who's ill. But I never stopped loving him, accepting his misfortune and mine as a fate to be embraced. Me being sure that he would approve all those attempts to keep him alive, all those tests, all those machines. That life that's not life. But one of those long wide-eyed nights, I felt he asked me to get close to him. I got closer, with a smile on my face. And he looked at me in the eyes and told me, life doesn't want me to be alive, it only wants for me to stay alive, he said so and of course, I had taken too long to realise that he hates me. He hates me and this life I enchained him to. I'm so selfish I keep crying to avoid losing him. I kept him attached to this world. I tied him to these machines. I feared losing him. I understand you. Look at me. Look at my body. That machine keeps him alive, doesn't let him go. I cannot disconnect it. Nobody can end life without pain, without hurting. I think we hurt more in this hopeless torture. Armugan is not going to disconnect him. He's got his primitive principles. In the end, he's not so different from those people who don't understand that death cures life. I can stop the torture. If your son asks me to. I can disconnect him. I won't let him suffer. Anchel! Anchel! Don't! No... you propose to face our fate by embracing life. To end this agony only with good intentions. There are two things that can't be contemplated without blinking, these are the sun and death. These are the sun and death. I can stop this torture I have heard them cursing God and life, begging to die. Adri, my dear, he's here, the man I told you about. Your mother asked me to come. She loves you very much. Are you tired? Yes. I see you love lions. They're strong, aren't they? Just like you. You are very strong. But now, it's time to rest. To stop suffering. You're going to stop feeling the pain and you're going to go somewhere else that I don't know about. Where do you imagine yourself going? To paradise to paradise... Paradise is nice. Now close your eyes, like this, think about paradise. Think about paradise. In the hospice where I grew up nobody wanted to make friends. We feared losing them. They kept moving us to hospitals. ?any of them never came back. Most days were sad and hopeless. Nevertheless, we all held onto our lives. One bright day, a remote possibility was enough to love life. Nothing seemed more fortunate than living a life that arises to disappear and come back in a different shape, like the river turns into fog. This job taught me that ending is just an illusion. I walked away from the world to stay close to the people, in that moment when love overcomes death. I have no secrets I wouldn't want to teach. Neither magic but I've seen that death is like the night it's not more than a defeated day and nothing can stop a new day fron coming. Armugan Life weights upon our bodies. The resignation of our tired feet moaning as they walk by. We bear a sun of ashes whilst life takes stock of it. I am humiliated for an unspoken word. You are swept away by a silent blow. He's deprived from lightness. I've waited for centuries to be able to rest, away from this resented weathering. How am I not to hate life? But if I lead you to death, it is because I love the living.
