There is an opinion that Judas had betrayed Jesus Christ in order to force him to declare his divinity and thus set off a vast rebellion against the yoke of Rome I think such act of Judas would be superfluous Jesus daily preached in the synagogue and performed miracles before gatherings of thousands. There was no need in the treachery of an apostle to identify a master This, nevertheless, occurred. Is it an error in Scripture? Or a single haphazard act in the most precious drama in the history of world No, there was no error. The treachery of Judas was not accidental. - Explain. - it was a predestined deed and it's linked with Redemption. The Word Jesus, when It was made flesh, passed from eternity into history from blessedness without limit to mutation and death A spoken word crucified Jesus. in order to correspond to such sacrifice it was necessary that a man a man, as representative of all men, made a suitable sacrifice. Judas Iscariot was that man. Judas, alone among the apostles, intuited the secret divinity and the terrible purpose of Jesus. But wait. Jesus did not need to make use of a man to redeem all men. He could count on the considerable resources which omnipotence offers. And we know nothing of the inexplicable traitor Only in gospel of John there said that he was a thief, was greedy and had a box with money. To impute his crime to cupidity? I don't think, this is too simple. Don't forget that he was an apostle. One of those chosen to announce the Kingdom of Heaven. To cure the sick, to cleanse the leprous, to resurrect the dead. That's why I'm sure that cupidity is not the cause. I propose another version of the treachery. An extravagant and even limitless asceticism. The ascetic, for greater glory of God, degrades and mortifies the flesh. Judas did the same with the spirit. He renounced honor, good, peace the Kingdom of Heaven. Pardon! Why didn't he renounce his renunciation? Why didn't this man renounce his renunciation? With a terrible lucidity he premeditated his offense. Almost all sins have dual nature. In adultery, there is usually tenderness. In murder, courage in blasphemy, a certain splendor. Judas elected those offenses unvisited by any virtues abuse of confidence and informing. He labored with gigantic humility He thought himself unworthy to be good. Judas sought Hell because the felicity of the Lord sufficed him. He thought that happiness, like good, is a divine attribute and not to be usurped by men. The water of the forest is still and felicitous, And we, we can be vicious and full of pain. It is a mere perversion or exacerbation of mind game. And nothing more. I haven't finished! The thing is that God lowered himself to be a man for the redemption of the human race. His sacrifice was perfect, not invalidated or attenuated by any omission. But this sacrifice played a very successful role. His 33-year being among us was some kind of a good rest. It won international recognition, thanks to typography. He just paid the price of the agony of one afternoon on the cross for all this fame. You mistake! The crucifying of God was not ceased, for anything which has happened once in time is repeated ceaselessly through all eternity. You think that Judas continues to receive the pieces of silver and to kiss Jesus? He continues to knot the hangman's noose on the field of blood? Sure. And the incarnate word of God that Jesus actually was it was a precise prophecy, not of one moment. ??? Have you said that Jesus is just a Word? Now listen to the most important. This is the third version of Judas' treachery. God became a man completely. And if he could feel tiredness, coldness, unrest, hunger and thirst, Then we should admit that he could sin and ruin his soul. God became a man completely, a man to the point of infamy, a man to the point of being reprehensible. In order to save us, He could have chosen any of the destinies which together weave the uncertain web of history He could have been Alexander, or Pythagoras, or Rurik, or Jesus. He chose an infamous destiny ??? But, my dear, if it is true, you've disclosed a terrible secret. A roman writer, Valerius Soranus, died for revealing the occult name of Rome. What infinite punishment would be yours for having discovered and divulged the terrible name of God? No! I refuse to listen to it! We've come to the edge of an abyss. Oh, this endless building! Everything is falling and crumbling. - I'm leaving to my estate. Let's go together! - No, you don't say so, I can't "The Guest" based on the story "The gospel according to St. Mark" by J.L. Borges. Director and screenwriter Alexander Kaidanovsky Holy Golden Age! When there were neither laws nor officials. And people respect justice by their own wish. They knew no fear, no punishment, no judgment They didn't read threatening sentences on brass plates. People lived peacefully without courts, knowing neither Christ, nor Antichrist, nor Judas, nor treachery, nor deuce knows what. All crimes were combined together on the basis of justice and trust. All this disappeared. Deceit, treachery, cunning and abuse came instead. The War came. A host didn't believe his guests any more. I'm not saying about you. Come here, help me! Lift it, damn! We've come. Be careful! Wash the staircase and wax it. Place the sculptures. Spread the carpets. Put up the paintings. And there should be no dust! You'll do it tomorrow morning. And now we must have a snack. Be quick! - Supper will be plentiful. - No, just show me my room. I have a terrible headache after this damned riding. I'd rather have a rest. Is it a goldfinch? Do you need something, sir? What's wrong? Do you feel bad? No, there's nothing to worry. You have a strange look. Haven't you recovered yet? - Haven't you heard about this street? - Never. Where is it? The street... Doesn't it remind you of something? No. Why do you ask? I have a silly feeling. A feeling or desire. In other words, I'm longing for places where I've never been and haven't been going to. Nonsense. You've overworked, my dear. You should have a rest. It's impossible to do that endless resitting of your damned examinations. - Sorry, how old are you? - 33 33! When will you find a job to your taste, at last? Please have a drink. I have to go to the neighbouring town. I've looked through commercial papers... My silly steward mixed everything up. I'll just finish the affair and will be back in a week I wanted to take you along but a journey makes you sick. There's no point to harass you. I warned the steward, so he'll treat you like the owner. Have a rest and do your exercises. By the way, about the steward. Have you seen his hovel? He's been living with his son and daughter for many years there. His wife several years ago... Take away damned tree from the table! His wife died several years ago. They are good-natured but very stupid. Once I asked the steward when he'd been born. He couldn't answer. Imagine, he knows neither date of his birth nor the name of his father. I have my own theory connected with it. I think that most village stories about ancient times were the result of bad memory and mixed dates. - Where are they from? - God knows. This steward has been working here since the beginning of the century. Sometimes they use words they don't know. If they had a language, they forgot it. And they haven't learnt ours. They never could write. They don't believe in God, don't have holidays. They live in filth and they're very superstitious. By the way, if you return to the house on a horse you must never gallop. It horrifies them. I don't know why. Now we may walk around - Do you ride a horse? - Yes, of course. Fine. Horses are ready. And remember: don't gallop, coming to the house. I can't believe that this all is mine. Go! The air here is beautiful. But apart from air, crowns and these endless trees there's nothing special. I'm not saying about women. When you packed clothes in the hotel, I noticed that you took a tailcoat. I assure you that you won't need it here. I didn't tell you in the hotel, not to scare you But here's no point to show off. Here are only these rams and pigs My steward has plenty of them. But nature, my friend, is a precious solitude which is so hard to reach. It is chaffinch. Bittern? Do they live here? Goldfinch. Brilliant voice. Why did you stop? Let's go! Your bath is ready, sir. You will do everything he ask. Do you understand me? Goodbye! Goodbye! Come here! ??? Drink! As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: ?Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way. A voice of one crying out in the desert: ?Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.? People of the whole Judean countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins. John was clothed in camel?s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. He fed on locusts and wild honey. And this is what he proclaimed: ?One mightier than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; he will baptize you with the holy Spirit Your tea, sir. Your tea, sir. Please, have a seat. Sir, read us the thing you read us yesterday. Yes, of course. And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him, not even with chains. For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him. And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones. And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him. And crying with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus the Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not. For he said unto him: Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit. And he asked him: What is thy name? And he saith to him: My name is Legion, for we are many. And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of the country. And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding. And the spirits besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, and were stifled in the sea. Bring a horse, please. I want to ride a bit. Yes, sir. Your tea, sir. Thank you. Please, have a seat. And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused him in many things. And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee. But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered. Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of prisoners, whomsoever they demanded. And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder. And they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them. And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews? For he knew that the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them. And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews? But they again cried out: Crucify him. And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him. And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. Name... I even don't know her name. Her name... Sir! Is it true, that Jesus died for redemption of human race? Yes, to save them from the Hell. And what is the Hell? It's the place under the ground, where souls will be burning in eternal flame. But those who crucified him will also be saved? Yes. Read us, how it finishes. And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews. And they struck his head with a reed, and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him. And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him. The water goes down. It is not long in coming. It is not long in coming. Give us your blessing, sir.
