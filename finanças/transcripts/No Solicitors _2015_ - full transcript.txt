(bouncy and playful orchestral music) (jogger panting) (wheels rattling on sidewalk) (bouncy and playful orchestral music) (motor sputtering) (bouncy and playful orchestral music) (jarring percussion accent over skittering electronics) - (gasps) Please, stop it (sobs)! Stop! (woman shrieking over menacing electronic accent) I'll do whatever you want, please! (shrill and menacing electronic accent) Please, stop (sobs), don't do this, please! (menacing electronic music) Why are you doing to me? Stop it, please! (shrill and menacing electronic accent) Please, please, please, please! I'll do anything! (fabric ripping) (sobs) Please, don't kill me! (swell of menacing electronic music) Let me go, please! I'll do anything you want, anything, anything! Please (screams)! (tense electronic music) (woman screaming over tense, menacing electronic music) (ominous ambient music) - [Lewis] Oh, Sam? It's unusual to have you stop by my office this early in the morning. - [Sam] I have some wonderful news for you. - And that might be? - I had a call from Medical Board. They have announced that they are honoring you as the foremost brain surgeon in the country. That means that you will be the recipient of the prestigious Mayflower Award. You know, this is just so good for the hospital. Yeah, well, that being said (sighs), congratulations, my friend. They couldn't have given it to a more deserving guy. - Thank you, Sam. (ominous ambient music) If you only knew. Thank you, Sam. (ominous ambient music) - [Ralph] And how long has she been missing? - Uh, I think about five days. - And how old is she? - 20. - What was she wearing the last time you saw her? - Um, jeans and her favorite T-shirt, but she loves to wear dresses. She's got a lotta clothes. - Is it normal for her to disappear like this for long periods of time? - No, uh, she never does this! Even her best friend doesn't know where she is, and I called the school and her work (sobs). - All right, do you have a photograph? - Yes. (dramatic piano and orchestration) - OK, Zukowski! - I went to her apartment, and the dog was unsated and thirsty, I'm just not-- - Why don't you take my card. If you hear anything from her, please don't hesitate to call. - OK. - Now, this officer will go ahead and show you out, arright? - Please, detective, whatever you can do, she's all we've got. - We're gonna do everything we can to find her, OK? - OK. - All right. (dramatic piano) - [Ralph] All right, that brings us to six missing persons in the last three months. - That's frustrating, and I don't see a pattern or a connection to any of these people, let alone any bodies showing up anywhere. - Yeah, it beats the shit outta me, too. Listen, Davenport, I want you to run cross-references on high schools, colleges, clubs, anything else you can think of that might, uh, make a connection with these people. - I'm on it, I'll also check with the hospitals, see if there's any John or Jane Does, as well as the coroner to see if there's any unidentified bodies. - Arright, sounds good. (sighs) Come on, people, talk to me! Help me find you. (muffled chatter over dramatic orchestral music) - [Doctor] I am so very sorry. (Sophia sobbing) - You know how much Annie loves Maria. She would give her own kidney if she could. It was a freak accident that both her kidneys got damaged. - Accident or not, if she had kept an eye on her, none of this would have happened. For God's sake, she's our only child (snivels), and if she doesn't get a kidney, she, she'll die. - So, Sophia, I've been making calls, searching the internet, contacting all my business associates throughout Europe. I've even checked the experimental possibilities. The hospital is doing everything it can. It's not like we can't afford it, and she's almost at the top of the waiting list! - (sobs) But David, she's only got two weeks! Listen, I don't care what it takes, you find a kidney for our baby girl (sobs). (dramatic electronic music with ominous undertones) - [Man On Left] Excuse me, I really don't mean to bother you. - What can I do for you? - [Man On Left] Actually, it's what I might be able to do for you. (tense electronic music) - One kidney, patient's name? All right, got it, there's a small rush fee. Once we verify the deposit, we'll have the kidney delivered. Arright. (phone clicks) - So? - Well, Sis, we have an order for one kidney. - Male or female? - (scoffs) Not that it matters, but it's for a female. - How much do we get? - 125K. - Holy shit (laughs), you're too much! - What, it's a rush order and keep your voice down! You don't want Mom to hear you cursing, do you? - She's gonna be so happy! Mom, I got some good news! - [Rachel] Oh, I'll be right there. - She's gonna lose her fucking cookies! - Stop, she's gonna hear you cursing! Why's she gonna lose her cookies? - She's got her eyes on a purse that costs three grand. (Scott gasps) That's why Dad can't freak out. - Good point, let's hope the donor and patient are a match type for the kidney. - I'm gonna call him. - OK. (dramatic piano and orchestral music) (Lewis sighs) - Hello? - Hey, Daddy, it's me. We have an order for a kidney, (Rachel gasps) but I guess you know that since you have a guy stationed near the hospital for needy patients. - OK, one kidney coming up after dinner. Is your mom home? - Yeah, hang on. - Hi, honey, how was your day? - Well, as my head nurse, you should be the first to know. I am being honored as the country's leading brain surgeon. - Oh, Lewis, that is fantastic, and you certainly deserve it. Think of all the lives you've saved. Congratulations, I think this calls for a celebration! How 'bout I make that special souffle for dinner tonight? - Sounds great, look, I have to make a stop on the way home, so I will see you in a little bit, OK? - Love you, OK. OK, kids, let's make this a special night for your father. I want everything to be perfect. In the meantime, could you please go check on our patients' meds, give them their sponge baths, and change those bandages. - Sure, Mom. - Thank you. - Oh, Mom? - Yes, baby? - Can I please practice my technique? (Rachel groans) - Come on, Mom, there's no salvos left, so she can't damage anything. - Come on, please, please, please, please? - I guess that'll be OK. You have assisted your father and I a lot. You kids go have fun. - Thank you. - OK, babies. (Nicole giggles with excitement) - We finally get to play doctor! - I know right (giggles), yeah. - [Scott] I'll race you. - Yeah, you OK? - [Scott] Yeah. - Let's go! (both panting and laughing) - Scott, unplug the machine, I'll just roll him into the next room. - OK. (Nicole panting) (medical equipment beeping over ominous electronic music) (monitor beeping rapidly) (sustained beeping tone from monitor) (ominous electronic music) Ready, Doctor? - Ready, Doctor. (flesh crunching over uneasy, throbbing electronic music) (saw whirring) (saw crunching through bone) - [Scott] OK, Nicole, we're ready to remove the brain. - All right, you are a very cool brother, mwah! (slaps pattering over tense, ominous electronic music) (laughs) All right. (scalpel crunching through brain tissue) (brain squishing over tense, ominous electronic music) (laughs) That is so rad! - All right, I need to grind the bones that I use in the garden. If you don't mind checking on our patients, I'll finish up here. - No, it'll be my pleasure. - All right. - I'll go pu this on ice. (tense and menacing electronic music) - [Ralph] So Davenport, anything come back with your search? - Not a thing, I have a few calls out to my friends at the bureau, maybe they'll come up with a connection. - (sighs) I'll be surprised if they do. This just feels local to me, and something about these people just doesn't fit. I mean, (sighs) did you check with their employers? - Yes, and they're not connected to any single company. - All right, let's go back to the families again. See if maybe they knew each other. Let's also check, uh, medical history. Maybe they had the same doctor, and, uh, let's get phone bills, credit card statements, you know, the usual shit, Jules. - This isn't my first barbecue, Ralph. - Eh, well, somebody's got a bone to pick. - Really? (lid snapping) - How's everyone feeling today? - Fuck you. (tense and menacing electronic music) (files slamming on counter) - [Nicole] What'd you just say? - I said, fuck you. You and your family are fucking crazy and sick! - Fuck me? (William groaning over menacing electronic accent) (William sobs) That kind of language is gonna cost ya something. (William groaning) (scalpel slicing through flesh) (William groaning over menacing electronic music) (William gurgling) (tongue crackling and cracking) (William whimpers) - Good job, Nicole. - Aw, the poor boy fainted from a little pain, and if any of you even thinks of telling my mother about me cursing, I'll cut your fucking tongue out just for the fun of it! - [Scott] All set, Sis? - Yeah, how 'bout you? - I'm hungry. - Yeah, me, too, I'll finish up their meds, and I'll meet you up there. - OK. (ominous and tense electronic music) - Now, as you know, we are a no-nonsense group that only focus on results. We do not limit you to specific territories, and we encourage door-to-door solicitations. Now, please review the envelopes in front of you about how to approach potential clients. - I have a question, Marvin. - Yes, Mindy, what can I do for you? - Well, since we don't have any specific territories, and you want us to get listings, how far can we go to get the listings? - Well, I'm not sure where that question is coming from. Can you be just a little bit more specific? - (laughs) What I mean is, do we bring cookies or can we flirt? - Well, Mindy, I suggest you discover what works best for you. If cookies doesn't do it and flirting gets you in the door, then I don't see anything wrong with that, but keep in mind you represent Sonic Realty, so be cautious not to cross the line! - Well, Marv, if neither approach works and some of my other ideas don't pan out, don't expect me to show up for work ever again. - And we should be so lucky. Well, Mindy, I know that you are resourceful, so please, just go out there and get 'em. - I have a few ideas to present that should knock 'em dead. (ominous electronic music) - OK, that's it everybody, everybody just have a great day. (envelope rustling) - OK, neighborhood. (finger thwacking on map) You're it, be ready for me, because here I come. I will not take no for an answer, so you might as well invite me in for my pitch (lips snapping). (Mindy laughs) Hello? Hi, honey, how are our honeymoon plans coming along? (Julie sighs) - I drew a blank with my guys at the bureau. - [Ralph] Uh-huh. - [Julie] What's weird is that each one of these victims have completely different jobs. - Well, there's gotta be something that connects these people, I mean, they didn't just vanish. - (scoffs) Maybe it was aliens. - (chuckles) You know, at this point, I would take that. All right, let's go back to the beginning. See if maybe we overlooked a link. - We've already checked a thousand times, and there doesn't seem to be any connection! - Look, I agree, just dig deeper, OK? Go back to the childhood, maybe they went to the same summer camp or something. - You're starting to sound like this is a revenge situation. - Listen, honestly, I don't have a fucking clue what's going on here, and until we find a body, we have to consider that these people are together. - Hey, what if they're planning a heist? (muffled office chatter) - Let me see if I understand this correctly. We have a political intern, a construction salesman, a cosmetics lady, a census taker, and a Bible thumper and, my favorite, the Girl Scout troop leader who sells cookies. My guess is that they probably all teamed up with your aliens to plan the heist, right? (scoffs) Yeah, that works. Hey, guys, hey, you know what? It's cool, we cracked the case, it's aliens. - And your ideas are so much better, Ralph. Oh, wait, you don't have any. (Julie speaking foreign language) (tense and dramatic strings) (doorbell rings) - No solicitors, we'll see about that! (Mindy clears her throat) (tense and dramatic strings and piano) - [Scott] May I help you? - (gasps) Why, yes, my name is Mindy, and I represent Sonic Realty. I noticed how beautiful your house is, and I was wondering if you would consider selling it. - [Rachel] Who's at the door? - It's a realtor wondering if we wanted to sell the house. - [Rachel] Can you handle it? - Yeah, I got it, Mom. Sorry about that. - As I was saying, your house is perfect for a few clients I have that are in the market. - I appreciate that, but I don't know how that stuff works. - Oh, I can show you how it all works. - So, what'd be the first step? - It would be helpful to see the house. - When would you like to see it? - Well, I have some time right now if you're free. - Hey, I have a great idea. My dad's actually on his way home for dinner right now and since it would be his decision, and if you're not busy, why don't you stay for dinner and have a chat with my dad. - Only if you will be joining us for dinner and some chat (giggles). - Please, come in. I hope you like rump roast. - Mm, sounds delicious, and I have cookies for dessert. (pleasant piano) (tense and ominous strings) (door slams shut) (tense and ominous strings) - Mindy, this is my sister, Nicole. - Oh, (gasps), oh! What a pleasure to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, Mindy. (vaguely unsettling piano over ominous ambient music) Are you here for my brother? - Actually, Nicole, Mindy's a realtor. She's interested in our house to sell. - Oh, really? (throbbing percussion) - I told her Dad was on his way home, and she can go over the details with him. I also invited Mindy for dinner. - I hope I'm not interrupting a family dinner! - Not at all, sweetie, why don't we have a glass of wine? Do you prefer white or red? - Whatever you have open is fine. - Great. - Nicole, why don't you take Mindy into the family room? I'll get some drinks, we have both open. - OK, then, red wine, please. - Mindy, this is our mom. - Nice to meet you. - I brought cookies. - Oh, how very sweet, thank you! I overheard you'll be staying for dinner, perfect! (laughs) Scott, drinks, please? - Sure, Mom. - OK, so, tell us how you've come to our home. - Well, there are no boundaries at our company, and, to be honest, I just pointed to a neighborhood on the map and your area is what I chose! - What about your coworkers. - Wouldn't someone have picked this area or have it assigned by your boss? - Actually, no, and my boss has no clue where I am (laughs)! We're free to solicit business wherever we feel comfortable. - Wow, I wish I had a boss that didn't care where I was. - And you don't have to call in or anything like that? - No, it's a really cool job! No micromanagement, I'm free to do as I choose, as long as I get results. - Well, Mindy, we're gonna do everything we can to make you feel very comfortable with us! - That sounds great! You are such nice people, I could stay here forever! - That sounds fabulous. - And we can arrange that. (all laughing over ominous electronic music) Come on in, let's have some drinks, play some games. You just, you know. - [Mindy] (laughs) I'm actually hungry! (footsteps clacking) - What did you find out? - She's perfect, no reporting to a boss, and no one knows where she is. Now, all we gotta do is find out what car she came with and ditch it. - That's the idea. (Nicole laughs) - Yeah, yeah. (pleasant easy listening music) Uh, so you've got a busy week ahead of you, that I heard, in district two, huh? - [Mindy] Mm-hmm. - OK, oh! (relaxed easy listening music) - You ladies having a nice conversation? - [Mindy] Mm. - Scott, you're always good at giving toasts. How about one? - Sure, Mom. Here's to meeting a new friend that will, hopefully, be with us long enough to make a lotta money. - I'll drink to that. Money's a good thing, and I hope my being here brings you lots. - I'm sure you will. - [Nicole] Cheers. - Cheers. - Mm, delicious! - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - Boy, that dinner smells delicious! - It's the freshest meat you can get! - You look pretty edible yourself. - [Scott] As do you. (Mindy chuckles) (pleasant easy listening music) (door rattling) - Hello, I'm home! - [Rachel] We're in the family room and we have company! - [Lewis] Hmm. (all laughing) Hello, baby! - Hi, Daddy! - Mm, glad you're home. - [Lewis] Hello, doll. - [Rachel] Hi. (lips smacking) - Dad, I'd like you to meet Mindy. - Please, sit down. To what do we owe this pleasure? - [Nicole] Mindy is a realtor. She has clients that may be interested in buying our home. - Well, that sounds promising. - We thought we'd have cocktails and then dinner, and then show her the house before dessert. - They forgot to mention I plan on making you lots of money. - I'm sure you will. You look very healthy. - Oh, I work out three times a week, so I'm in excellent condition (laughs). What do you do? - Actually, I'm a brain surgeon. - Oh, that's amazing! (scoffs) I don't know how you do that, the sight of blood makes me weak. - [Both] Most people feel that way (laughing). - No, our surgery's very specialized. Nicole, would you please help me serve the dinner? Scotty, open a nice bottle of wine for dinner. - Sure. - Oh, oh, please don't go to any trouble! - Don't be silly, it's no trouble at all. - Salud. (glasses clinking) (pleasant soft rock music) (footsteps clacking) - Thank you. - You're welcome, (groans mockingly). (Nicole sighs) - Oh, this smells delicious! What kind of meat is it? - [Scott] See if you can guess. - Mindy, be careful of Scott, he's a practical joker. - Oh, I grew up with a brother, so I'm used to that. (Lewis chuckles) (swell of ominous electronic music) (Mindy gasps) Mm, not sure, but it is tasty. - Well, good. - Mm, maybe I need some more wine to cleanse my palette. (tense and ominous electronic music) (liquid bubbling) (tense and ominous electronic music) - Cheers. (Mindy chuckles) (quietly menacing electronic music) - OK, one more bite, and then I will guess. Oh, mm! - Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! - I'm glad you're enjoying the meal. - It's Mama's special recipe. - Yeah, kind of a family secret. - I'm going to guess it is, um, a wild animal of some type. - In this case, you are close. - (gasps) I get it, did you hunt this, Scott? - You got me, I made the kill. - Am I good or what (laughs)? (scattered laughter) (Mindy belches) Oh, my apology. - No, darling, we all do it. - (gasps) That's never happened to me before! (sighs) Must be too much wine. - Sweetheart, no such thing. Wine is the nectar of the gods! (quietly tense and unsettling piano) - So, Mindy, do you have a boyfriend? - Why, Scotty, are you interested or curious or-- - We're all very interested. - Ooh, family affair. Oh (laughs), that did not sound right! I did not mean it that way (giggles). - That's OK, we're a tight family. - Oh, nothing kinky, I hope. - Of course not. - We do run a family business, though, um. Rachel is head nurse, and Scott and Nicole run the back office for orders. - I thought you were a brain surgeon. - I am, but we also have a small side business. - Mm, what kind of business? - We're in the parts business. - [Nicole] Body parts. - For cars? - No, we deal with real body parts. - Wait, wait, wait, wait (laughs). When you say real body parts, do you mean you have a tattoo business? - Maybe you should have another sip of wine. It will help you with your transition. - Transmission? (dramatic and tense orchestral music) (head thuds to table) - Oh-ho-OK, well done. Let's get her downstairs. And get the IV going so she sleeps all evening. Let's see what we got going. (head thuds to table) (dramatic and tense orchestral music) - Is everyone comfortable? (gasps) Oh, you poor boy! Nicole, please put a bit more morphine in his drip to ease his discomfort. - But, Mom, he said the F-word to me. - Well, that wasn't very nice! You know, their little brother never understood the importance of not using foul language. May he rest in peace. William, you promise me not to use that bad language again, and I will give you some pain relief. - Mom, he can't speak, remember? - Hmm, well, I'm in a good mood, so give him what he needs. (dramatic and tense orchestral music) - So, which patient is a donor for the kidney? - Jack. - Have you checked him for a match? - Yes, Dad, it's perfect. - OK, prep him up. (gloves thwacking) (William groans) Scott, do you have the donor carrying case ready? - [Scott] All set, Dad. - [Lewis] Rachel, are we ready? - [Rachel] Yes, Doctor. - [Lewis] Oh, so formal! - [Rachel] (laughs) Well, you are the leading brain surgeon in the country! - [Lewis] I suppose you are correct, darling, yes. Scalpel? - [Rachel] Scalpel. (flesh crunching over dramatic and tense orchestral music) - [Lewis] Organ skin retractor. - [Rachel] Skin retractor. (tense and increasingly ominous orchestral music) (scalpel scraping) - [Lewis] Here, honey, for your first solo, but first, tell me what do you see. - [Nicole] I see the right and left renal artery. - [Lewis] Excellent, my daughter the doctor! - [Rachel] Nicole we are so proud of you! You're going to make an excellent surgeon. - [Lewis] Good work, sweetheart. - [Nicole] Thanks, Daddy. - [Lewis] OK, let's lift it out, and-- (organ squishing) - [Nicole] From the kidneys I've seen, this one looks pretty healthy. - [Lewis] Excellent eyes. This is a good specimen. (tense electronic music) Good work, sweetheart, good work. - [Nicole] Thanks, Daddy. - [Scott] (laughs) Maybe I should ask for more money. - [Lewis] That's my boy! - [Nicole] Kay, you got it? - [Scott] Got it. - [Nicole] OK. - [Scott] OK, I'll make arrangements for the delivery. - [Lewis] Yes, please. (ominous electronic music) (Ralph sighs) - How may I help you. - Good evening, Ma'am. I'm Detective Swarez, this is Detective Davenport. We're investigating some missing persons. - Have you seen any of these people? - No, I can't say that I have. - Any John or Jane Does in the ER? - No, and as you know, we're required to notify the police if any come in. - Of course, we won't take up any more of your time. Here's my card, if anything does come in, will you please contact us? - Sure. - Thank you very much. (ominous electronic accent) - [Delivery Man] This is the organ donor that was requested. Order number 3445KDN. - Please sign in here for proof of delivery. - [Delivery Man] Of course! - This couldn't have come at a better time. This is certainly gonna save that girl's life. - We've done everything that we can. I'm so sorry to say, but your son is in critical need of a new heart. The valves were too badly damaged in the accident. (woman sobbing over dramatic piano and orchestral music) - Please say this isn't happening to me. Do something! Why can't you do something? You just fix it! (dramatic orchestral music) - How long do you think you can keep him alive while we wait for a new heart? - We have him on life support, but we can't have him there for long. - Do whatever it takes, Doc. - All right. (muffled chatter over ominous orchestral music) - [Delivery Man] I'm at the hospital making the delivery. There's a couple in need of a heart for their son. Just a heads up, there were some cops here inquiring about some missing persons. - OK, got it, thanks. (dramatic and ominous orchestral music) - Is everything all right, dear? - Yeah, Mom, just some cops snooping around the hospital about missing persons. Good news is, it seems a heart is needed. I'll make the call and negotiate the fee. - Great (laughs), Mom, it looks like you're gonna get that new dress! - Dress, what dress? - Oh, come on, Daddy, it's a really cute dress that Mom really needs, and it's on sale! - Oh, boy, those dreaded words! - [Nicole] What words? - On sale. - Now, boys, it's important that us girls look and feel our best. - All right, do I dare ask the cost? - Not unless you wanna be the next heart donor. (machine whirring) (hammer thwacking into skull) (machine whirring) (machinery rattling and whirring) - Are you almost done? (machine rumbles to a stop) Mom's souffle is about ready. - (sighs) Was it rude that we didn't serve Mindy a dessert? - Not really, Mom only made enough for four. Besides that, she's trailer trash. She probably doesn't even know what souffle is. - Kay, then I guess it worked out perfectly. - Uh-huh, so what do you think about my new blouse? - I don't think Mindy will miss it. - I know right (laughs)! - I gotta call the couple that needs a heart and get their permission from the doctor to get the specs and see if we have a match, and I won't mix and distribute the chips until tomorrow during the day, so. - OK, well, don't be too long otherwise I'm gonna eat your souffle. - Don't you dare! - (laughs) You've been warned! Oh, um, by the way, Mom needs some milk for coffee in the morning, do you wanna walk with me to the store after dessert? - I'd love to, but I still got a lot of chippin' to do. - OK, do you need anything? - No, I'm good. - All right. (slap thwacking) - How are we even related? - [Nicole] Blood, baby! (muffled chatter over ominous electronic music) (dramatic and ominous electronic music with thumping rhythm) (increasingly tense and ominous electronic music) (swell of tense electronic music) (Nicole gasps) - If you make a sound or scream for help, I swear to God, I'm gonna snap your fuckin' neck! I'm gonna take my hand away now. You understand what'll happen if you scream, yeah? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - Yeah? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm, (gasps) what do you want (grunts)? Do you want money, I have a 50 in my pocket. - I don't want your money, I want you! (Nicole shrieks over fence rattling) (dramatic and tense orchestral music) - (gasps) Hey, hey, hey, listen! There's no need to get rough, OK? I love sex, it excites me to do it with a stranger. (Nicole groaning) - If you like sex so much, show me your tits! - [Nicole] OK, OK, let go, let go. Can't be so rough with a lady, otherwise you're not gonna get any. - Stop lyin'. - You want more? - Yeah, show me. - OK. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. (quietly tense electronic music) Yeah. - Why don't you lie down and let me pleasure you? - All right, one false move, and I'll snap your neck like a pretzel. - We got it. Ah-ah, lemme do that. (zipper buzzing) Part of the turn on for me. (zipper buzzing over quietly tense electronic music) (man moans) (man gasping over dramatic and tense orchestral music) (knife clicks) (swell of tense electronic music) (knife crunching through flesh) (man groaning) (man groaning over knife crunching through flesh (tense and menacing electronic music) It woulda tasted better with mustard. (papers thwacking on desk) (Ralph spits) - Ralph, I just got a call that there's a dead body at the corner of the convenience store at Forest and Main. - You got a cause of death? - Yes, apparently, the throat was the killing blow. - What does that mean? - Well, it seems that he's missing his penis. - What do you mean he's missing his penis? - I mean it's missing as in gone, and according to the officer at the crime scene, it was cut clean with a knife, and there's no trace of the penis. - OK, got it, yeah. Uh, sounds like we might have a collector on our hands. - Why would anyone wanna collect a-- - I don't know why any sicko collects any part after they kill someone, but it happens. Let's just get down there before they contaminate the scene. - Good point, we wouldn't want any dick-tectives to contaminate the crime scene (laughs). - Funny, Jules, real funny. (Julie laughing) Get your gloves. - Why? - Oh, hey, I don't know, maybe because you're gonna be playing dick-tective until you find me that penis, that's why. - You have no sense of humor. Hey, at least it's not a missing person! - Gloves, and you owe me a hot dog! (helicopter whirring) (muffled police radio chatter over ominous electronic music) Jesus Christ, that's pretty fuckin' gruesome! (helicopter whirring) - Yeah, I've seen worse. (Ralph scoffs) - (sighs) Hey, Doc. You got a time of death for us? - Well, according to the body temp, I'd guess no more than two hours. - All right, sounds good. - OK, guys, I'll confirm the cause of death ASAP. - All right, thanks. - I found this by the bushes. Looks expensive. Looks like our perp is a woman. - Mm, all right, let's see, we've got a woman, an angry tranny or a sick couple into some nasty shit. Bag it and tag it for forensics. (bag rustling over dramatic piano and orchestration) - (whimpering) Hello? Can anyone hear me, help! Somebody help me, please! What the fuck is going on here? - No one can hear you, and there's no escape, so save your strength. - For what, what's with the oxygen tent? - That's the last stop. - Before? - Before you die. - Did you say die, what? God, why, I have no disease! - Did you try to sell them anything? - Sort of, I-I'm a realtor. - (clicks tongue) Bad house to call on. Does anybody know that you're at this address? - (sighs) No. My boss never asks and we never tell in fear of another broker trying to steal the listing. - Then you'll never leave here. - I don't understand. Lewis is a doctor and his wife is a nurse. Why would they keep us here and for what? Don't you people have any family or friends that will notice that you're missing? - I'm a single mom. My boys will be six years old. The last time I saw was when I dropped them off at school. (sobs) Who's gonna take care of my boys? - My mom is in a home. I'm all that she has left. It kills me to think of her staring out that window, waiting for me to visit and I'm not gonna be there. (Jack sobbing over dramatic electronic music) - My wife died three years ago and my kids rarely visit. I've two cats and two dogs, and they've been at my apartment ever since I got here. Must look great by now. (sighs) Poor critters. - I'm confused, what is it they want from us? - I don't know how to tell you this, but they sell our body parts. - Again with the body parts! What are you talking about? - They farm out our kidneys, lungs, heart, anything they can sell on the black market. - And it gets worse. - How can it get any worse than that? - They're cannibals. (swell of unsettling electronic music) (Lewis sighs) - Dad, here's our profit report from last month. - Scott, this looks fantastic. Thanks, man. (paper rustling) Well, time to go to work (sighs), have a good day, baby. - Bye, mwah. (lips smacking) - [Lewis] See ya, good buddy. - [Scott] Later, Dad. - Oh, I forgot to take something out for dinner. Nicole, could you please take care of that. - Hey, Mom, Scott and I are wondering if you can make the appetizers we like. - Fresh or frozen? - Fresh. - Agreed. - We will also need a small roast with the bone in. - OK. - Bye, babies. - Bye (lips smacking). - So, Sis, fresh roast and appetizers! - You got the key? (keys rattling) Oh, let's go! (latch rattling over ominous electronic music) (Nicole gasps) - [Scott] Every time! - Ha, beat you (laughs). - Come on, Nicole, you cheated! - [Nicole] Bullshit, how? - You pushed me to the wall. - Sore loser! - Excuse me, there must be some mistake. I'm not sick so can I please go home. - (laughs) Isn't she cute, she wants to go home! - My boss knows where I am, and he will send the police looking for me. (Scott and Nicole chuckle) - Good try, but you told us your boss and fellow workers have no clue where you are. - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - And for tellin' a fib, I think you need to be punished. Nicole? - Mm-hmm, naughty girl! I'll check their charts and adjust any medicine. Why don't you take Mindy into the other room? - The other room, what does that mean, the other room? Stop, where are you taking me? This just can't be serious, this is sick! - [Scott] Wrong, we have a family business to run, remember? Body parts and of course, all that hard work gives us an appetite. - Please, I have a lotta money. I, I, you can have all of it. I will move to another state, I-I'll never say a word! - Then how are we gonna make a decent living? Do you know how much money has been taken away from private medical practices? Doctors can barely make a profit anymore. (tense and ominous electronic music) - Scott, don't, please, don't! Scott (gasps), stop, where are you taking me? - Have you learned not to talk back to me? What's the matter, you got nothin' to say? Has a cat got your tongue? Oh, no, wait, I almost forgot, I did, and by the way, it was delicious. Now, since you seem to be behaving, I'm gonna increase your pain medicine so you're more comfortable. Would you like that? (tense and ominous electronic music) I asked you a question, William! You don't want another punishment, do you? That's better. (slaps thwacking) (Mindy whimpering over jarring electronic accent) (Mindy screaming over noisy electronic accent) (Mindy whimpering over tense and ominous electronic music) - Please, Scott, you seem like a great guy. I'm attracted to you, and I know we could have a great time together. - [Scott] I'm flattered, but no thanks. (Mindy screaming over jarring electronic accent) I'm gonna give you a few doses of morphine so you won't feel anything. (Mindy sobbing and gasping) (Mindy grunts angrily) (Mindy sobs) (Mindy gasping over increasingly tense electronic music) You have beautiful fingers. - Scott, please don't do what it is you're thinking about doing! (Mindy screaming over punchy electronic accent) Please, I beg you! I will do whatever you want! (tense and menacing electronic music) - [Scott] Ready? - For what? (tense and menacing electronic music) Oh, for God's sake, Scott! (Scott chuckling) Please! - No God here. (Mindy screaming over whirring saw) (Mindy screaming over menacing electro rock music) - (shrieks) You're fucking crazy! (hatchet crunching into flesh) (Mindy gasps) (pleasant easy listening music with airy flute) (carrots rattling in pan) (pleasant easy listening music with airy flute) (whisk rattling in bowl) (pleasant easy listening music with flowing woodwinds) (oil sizzling over pleasant easy listening music) - Nicole, please take care of the appetizers, and I'll finish the dishes. - [Nicole] Sure, Mom. (pan clanging) (oil sizzling) - [Scott] Oh, Mom, how long until the roast is ready? I'm starving! - (scoffs) Scotty, you're always starving! Alphabetical order, please. - Mm, somethin' smells great! - Yay, mwah, hi, honey! Drinks? - Sure, champagne. - Uh, with a little creme de cassis, please! - Here it comes! (bottles rattling) Scott, Nicole? - I want a dry rum. - What are you havin', Dad? - Uh, I'll start with a martini, and I'll have wine with dinner. - Works for me, I'll get the shaker out. - Great. - OK, thank you, bye. I just got off the phone with my friends at the bureau, and you know that earring we found? - Yeah, what about it? - Well, it seems that there's only one jeweler in the entire city that carries that specific design. - That's good news. OK, tomorrow morning, we'll swing by and see if they have records on any of the buyers. Also, the captain wants us to start conducting door-to-door interviews to see if anyone can ID any of these people. - OK, I'll get it organized. What have you got? - (laughs) Nothin', not a damn thing. You know, it just doesn't add up! I mean, usually, after a while, we come up with a body. - That's weird. Each one of these people seem to have non-traditional jobs, meaning they didn't just sit in an office, they're out and about. - OK, I'll bite. - Well, say we're dealing with a serial killer, then these would be the perfect victims for someone to stalk and attack. - All right, assuming that you're correct, how does the earring factor into it? - She could've been an accomplice to lure the victims. - (sighs) Yeah, but if that's the case, then where are the bodies? I mean, hell, at this point, I would take just a piece of a body. (Scott groans) - Yum. Great seasoning, Nicole, meat's so tender, it just falls right off the bone. - [Nicole] Thanks, Scotty. - Agreed. (bone tinking on plate) - I have a toast to make. - OK. You have our undivided attention, Mom. - First, to your father for his achievement and pending award as the country's leading brain surgeon. - Thank you, dear. - And secondly, to Scott for his brilliant business acumen. - [Nicole] Mm. - And to Nicole, for your first successful surgery. I can't think of a more loving family! To us! - [All] Cheers. (glasses tinking) (timer buzzing) - Mm, looks like dinner's ready. - Yay! (doorbell ringing) Hm, more dinner. (Nicole moans) - I'll get it. (Rachel chuckles) - I hope so. (Rachel chuckling) (Lewis chuckles) (lips smacking) - This was on your porch. - Thank you. - I'm Detective Davenport, and this is my partner, Detective Swarez. - [Lewis] Well, good evening, officers. May I help you? - May we come in for a few minutes? - [Lewis] Please, by all means. - Dad, I'm gonna go help Mom in the kitchen and put this in your office, mwah! (tense and ominous electronic music) - Is there a problem? - Not at all, we're simply conducting door-to-door interviews in the neighborhood with photos of some missing persons. - Do you recognize any of these people or have you seen them in the neighborhood recently? (photos rustling over quietly tense piano) - Can't say that I have. (Julie sniffing) - Sorry for sniffing, I didn't get lunch today, and something smells amazing. - That's my wife's cooking. May I offer you two a sandwich to go? - Oh, no, thanks, we appreciate the offer. - Uh, can you confirm for our records that this is the home of Dr. Lewis Cutterman. - Yes, it is, and I am Dr. Cutterman. - All right. Thank you, Doctor. Uh, we won't keep you from dinner with your family. Here's my card, if you do happen to see any of these people, would you please contact us? - Certainly. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, good night. (door rattling) What a nice guy! - Yeah, our job would be a helluva lot easier if everyone was as nice as him. - (sighs) I should've taken him up on that offer for that sandwich, I'm starving! - Oh, really, I know a great place just down the way. They sell the roast beef sandwiches with the dipping sauce, but I suggest getting it rare. It's the best way to eat it. - Sounds good to me. - Arright. (ominous electronic music) - They're real, real diamonds, your daddy bought that for me, isn't that fantastic? - [Nicole] Pretty, was that the anniversary gift? - Oh, yeah, honey, what did they want? - It's all good. They're canvassing the neighborhood for missing persons. - [Rachel] Hmm, hmm! (all laughing) Oh, my goodness! Well, then, that's settled, dinner is served, and then we have a heart to deliver tonight. - A $350,000 heart. (Lewis clicks his tongue) - Well done, brother! Mom, it sounds like some yellow diamonds for us! - Yes, darling, big ones. Yeah, sweetheart, yellow. - Hello, William. How are you doing, little buddy? - H-Honey, uh, he can't talk too well after the naughty word he used. - William, William, we do not use vulgarity in this house. I hope you learned your lesson. (slaps thwacking) OK, so, prep the operating room. I want it spotless. - Got it, Dad. - Should I start William on his pre-op anesthesia? - Well, thank you, sweetheart, that would be wonderful. - OK. - Good, good. (Lewis sighs) - Now, William, you're not still mad at me, are you? After all, you're the one that used that nasty word. You're gonna feel a cold sensation, and then you're gonna get tired. Everything is gonna be fine, Daddy's really good at this. Scott, can you please help me roll William over to the operating table? - Sure, Sis. (bed rattling) (dramatic piano over unsettling orchestral music) - [Nicole] Dad, William is prepped and ready. - [Lewis] Here we go. (dramatic piano over ominous orchestral music) Nicole, what is the procedure for transplanting a heart? - [Nicole] Surgeons remove the patient's heart, except for the back walls of the atria. - [Lewis] Scalpel. - [Rachel] Scalpel. - [Nicole] The backs of the atria on the new heart are opened up, and then the heart is sewn into place. Surgeons then connect all the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow into the heart and lungs. - [Rachel] Skin retractor. - [Nicole] As the heart warms up, it begins to beat. (flesh crunching) - [Lewis] Saw, please? - [Scott] Here you go, Dad. - [Nicole] Before removing the patient from the heart-lung machine, surgeons check all the connective blood vessels and the heart chambers for leaks. (saw whirring over ominous electronic music) (Lewis sighs) (whooshing electronic accent) - [Lewis] OK, ready for the spreader. - [Rachel] Nicole, please get the spreader. (Lewis sighs) (spreader clanking) (whooshing electronic accent) - [Lewis] All right, time to bypass the heart. Lemme get this sucker on life support. Nicole, I want you to look at this, and I want you to tell your Daddy what you see. - [Nicole] I see the right and left coronary artery, the, uh, posterior descending artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the acute marginal artery. - [Scott] I'm impressed, Sis. - [Nicole] Thanks, bro. - [Rachel] And I think we're ready, Lewis. - [Lewis] Good work, team! OK, here we go. (dramatic piano over tense electronic music) If you only knew (chuckles). (gloves clacking) (dramatic piano over tense electronic music) - [Scott] OK, I gotta make a phone call and get this heart to the hospital. - [Lewis] Be careful! - [Rachel] And could you please stop and pick up some chocolate. I always have a chocolate craving after surgery. (all chuckling) - [Scott] Sure, Mom. - [Lewis] OK, girls, let's close him up. (dramatic piano) - Yoo-hoo, Scotty! - Great, here comes shit-for-brains motormouth busybody! - Well, hello, Scott! - Hello, Mrs. Rogers, how are you today? - I'm just fine, thank you. I'm taking Precious for a walk. - Oh, Precious, you wanna play in that nasty little dirt? - (gasps) Heavens no, I just gave Precious a bath, and we don't want dirty feet in our house, do we, sweet girl (kissing)? - (laughs) Oh, Precious, listen to your mommy. - You know, I just can't believe how beautiful your flowers always look. Now, Scott, I know you're using something special in your garden because you have the best flowers, so if I promise not to tell anyone, will you share your secret with me? - Well, to tell you the truth, I do have a special ingredient. - Ooh, I knew it, I told all the girls in the neighborhood that you are so smart and handsome that you must have something special in your garden. - OK, you win, there are two special ingredients I use, but you promise not to tell anyone, right? - Cross my heart and hope to die! - (laughs) OK, so besides the top-grade premium soil, I add some root stimulants, and then I add a small amount of bone meal. - Thank you so much, and don't worry, it'll be our little secret. - I bet. - Bye! (Scott chuckles) Say bye, Precious! - Bye, Precious! - [Mrs. Rogers] Bye, Scott! - Bye (chuckles). - [Mrs. Rogers] Thanks! (bird cawing) - Oh, God, if you weren't such a pain in the ass, I'd cook you, but you'd probably taste like shit. Unfortunately for you, we don't like the taste of dog meat. (traffic whooshing) (door rattling) (alarm buzzing) (door creaking) - Good morning. - Morning, I'm Detective Davenport, and this is my partner, Detective Swarez. - Morning. - Do you recognize this earring? - Absolutely. This is one of our finest designs. It was custom made by the Pauline Alexander, the famous designer. We are the exclusive jeweler in the entire city to carry that piece. - Oh, that's good news. Do you happen to keep a record of who purchased them? - Yes, there were four sales. Three were by credit card, one was by cash. - Did the cash customer happen to leave an address? - I believe so, let me check. - Thank you. (swell of dramatic orchestral music) (monitors beeping over quietly tense orchestral music) - (sighs) That poor bastard. - (sighs) What do you mean, poor bastard? We're all heading there. - Isn't there anything we can do? - Not unless you have a cellphone that can get reception down here. - What about trying to escape? - It's never gonna happen, especially because we all have one leg and one hand, and I know they keep the door upstairs locked, and we'd never be able to fight Scott or his sick sister. - Maybe not, but maybe we can slow them down from making a profit from our parts. - How do you plan to do that? Eat poison? (dramatic electronic music) - Jack, what the fuck do you think you're doing? - I'm gonna fuck up their profit and loss statement. - And how are you gonna do that? You know that when they find out, they won't take it lightly, and you know what that means! - Yeah, I know. - I don't, what does that mean? - It means that they're gonna take away pain medication and they make it more painful for poor behavior. - [Jack] When they discover their assets have been reduced, I'll take the blame and the pain. - Jack, why? - [Jack] If I'm gonna die here and never see my mom again, I wanna go out fighting. - That's not a fair fight! They have all the cards. - Not really, I have a little surprise for their torture game. (monitors beeping) (sighs) William, forgive me for what I'm about to do, but I know you would've wanted me to do this. (monitors beeping) (Priscilla sobbing over dramatic orchestral music) (monitors beeping) (Mindy coughs) (monitors beeping over dramatic orchestral music) (sustained beeping tones over more tense orchestration) - No! (Mindy sighs) (expressive piano over dramatic orchestral music) (Priscilla sobs) (Mindy whimpering) (expressive piano over dramatic orchestral music) (alarm buzzing steadily) - Crap, what are they up to? (tense and ominous electronic music) Which one of you dumb motherfuckers did this? - I did. - So you got out of your comfortable bed and decided to be stupid? I've been generous and gone out of my way to make you comfortable and pain-free, haven't I? - What is your point, Scott? You're eating us, you're farming our body parts for sale, how's that generous (laughs)? - You ungrateful piece of shit! OK, so you wanna be a big shot? Let's see how you respond to no pain medication. How's that sound, hero? - I heard the buzzer, what's up? (tense and ominous electronic music) Which one? - Jerk-off Jackie. - Jack, did you get out of bed? (panting) Guess we need to make sure that doesn't happen anymore, huh? - [Scott] Good call, Nicole, let's get our play tools while I set up. - Oh, fuck yeah! - Allow me to introduce ya'll to the punishment chair. (Jack whimpering over tense and menacing electro rock music) By the way, did Nicole mention the movie Misery? (bones cracking) (Jack shrieking) - You guys, don't, you gotta stop it! (Mindy whimpering) - That hurt? Well, how 'bout this? (bones cracking) (Jack screaming over crunching bones and tendons) (Mindy shrieks) (Jack coughs) - Oh my God! (Jack shrieking over menacing electronic music) (bones cracking) - Oh, no, you don't! No falling asleep while we're having fun! - Good idea, Sis. (menacing electronic music) (syringe thwacking into flesh) (Jack shrieks) (Mindy and Priscilla groaning) - I'm gonna give your leg some pain relief while we work on other parts. (Jack groaning over menacing electronic music) (Jack panting) - You havin' fun fuckin' your sister, Scott? Can't get a real guy to fuck this bitch? - You just don't know when to keep your mouth shut, do you? All right big shot, you ever hear of the movie called Marathon Man? Now, Jack, this is goin' to hurt you more than it's gonna hurt me. (drill whirring over increasingly tense electronic music) - Open! He's ready, Scott! - For the record, I got laid the other night, so you can go fuck yourself! (drill whirring over tense, menacing electronic music) - Stop it! (Jack shrieking over menacing electronic music) (Mindy whimpering) (drill whirring over menacing electronic music) (Jack shrieking) (Priscilla shrieking) (Jack gurgling and groaning) - No (whimpering)! (Jack groaning over whirring drill) - No, no (sobs)! - I'm done with this. Time to wake up. (syringe thwacking into flesh) (Jack gasping and panting) - [Scott] Having fun? Did you know that the eyes are quite good to eat raw? - It's kind of a combination of sushi with a creamy filling. (Jack shouts) (scalpel crunching into eye socket) (Nicole gasps) - Jack! - [Scott] Son of a bitch, he killed himself! (Mindy whimpers) - Isn't that a sin? - Oh, I believe it is. (Nicole laughs) Well, let's not waste a good thing. - Absolutely. (Mindy gasping) (throbbing and menacing electronic music) (Priscilla wailing) (whooping and menacing electronic music) - Oh, you're sick! (menacing electronic music with pulsing accents) (Mindy whimpers) (menacing electronic music with whooping accents) (Mindy coughing) (swell of menacing electronic music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh, hi, Nicole. What, when? (tense electronic music) Is your brother there to help you? Mm-hmm. OK, got it, yeah. OK, we'll have to write this off as a business loss. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell your mom. No, don't worry, baby, it's fine. OK, sweetheart, we'll see you later. Mwah (snaps tongue)! - Is everything OK? - Yes and no. There was a situation in the home, but the kids took care of it (sighs). - Well, what happened? - Well, Jack pulled the plug on William, and the kids decided to punish Jack. - Oh, well, that seems fair. - It would be, except for Jack decided to kill himself, so, so we lost two sellable, valuable commodities. - Well, not all is lost. - Meaning? - We could have liver and onions for dinner. - [Nurse On PA] Dr. Cutterman, you're needed in neuroradiology. Dr. Cutterman to neuroradiology. - (lips smacking) You always look on the bright side! I love you. (Rachel laughs) - [Both] Mwah! (lips smacking) - I love you, too. (Lewis clears his throat) I'll call the kids to make sure they have the liver ready and they can pick up an onion at the store. - [Lewis] OK, darling. - Good luck! - So I have a challenge for you, or a contest. - [Scott] I'm game, what's up? - I bet you 25 grand William's liver tastes better than Jack's. - Really? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. (tense and ominous electronic music) - 25K, huh? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - Good try, Sis, but that's stackin' the deck! You see, that smile on your face that gives you away! - What, why? - You know full well that with all the drugs Jack was given for his surgery, his liver's gonna taste slightly bitter even with Mom's sauteed onions. - Fuck, you're too smart. (scalpel swishing) (entrails plopping on floor) (Scott grunts) - Nicole, why don't you take the livers up to the refrigerator, and I'll finish up down here. - You got it. (dramatic piano over ominous electronic music) - [Scott] Oh, Nicole? - Yes? - Don't forget to run to the store for the onions. - Absolutely, who knows, maybe I'll have an appetizer while I'm out. - (scoffs) You're such a dork! - [Nicole] Shut up! (Scott scoffs) (muffled screaming on TV) - [Lewis] So which show is this, Nicole? - Zombies From Galaxy F-O. - Zombies From Galaxy. (thumping and rattling on TV) (sighs) Hey, doll. - How was work, Mom and Dad? - Oh, same stuff, different day. Well, it was! (doorbell rings) - OK. - Nicole, will you go see who that is? - Beats me. - Could be dessert! (door rattling) - Bonsoir, my name is Jean. - Well, hello there! Is that a French accent? - Oui, I am a French-Canadian. - How may I help you? (pleasant accordion) - It would be, uh, my pleasure to introduce you to some fine perfumes from France, and that, uh, no cost for trying our samples, of course. - Perfume, huh, I'd love to try some on, especially for free (laughs). Please, why don't you come in and meet the family? - I hope I'm not, uh, interrupting anything. - No, no, no, not at all, we were just about to have cocktails before dinner. - Well, if you are sure. - Absolutely, come on in. (vaguely unsettling piano) Did I mention I love French cuisine? - [Rachel] First a toast, (pleasant soft rock music) we'd like to welcome our new friend, Gene. - Mom, it's pronounced Jean. - Into our home, and hope he stays a while. - Oh-ho-ho, thank you, I, I could stay here forever with your kindndess. - I'll drink to that. (rhythmic and pleasant easy listening music) - Mm, bon, this, your wine is excellent. - So, are you married or do you have a girlfriend? - Nicole, that was very rude, mm-mm. - I was sitting here wondering the same about Nicole. - Nope, I'm totally single. - May I, uh, propose a toast? - [Rachel] Mm. - I toast that we all become, uh, good friends, and that you enjoy the perfume samples, and, uh, that we get to have dinner together very soon. - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. (rhythmic and pleasant easy listening music) - Phew, pardon me, I'm, I'm feeling (sighs), what is the word, uh, a bit, uh, tipsy. (rhythmic and pleasant easy listening music) - Jean, it isn't called tipsy in English. It's called drugged. (phones ringing over fax machine whirring) - Oh, hi, Tammy! How you doing, baby? Ralph, why don't you come down and see me sometime? You too, baby (giggles)! (phone ringing over muffled office chatter) - It's been days all we have are some neighbors in different parts of the city saying they saw these people. - Yeah, and with that, the captain feels that our door-to-door interviews were a bust. We're being reassigned. - Wait, wait, wait, what about the missing cases we're working on? - Were working on is correct. The entire city has been assigned to the kidnapping of the mayor's niece. Our missing persons are being sent to cold storage. - So we just walk away? What about the fucking earring lead? - Look, Jules (sighs), I know you're dedicated and that you wanna stop crime, but sometimes, you just haveta know when to walk away. All right, the resources are just not there for us to keep chasing ghosts. - Ghosts? - Yeah, ghosts. Without a solid lead, without a single shred of evidence, the captain'll catch hell from the city attorney for spending resources that don't show the public we're defending them. - So, the public will feel safe, because all law enforcement's focused on the kidnapping because we don't have anything to parade in front of the cameras? - Yes, unfortunately, that is how it works. - That's bullshit! - I agree. (birds chirping) - [Rachel] Good book? - Oh, yes, it's excellent, I can't stop reading it. Suspense, espionage, conspiracy theory, what's not to like? - Mm, kay, you know, the kids seem awfully happy these days. - Can you blame them? Business is up, our Swiss bank accounts are bulging. - Mm, Lewis? - [Lewis] Hmm? - How 'bout a change? - What do you mean? - Well, I mean, this house. You know how I love to move every so often and remodel and change things, change is good! - You do get restless, baby. - Restless, we've been in this house for five years! - Five great years. - Yes. - I'll tell you what, we'll start to look around if it'll make ya happy. - Oh, Lewis, you're the best husband a woman could have. I love you. - I love you, too, baby. - (giggles) Mwah! (lips smacking) I'll tell the kids they can cut two roasts from Gene, and stick it in the freezer, and we can have leftovers for a few days. - What about appetizers? (tense and ominous orchestral music) (grinder rattling over ominous electronic music) (meat squishing over increasingly menacing electronic music) (cleaver thwacking over blood splattering) - Nicole, please wheel Jean into the patient room and start him on antibiotics and stronger pain meds. - Sure thing. - And don't worry about your leg, bud. I'll take real good care of it (chuckles). - W-what are you doing? Why (panting)? Nicole, we can still be together, I will not tell anyone about this. - Now, Jean, how could I possibly date a man with one leg and one arm (scoffs)? That would mean I'd have to do all the chores, is that fair? - You f-f-fucking Americans are, are crazy! People know where I am, you will be arrested! - Now, Jean, we know how you came to us, you told us, remember? And we have a house rule, no vulgarity or you will be punished. Just ask your fellow patients. - Fellow patients? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - You mean there are others? - Of course, how else do you think we're gonna eat? - Uh, eat, eat what? - You, of course. Ladies, I'd like for you to meet Jean. He's francais, (laughs mockingly). - Oh, good, Gene is sleeping. - I gave him a good dose of morphine to get him through the night, and Mom, it's pronounced Jean, not Gene. - Well, that's very thoughtful, and I'm glad your French lessons have paid off! But this is America, and his name is Gene. Priscilla, Gene! Mindy, are you in any pain? - Rachel, please let us go! Isn't it bad enough we have to live with one leg and one hand? Y-you guys probably have enough money to disappear and never be seen again! - Ah, Mindy, I agree with ya. We do have enough money, but we like living here in the States. Going on the lam would mean I'd have to give up my practice, and if I did that, a lot of people could die without my surgical expertise, or even worse, they could be invalids, right? - You can't be serious! You farm our body parts and eat us! How could you be saving lives? - Oh, baby, we have to agree to disagree. We have different points of view! - And we're not killing people for the sake of killing, we need nourishment just like you do, except we don't go to the grocery store where everything is neatly packaged. - Exactly. - What the hell does that mean? - It means we hunt and live off the land. We prepare our food naturally. We don't buy chicken or steak that comes in a package (mimics retching). You civilized people seem to think that because you didn't see the meat get killed, that it's OK. Well, we do our own work for survival, and we don't waste any parts like slaughterhouses do. - I can't believe what I'm hearing right now. You actually believe this is OK? - A lot of tribes use all the parts of an animal to avoid waste. We do the same thing, but we're also saving lives by selling your parts. - What about us? - Are you serious? You're making us out to be the bad people when you all came to our house with your own personal agendas. You think you can just intrude on people's privacy whenever you feel like it without any consequences? - Yeah, you all saw the sign, "No solicitors," but you chose to ignore the warning. And what part of "No solicitors" didn't you understand? So don't blame us for your death by solicitation (chuckles). Hey, babe, I'll see ya upstairs. - OK, mwah! - Mwah! - And if you think about it, you're one person. With your parts, we can save many lives. Therefore, your life in exchange for several seems reasonable, and we get to eat while in the process. - You are all just murderers, no matter how you justify it. (dramatic orchestral music) Why don't you just kill us (snivels)! Let us be in peace! - Your organs will spoil faster than we could sell them. - Kids, I think we're upsetting them. Please top off their meds, and meet your father and I upstairs for cocktails. - OK. - OK? (patients sobbing over quietly menacing electronic music) - 'Night, Mindy. - Oh, isn't that sweet! Why don't you go join Mom and Dad upstairs, I'll finish up here. - Thanks. - Welcome. - See you upstairs. - Yep. (tense and quietly menacing electronic music) (Nicole speaking in foreign language) (uneasy piano over dreamy electronic music) Mm, (laughs) sorry, I mean, you are going to taste delicious, my sweet darling. Sleep well (kissing). (tense and quietly menacing electronic music) (crickets chirping) (glass shattering) (dramatic piano and orchestral music over throbbing rhythm) (drawers rattling) (burglar gasps) (tableware rattling) - Oh, hello, what do we have here? (purse rustling) Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talkin' about! What else we got in here? (purse rustling) Phone, (purse rustling) charming! Hmm. (dramatic piano over tense orchestral music) (sniffs) Smells OK. Probably some exotic meat for the rick folk. (spits) Damn, whatever that shit is, it's nasty! Fucking rich white people, why can't they just eat bologna? (door handle rattling) You have got to be kidding me! (rhythmic and tense electronic music) (latch rattling) (handle snaps) Piece a cake! (rhythmic and tense electronic music) (door creaking) (increasingly tense and ominous electronic music) What the fuck? (flashlight thwacks to floor) (rhythmic and tense electronic music) - Please don't be scared! (bag rattles on floor) We're being held prisoner, can you help us get outta here? - Damn, bitch, what's up with this shit? - We don't have a lot of time to explain, but the short version is they're, they're selling our body parts! - Who are you? - I'm Santa Claus! I don't know what's going on here, but all I came here for was to rob these people! - These people are animals! They're selling our body parts and eating us! - Say what? - They're cannibals. - Are you fucking with me? - No, I swear to God! - Then the meat I started to eat was-- - Probably one of us. - Man, that's some fucked up shit! - Listen, please help us get out of here! I'll explain everything to you and the cops. - Look lady, I'm a burglar. I can't get involved with this shit! And in your condition, you'll probably just slow me down and get me caught! - You can't just leave us here! - Tell you what, I'm gonna leave, and when I get to a public phone, I'll call the cops. They can work all this shit out. - Behind you! (menacing electronic music) (women grunting over tense electronic music) (strike thudding) (Nicole groans) - [Burglar] Oh, shit! (Nicole gasping) - What the fuck are you all looking at? (groans) God, Jesus Christ! (unsettling electronic music) (crickets chirping over dramatic piano and ambient music) (keyboard clacking) (phone ringing) - Swarez. - Hello, I want to report a burglar in my neighborhood. - [Ralph] All right, what's your location, please? - (scoffs) Well, I'm at Dr. Cutterman's house on Valley Road, I just saw a stranger running from the side of his house. - And what's your name, please? - This is Mrs. Rogers. - Oh, yes, Mrs. Rogers. Well, thank you very much for calling it in. We'll be sure to send someone by as quickly as we can. All right, good night. - [Mrs. Rogers] I just can't believe-- (phone slams on cradle) - Mrs. Rogers, a.k.a. the neighborhood busybody? - The one and the same. No need to send anyone by, the woman's a nutcase. - Thank God, she's a piece of work! And besides that, we don't have the resources to go chasing ghosts! - I spoke with your cousin this morning. He'll be joining us for dinner tonight. - OK, cool. Dad, Mom (sighs), are we gonna be OK with what happened last night? - Well, Nicole, I certainly hope so! Don't feel too badly, we'll figure out something. Scott, you know how your cousin loves our ribs with barbecue sauce, could you please cut some up for dinner tonight? - Sure, Mom, we have plenty in the freezer. - OK, you babies have a great day today. Mwah, behave, get it all done, OK, sweet girl? Mwah, I love you, sweetie. - [Nicole] I love you, too. - I'll run down to the freezer and get the ribs ready. - OK, I'll check on the liquor and make sure we have enough single malt and wine for Cuz. - Perfect, off we go. - Apre vous. (plate rattling on counter) - Every time, Nicole, God! (tense and ominous electronic music) (swell of menacing electronic music) This is gonna be a feast from our friend Kate. (cleaver thwacking) (ominous electronic music) (oven beeps) - How's that, Mom? - Excellent, Nicole, I'm so proud of you! - Thanks. - A toast, to our new cook in the family! Thank you, darling. Thank you. - Cheers! - Oh, sweetheart. (glassing clinking) - Let's hope you have the same flair for seasoning that Mom has. - [Rachel] Mm-hmm. - I think she does, Scott. - I was watching, and she used the exact same ingredients as your mom, so I suspect it'll be mouth-watering delicious! - Thank you, Daddy. (lips smacking) - Love you, baby. - I love you. (punch thudding) - Ow, what was that for? - For not supporting me, dude. Hear me roar! (Scott laughs mockingly over group chuckling) - Oh. (doorbell rings) - Ooh! - Who could that be? - Our cousin, you dork! Take that, Mom. - [Scott] Duh, jeez, maybe the seasoning ruined your sense of humor, Nicole! - Duh, maybe the seasoning ruined your sense of humor! Shall we get it? - After you, lioness, psych! - Wow, you're lucky I am in heels! - Dr. Cutterman, your children are naughty. - Ah, they are fantastic! (Rachel scoffs) (door rattling) (tense and ominous electronic music) (Ralph sighs) (door slams shut) (latch rattling) (tense and ominous electronic music) (swell of tense strings) (dramatic piano over ominous electronic music) - You lose somethin'? - Cuz, (laughs) you found my earring (shrieks)! Thank you, mwah! (Ralph chuckling) - [Ralph] You're welcome. (Nicole giggling) - [Scott] Good to see ya, Ralph. - You, too, buddy. (Nicole laughs) - Now you, young lady, got lucky. With all the attention on the kidnapping of the mayor's niece, it was possible for me to get this out of evidence without being seen. - I'm sorry. - It's arright. Now, how are my two favorite cousins, huh? - [Both] Good. - Yeah, well, what smells so damn good? - [Nicole] I cooked dinner. - Really? - [Nicole] Mm-hmm. - [Scott] Do you still wanna stay? - (chuckles) Well, now that depends, what are we having? - As if you don't know, ribs! - Well, how could I say no, huh? How 'bout a drink first? - [Nicole] Yes! - Sounds good. (Ralph chuckles) - [Ralph] Ah, thank you, Nicole. - You're welcome, Cuz. - So, about the burglar. - [Ralph] Mm-hmm. - Would you be able to find out if there's any need for concern? - I brought a kit, I'm gonna dust for prints, take 'em down to the station in the morning. I'll run 'em, see if she works alone or if she's part of a crew. - Ah, thanks, Ralph. - No problem. (timer buzzing) Hey, that sounds like dinner time! - Here we go. - [Ralph] All right. (phone buzzing over fax machine whirring) - [Lewis] Hello? - Lewis, hey, it's Ralph. - [Lewis] What'd you find out? - There's no cause for concern. She's a small-time junkie nobody with a laundry list of priors. Mostly, uh, first- and second-story jobs. This isn't the kind of scumbag who's gonna come forward, and if she does, well, it'll land on my desk, and then we can just, uh, make sure it goes away for good. - [Lewis] That's a relief. - Yes, it is. Listen, please tell, uh, Rachel thank you for dinner last night, it was very, very tasty. - [Lewis] Ah, she'll appreciate that. How's the search been going for the mayor's niece? - We, uh, we have a suspect in custody, and looks like we got our man. Oh, by the way, before I forget to tell you, the captain ordered me to send all of my missing person's down to cold case files, so that should take care of any other little problems there might be. Listen, I gotta run, it's great catchin' up with you, though. We'll talk soon, arright, ciao. - How was family dinner? - Good. - What'd you have? - Ribs (sighs). - (scoffs) You're one lucky bastard having loving family members around, especially ones who can cook! You'll have to have me over for dinner sometime. - I'll see what I can arrange. (pleasant easy listening music) - Kids, your father and I have an announcement to make. - Don't tell us you're pregnant! - Now, where did that come from? - I don't know, you're adults and you do adult things. (Rachel sighs) - [Scott] Nicole, you have issues. - What? - So what's the news? - Well, your father and I have decided it's time to move. - (gasps) I call dibs on the first choice of rooms! - No way, you got it last time! - (sighs) That's right, but if a bedroom has its own bathroom, I'm sure you're gonna be a good brother and let me have it, right? - Now that is up for some careful negotiating. - Oh, God, I know what that means! I'm gonna be doing your chores forever. - And then some. (Nicole mimics retching) - So to prepare, Scott, you will sterilize the cutting room and the freezer. You have to make sure there are no traces that can be detected, you got me? - Got it covered, Dad. - [Rachel] And I'll call my brother's moving company and make sure they do all the heavy lifting. - [Nicole] What about all the sellables? - [Lewis] Well, we won't take any more business, and our current inventory, we shall delete, and when we move, we'll start again. - Back in business. (dramatic orchestral music) - Lunch is served. (door rattling) (woman sobbing over ominous electronic music) - Why, why are you doing this (sobs)? Please, let me go, I won't say a word, I promise! (sobs) I won't, I won't say a word! (sobs) Please, let me go! (woman sobbing over tense and menacing orchestral music) Why are you doing this? (swell of tense and menacing orchestral music) You sick fuck! (Ralph grunting over jarring percussion accent) - You, my dear, are going to taste delicious! (woman screams over tense and menacing electronic music) (jarring percussion accent) (pleasant easy listening music) - Oh, by the way, Mom needs some milk for coffee in the morning. Do you wanna walk with me (playful mumbling). OK (laughs). - I found this by the bushes. Looks like our perk, perp. (crew laughing) - [Director] Keep rolling, keep rolling! - Oh, is the camera still on, oh my God! (crew chuckles) - [Director] Action! (crew laughing) - [Eric] I should go. (pleasant easy listening music with breezy flute) - And secondly, to Scott, for his brilliant business acumen. And to Nicole, for your, for your, (crew muttering and laughing) Nicole! - I feel like chopped liver! - Don't take it personally, Nicole! - Wah! - Wait, wait, no, wait, for your, uh, for your first successful surgery, I'm so sorry. - [Director] For her! - Her. - Do you happen to have the, duh, the, them. - [Onlooker] The, them, them, the-- - [Clerk] Leave an address? - That would be helpful, yeah, thanks. - [Clerk] Lemme check. (crew laughing) - It wasn't me (cackles). - [Slate Man] Take one, shot six. (slate clacking over muffled chatter) - Oh my God, you saved the movie! - [Director] Action! - [Rachel] Rachel, Gene. - Whoa, whoa, Rachel? You're Rachel (laughs). (Beverly laughs) - What is, what is your name? - Her name's Rachel (laughs). - And you're Priscilla. - I'm Priscilla, people, Priscilla! - Could you please cut some up for binner, for dinner tonight? - [Scott] Sure, Mom. Sure, Mom, we have plenty in the freezer. - Perfect, please do it soon so the meat has time to defrost and get to room tick, temperature. - [Scott] Sure, Mom, we have plenty in the freezer. - Perfect, please do it soon, so the meat has time to get to, to de, sorry, say it again for me. (muffled laughter) (rhythmic and ominous electronic music) (dramatic and ominous orchestral music) (expressive flute over flowing piano and orchestration) (dramatic piano over ominous orchestral music) (swell of tense electronic music) - (mimics playful trumpet) And that's all, folks.
