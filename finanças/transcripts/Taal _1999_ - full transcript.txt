This is impossible! This is manav from bombay. - Father... - what's wrong? Why do you sound scared? Is the situation tense? Father... mansi... so father has found out? Y es... "all right. Give the line to him. - Father, it is manav." I'm sorry i couldn't meet you before leaving. I wanted to talk to you. But i couldn't. I'm glad you found out that i... are you listening? - Y es. Go on. I wanted to say the promise i made to mansi before i left... ...that is firm. I will marry her. I've committed myself to her. And i will keep it. Y ou are worried because you are her father. Scolding her... in your shoes i too would probably do the same. "Don't worry. If god is in your heart, the truth is resolute." "Don't worry, mansi. Everything will be fine." Y our dad is an artist. Who can understand love better than an artist? Call me later. Please. Where have you been? I've been calling you for so long. - But you don't answer. - Another twist in manav's love story mansi's father has found out that mansi loves me. I mean we're in love. Forget about love and look at this photograph. She's the girl deepmohan and shaku chose for you. But i told her father clearly. And i'll stand by my commitment. But jagmohan has something else planned for you. "This girl belongs to the kurasia family, nishita." I too approve of her. "- The girl has class. - This is not fair, grandma." "After hearing my story too, you show no sympathy." It's pack up for all these girls. I'll have sympathy when you obey me. Okay. Y ou will have to marry the girl i approve of. "No, grandma. This is not fair. Y ou're putting me in a tight corner!" There's this drama going on and you're initiating another one! "I love her to much, grandma. Y ou know how much i love her." Y ou're my grandma. How can you do this to me? First take a look at the picture. "Don't fall in love. Rise, my child." Rise in love. - What are you doing here? - The girls are worried about you. I went to call prabha. - Bombay? - Bombay. I have just one sister prabha in bombay. Y es. What did she advise? What will she say? She said bring mansi over to bombay. She herself will talk to her. Then she will find an answer to this problem. "She also said to come straight, not to inform brother jaggi." - I'm worried. - Will you go to bombay? I can't spend one night here. I will have to go to bombay. Mumbai i'm glad you came to bombay under this pretext. - Where is ashwin? - I divorced him. - Why? - He deserved it. But i have something from him. My tunno! After listening to your story... i have reached one conclusion. Y ou must go to manav mehta's house at 7 in the morning. And shock them. Just give them a surprise. I said sir does not meet anybody today. Tell him i have come from chamba. I'm tarababu. I'm a close friend of his! I don't have orders to telephone or wake up anyone before 9.30. Take a seat on this bench. I'll call at 9.30 or 10. But we won't sit here!! I'm his friend! Only his friends come here. Sit down. Take a seat. "Father, let's sit." A tarababu has come from chamba. - Make him sit out. - All right madam. Come and sit here. Sit down. - We won't sit here. - Why? Can i call up and talk to them? To the master or their son? The master is sleeping and his son is not at home. He has gone to his grandma's house. Since last night. Sit. Brownie... come here. "Y our name brownie, right? - Do you know him?" Y es and he too knows me. Do you see? He knows us! I'll set you right later! "Hello. Shake hand, pal." I'm sure he'll go and tell jagmohan. Brownie. Shut up you. Lock him in the room! Creating a nuisance since morning! Hello. How do you do. How are you? - Welcome. I'll go and talk to him. Deep... thank you so much. Y es. Everything is all right. Go inside. "Excuse me, sir. - See you later on." "- We have come. - Tarababu, when did you come?" When? We're here since 7.30 am! That rascal of a guard! Didrt he tell you? We've been sitting for 6 hours! And tell me where is jagmohan? He's getting dressed. Special guests have come from london. He meets them over lunch. Please be seated. I'll inform him. Make them sit in the shade. Come and sit here. Would you like some tea or water? - Get us some water. - Right. Glade to meet you. - Actually i was waiting for you. I thought you have not received the invitation. Welcome. Y ou've made them sit here? They are not non entities. He is tarababu from chamba. A dear friend of brother. He's come from a distance. Make them sit in the lounge. In air conditioned comfort. "- Y ou came without an appointment. - Sister, we..." y ou've broken the rules of this family "in this house, no one can meet anyone without an appointment." "- Y es, madam? - Seat them inside." Didrt i tell you to call them up? Take a appointment. Did you hear what she said? What appointment? Did they take an appointment to come to our house? What nonsense! Y ou? Get out this room. I say get out. "- No, father. Let's go. - We will leave, my child." We will leave but now we'll see this drama through. Y ou people who perform dramas in every street... have you come here to perform for or watch the mehta family? Y ou have adorned your daughter well to come here. To ensnare the prince of this castle! Sister... i am not a sister to pimps like you! It would be best for you to return home. I won't leave without meeting jagmohan. He's having lunch with the english what will you do there? Wag your tail like a dog? - Aunty. "Let jagmohan come. I'll tell him, the dogs he's tied outside..." he should tie this english bitch along with them! Y ou called me a bitch! How dare you! Throw them out of the house! Tarababu. - Brother... we've been... stop! Stop right there! He called me a bitch! "Uncle, did he say it or not?" - He did... - that's it! First you drop in uninvited. Then you call me sister-in-law... "a bitch! Y es, i called her a bitch!" Because your sister-in-law behaved like a bitch. "Y es, tarababu from chamba." "Y our friend, you brother!" Y ou too may say something against me if you wish. Go ahead! Y ou're not in the right state of mind. Go home now. We'll talk in the office tomorrow. - Finally you too said it! - Y es i did. Now you please go. Go. Didrt even offer us water! Didrt offer his pal a seat! Terrific! Y ou came to our house as an important guest. With a statue of mother saraswati! Lofty talks! Artists are a form of god! " greater than us, the wealthy!" Y ou are a very sentimental man. "We call every man in a band, an artist." They come wagging their tails once you show them a note. Saraswati means nothing. Y ou are sycophants of wealth! Y ou drool at the sight of money. "Only talk big! If you want to be compensated for your work, sure..." - and get lost! - Y ou are right. And the fact is that i want to be compensated. And i want it right now. Tell me how much money you want. "Y ou rascal! - Don't touch me, you rascal!" Y ou toyed with my emotions! - Now i got paid for it! - Stop it! I say stop it! What are you doing? Son... - what is going on here? Y ou hit my father! Do you know what you've done! Nobody dared to say one insulting word to him! And you slapped him! - Son... - y ou have turned mad! Go away from here. Lest i raise my hand too! Leave! Raise your hand. Beat my father. He did not show respect to my dad. Y our father has honour and my father has none? Y ou are all alike. Only wealthy. - Rich statues. - Do you want to leave? Then leave. But i can't let anyone insult my father or family. My father means everything to me! "- Do you understand? - Y es, i understand." And now you too understand this. Here is your love! And here is your gift! What will i tell prabha? Father... y ou don't cry. "Let's sit there, father." Sit here. My heart is restless i eagerly watch the path "my heart is restless and i eagerly look at the path..." "life is miserable... no music appeals to me" "so come to me, my love..." let's make music together let's make music together i knew they would treat you this way. But how could i give sight to your blind love? I had just one way that you see for yourself. The world has really gone places. Wasrt it better that everything happened so fast? "Y eah! That's right, mansi." Life comes in chapters. One ends and the other begins. "Mama, your card. - What is this?" Vikrant entertainment company. Where did you find this? Father had it. Whose card is this? - Vikrant entertainment company. - We met this man in a stadium. - Y ou met him? What did he say? - Nothing. He recognised me. He came up to me and asked if i was tarababu. He had heard a lot of my songs on the radio. My photo had appeared in the paper... last month? - Y es. He had seen that. All right. - He was praising me a lot. He asked me to come to his studio at 11 on monday. - Then? - I said i'd come. - But who goes! - Brother! Do you know who this man is? "For me, he's a thief. Plagiarizing my song!" I don't believe this. This is vikrant kapur. The top star of hue television industry. Go and wear your clothes first. Such a big man invites you to his studio and you want to go to chamba! This is wrong. Y ou should go to his studio at least once! Who knows what door fate might open for you! "The truth is that vikrant has 4 eyes, not 2." "Two in front, two at the back." That is how he sees everything. Go there. He must have seen you with the rear eyes and called you. Go ahead. Good luck. I'm prabha shankar. Tv reporter. I'm tarababu's cousin. I recognised him the moment i set eyes on him. I compose my music myself. But in every corner of this country is hidden folk talent... ...which my company discovers. Y ou sing your songs for jalandhar radio. But we listen them here. "We record those songs, remix them and earn millions." Remix? By remix i mean you catch a song composed by anyone. Or steal it. Then add 4 new instruments to it. Record and remix them and lay your stake to it. Art is art whether it be yours or others'. The goddess of wealth should be with you. Tip-toes all the way. Hello vikrant. "Sir sadbud! How are you, sir?" Y ou're rarely seen! The papers are full of news about you! Y our name is embedded in my heart! "Sure you must meet me. It is your studio, sir!" Right now i'm in a board meeting. Call me in half an hour. Okay. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. Bye. "If this scoundrel calls up again, tell him i'm not in the studio." Y ou must be thinking what a fraud i am! But this is the language of our business. We talk with love at our enemies and fight with friends. They are new so they don't understand the tongue of bombay. Don't you speak? What can i say? Say that again. What can i say? What can i say? What a phrase! Good voice too. Do you sing? She sings better than me. - And do you dance? She's a graduate in dance. And song. That means i was right. I was right in thinking and... my guess was right that here is a star of chamba. "This is my friend, confidante, secretary, manager, partner..." "and the main executor of this company, banerjee." Sutarbhai has come from baroda for the charity show. I'll deal with him now. Tell him we're booked all year. One show will cost 50 lakhs. No charity. We'll work only when he pays up. Take your own limit. Okay. This charity business is a fraud! They make money and ask us artists for concessions! "I have told him, tarababu. I'm a man of the 21 st century." "Whether it's a marriage, party or award function..." pay up and i'll make music! Tarababu... we artists are priceless! I'm very happy to know you respect artists so much. I wish to respect you with all my heart. "But honestly, emotional people scare me a lot." Y ou must first learn to be practical. "- That's what i tell them. - For example, take..." y ou've always remained poor and will always remain poor. Y ou sang in the mountains and we made remixes and earned millions! Take a look. This contains songs composed only by you! "I'm trying to tell you, join our company." "Write songs for us, mansi can sing..." and be a model dancer in our shows. Begin a new life. Simple. Give us 2 days to think. "Sure, think it over. Y ou may reject our accept our company offer." Thinking like this won't help. Y ou are a girl of the 21 st century. Simpering away at home won't help. Y ou've seen what language the men of today use. Think with your head. What will you achieve by returning to chamba? Make a mockery of yourself? The burden of marrying 2 sisters? A heavy with debt school of your dad? How will you yourself live? How? How??? I have no idea of your past. "But it's very essential for you to experience pain, sorrow for success." Y ou also seem to have suffered quite a bit. Y es. Y ou are right. I have suffered like the hero of hindi films... ...whose father left his mother when he was a child. My mother sewed and got me an education. Taught me music. And then she died. The same sad story. This is my mother. She left behind some principles of the 20th century. Here it is. Principles of the 20th century. Sacrifice is supreme. "Do good and forget about it. Do your duty, don't expect rewards." "After completing b.a., i worked on these ideals for 5 years." "What was the outcome? I starved, had no food to eat." I used to play this rattle. And banerjee would take photographs. Then our life took a new turn. We met a man called jaidev uncle. He gave us these 7 tenets of the 21 st century. 7 commandments. "He said kapu, change these old tenets." Change into a modern man. The first rule is love remains healthy with give and take. Give and take. First do good to yourself. Me first. All efforts are useless unless backed with expectation of reward. What is the profit? What is desire? What's the result? Shop dressing is more important than honesty. Business. Envy is essential to win in any competition. Jealousy! Greed is necessary to become rich. Cut the others down to size in order to be one up. Cut it. Cut into size. I followed them for 7 years and... ...turned into vikrant kapur from kapu. Y ou mean you really turned out to be practical. This is bombay. Everything is a show. It's called showmanship. The decoration is publicity and the dressing is marketing. Now you will see where we take mansi. Only if she clears the test. Tell her the company contract rules. Y ou have to give a video test and sing. - What's the other condition? - The other condition is... y ou can't get married during this period. - Pardon...? - No marriage... "no friendship, nor love or romance." We sell pain not buy it. "Manav, at least listen to what deepmohan is saying." He may say anything but the staff told me everything. Shaku aunt is at fault. And at issue is the honour of the family. I see. So you will teach us civilised behaviour! Absolutely. How should a wealthy man behave with a poor man... y ou have to learn that. The tarababu who was treated as a king in chamba... he was made to sit with the dogs. The one they said was saraswati incarnate... was called a slave of laxmi? "9 hours! For 9 hours, grandma father and daughter sat in the sun." Somebody who was humiliated in this manner... what would he do if not boil over with anger? What is your point? In 2 days daddy will return from london. Y ou will have to clearly tell dad of the way you behaved with them. What do we tell brother? Somebody slaps him and he should quietly bear it! No! We'll not tolerate this nonsense. Any nonsense. Do you understand mr manav. If breaking a glass or raising your voice proves the truth... then i have broken 7 glasses. That implies my truth is 7 times stronger than yours. I'll explain the real truth. When a 21 year old boy gets blinded by love... this is just the way he behaves. Then he wants to change not just his but the fate of the family. We won't let you change the fate of the entire family. Fate has changed. Y our manav now belongs to another. Take a look if you'd like. This is manav's mansi. She will be the daughter-in-law of this family. And someday all of you'll be taking a family photograph around her. That's my promise to you. To you. Y ou and you. "Grandma, may i leave?" Oh beloved... "i understand it now... i understand the feeling" "y ou were confused earlier; your predicament is now solved" she's got something. She's good. "Y es, sign the contract." Cut... "hey man! Man, i'm talking to you." Y ou are in front of my heroine. Please move away. Y ou... slightly loose nut. "Mister, we're working." Please stand behind the public. "Look, i must meet mansi." Mansi? Do you know her? "Y es, very closely." How is she related to you? Beloved. Pardon? My beloved. Just a minute. "Mansi. - Y es, sir." Do you see that boy? He says he wants to meet you. Y ou're his beloved. - Is it a fact? - No sir. Neither am i anyone's beloved nor do i want to see him. - Shall i tell him that? - Y es sir. "Final. - Y es, sir." "Brother, she says she neither wants to meet you..." nor does she know you nor is she your beloved. Understand. I have to meet her. Meet her after the shooting. I'm acting like a gentleman. Y ou too act like one. Please go there. Let us work. Please. Start sound. "Mansi, stop." I can guess your sorrow. I have made a mistake. I respect you even more after finding out the truth. Do you know why? Because a girl who holds the honour of her parents higher than her love... sacrifices her love for their honour... only that girl can be the wealth of a family. She can be a good wife to a man. I've come to apologise to you. Y our father should apologise to my father! "Because he slapped him? No, that was wrong." Absolutely wrong. I respect my father just as you respect yours. "Mansi, it's done. The job is done!" Vikrant says the contract will be signed today. Today is an auspicious day. I've read the contract. Just sign it. - Just do it. Come on. - Come on. Y ou are vikrant's heroine for three years from today. The star of... - tomorrow. Sign here. Y ou threw these in my house. I'll string them into a necklace once again. And you will have to wear it. "If god resides in me, i am honest..." y ou yourself will come running into my arms someday. Y ou... on your own. "- So, met her? - Y es." Decision taken? - Y es. - What? She signed you on and resigned me. "She turned you down? - Y es, she turned me down." "Look friend, i don't know your story but i do know this..." the girls and boys who enter the world of stardom hang in the sky. Stars in the sky. They never come down to earth. We are beyond already my friend. Y ou probably don't know the girl. She will come and to me alone. And you will send her to me. "- Me...? - Y es, you." I'm businessman. After all business. Y ou will send her as a businessman. "One thing is sure, i love your self-confidence." And good luck. - Y eah. Manav. "Welcome back, daddy. - Is what you said to deep true?" Absolutely true. These people humiliated tarababu and mansi. That was wrong. That is why he humiliated you. That too was wrong. But... it is also true... "y es, carry on." I love mansi. I've promised to marry her. What will you do now? Will you leave home? Call us names? No. No... that will never happen. Something that sullies your family or your name... i will never do that. "No scenes, no pettiness. No violence" i will neither leave you nor elope and marry mansi. That is my promise to you. Good. If i refuse to let you marry mansi...? Y ou won't do that. No. Y ou won't do it. The love of mansi and me bloomed under your web. It grew. The only difference is that you loved tarababu like a businessman... and i loved mansi like a man. Like a human being. This won't happen. Mansi will not come to this house. No... never. All right. If my love is not true... she will never come. But if god resides in my heart... if i am honest... if my love is true... y ou yourself will bring mansi to this house. Y ou... and it will happen. Not anymore... "no, not anymore, my love..." i can take it no more "the nightingale sings in the forests..." "a fire breaks out... i don't care" "a snake bites me... i wouldn't care" "even if the skies fall... i wouldn't care" "i wouldn't care if any calamity happened" "but i'd never be able to bear the pain of my broken-heart" "come now, my beloved" "do come now, my beloved" "the heart sees no reason" every moment passes by... but the heartache remains "even if he has forgotten everything, i do remember so much" "the plant that the vines engulf, withers away" "where it hoped for roses... it is left with thorns" "no medicine, no prayer can ever save you from love" love is unfaithful "without it, however, you are ionely" "do not give your heart, they advise; and they give their hearts away" "they steal your sleep; and keep you awake all nights" "happiness and cheer, they are for someone else" "no promise, no effort works then" "this is one of the worst afflictions" an extra-ordinary story of special success of an extra-ordinary girl. "...of mansi shankar, whom you will meet at the mtv party tonight." Welcome to mtv indian music viewers choice award. We're here in search of a star. The search ends right here. Because we have mansi... from the winner of the mtv viewers choice award. "The day i saw mansi, in 5 minutes i had understood..." she will be the greatest star of the world! I'm grateful to kenstar for giving this honour. Kenstar makes a star that as mansi. I watched mtv but never dreamt my song would be on top of its' charts. Then what did you dream about? That was another dream. Mtv has given us this honour today. I'm really excitement and cool. Twice the amount of blood is pumping through my veins! Manav is here. I'm very excited. Now six times the amount of blood is flowing in my veins! Brother... - hello hi. "- Y ou and here? - Y es, i'm here." - How come? - I came just as you came. Are you too a kenstar winner? Not yet but maybe i'll be lucky. May i talk to you for a minute? - Sure. "Frankly pal, i like you a lot." I too am fond of you. Y ou are interesting man. "But y our highness, y our majesty..." mtv has thrown such a grand party in our honour. And you landed up again to ruin it in the form of a lover! Do you like this? Not a form of lover. I am a lover. - Whose lover? - Hers. "Look, this is a business party." It's the first day of her success. - That is why i have come. Like a gentleman i request you to sneak away from here. Please. I told you mansi belongs to me and i belong to mansi. - That is why i have come. - But she refuses to acknowledge you. "Sir, she's in a temper! Y ou do fight in love." So you are fully convinced that she will return to you? "Y es, cent percent. And you will send her to me." Banerjee... he is a mad guy. He is became mad. He is crazy. Show him the way out. Ladies and gentlemen... tonight is for mansi shankar! And the chief guest tonight is... "a young, a dashing and handsome guy..." mr manav mehta. I like to request manav mehta... to give away the kenstar trophy prizes the star of the year. On behalf of all student to mansi shankar. The only son of the chairman of mehta and mehta company. He won the maximum awards in his college in london. Not only in indian music but in indian literature. "Well a great indian, from great britain." Manav mehta. Interesting situation. I like it. The mtv guys invited him here as chief guest. Where are the drinks? - Drinks? Y ou don't want to be this. Y ou are manavsi. "Say it. Say, you don't love me." No. But don't live this false life. Please. Shall i leave? I'll wait for you. Bye. "Sir, your comment on this please." I'm really very excited. I'm freeze. Now my blood is flowing 12 times faster! Any more question. "Take a meter reading, vivek. Y es, perfect." - Y our beloved was saying... - i don't want to hear it. That's not happening. It's very simple. Go like this. And attitude. "Whatever it be, he has class." Y ou want have some? - No thanks. I met prabha. She told me all about manav. Y ou should make friends with him. What's the harm in it? Parents are always the villains in love. He's in love with you. Enough! Stop it! It's very important that i remind you at this point... "according to your company contract, no artist of your company..." "...has the right to make friends, fall in love or get married!" Y ou are raising obstacles in my work and career with your talk! I don't like working like this! I don't want to work here! I don't want to work! She's a wounded lioness. Why do you trouble her? "I'm impress, banerjee." In today's world you find arrogant girls not self respecting ones.
