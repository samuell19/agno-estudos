[ambient music] [smooth music] [birds singing] [Jimmy groans and laughs] Am I in bed? -Leave me here. -Come on. Give me a bloody moment. My son, come on. Up you get. [Jimmy singing] What the bloody hell's this? That's your ear muffs. [Billy laughing] You're gonna need them when you get in bed with Maureen. [Jimmy singing drunkenly] [birds singing] [vacuum cleaner humming] -Morning, Maureen. -Morning, Ruby. -Where is it? -What? -My husband. -Over here, snoring. Jimmy! Good night were it, Mr. Hardcastle? It were fantastic. [dog barking] Rudy, leave. Germs, we don't know where he's been. [dog barking] Who is she? [Jimmy] She's no one. You're a liar! She's a size double D, you dirty swine! I wasn't out enjoying myself, Maureen. I was out on business. Oh, aye. What kind of business? -Show business. -Oh, give over! I met a man, Maureen. A business associate. He'll supply me the lot. A fun filled package. What are you talking about? You'll find out soon enough. I'm gonna turn this piss pot into a palace. [Jimmy burps] [jackhammer drilling] Take that poster down, Jimmy! We're not having it! Oh yes we are. You can't go wrong with a pair of tits, a pie and a pint, they're a winning formula. They'll bring in all sorts. I don't give a tinker's toss, so long as they're paying. It's what men want. What about us women? You're barred. Saturday nights is men only. I am not standing behind this bar, while some woman shows off all she's got. She's only got what you've got, more or less. Yes, and mine's me own. It's private. This is a public house, not an whorehouse. We're not having it, Jimmy. I won't play second fiddle to a load of minge winkers. Oh yes, you will. * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday Mr. President * * Happy birthday to you * Bad Billy, he's impressed. Ta. Come here. Have you had much experience, Tina? Last Christmas I starred in pantomime. [Billy whistles] Oh, yes. What did you play? -Dick Whittington's cat. -Yeah, yeah. It doesn't surprise me. I can see it in your movements, feline. I made the costume myself. Really? I like it, it's creative. Have you still got it? Dick Whittington, his cat? -Costume? -Aye. I keep it hung up on a wire coat hanger. I want you to bring it Saturday night. I've got a new venue for you. [upbeat music] Right, well you best pull those chairs back, 'cause when I drop my knickers, and start to wriggle my paraphernalia, I don't want anyone to get singed. Hot act, are you? I do it with fire, it's my speciality. Fantastic! Ta. Oh, and I'll need a bucket of water. What for? [Sheena] I got to damp down my thingy, it's obligatory. Right, I'll leave you to get on with it then. Oh, and watch my husband, he has a roving eye. I don't want you getting any funny contemplations. Well, there's no chance of that love. Why not? -I'm a dyke! -[toilet flushes] Hello. I'm Tina, the glamour pussy. [she purrs softly] -Mr. Hardcastle. -Mr. Bowmans, how do? What you drinking? -Gin. -Run along, Sandra. -Where do I go, Billy? -Signoritas, pink door, love. Give it a good show, darlin'. The full Monty. Who is she? [Billy] It's me girlfriend. [men cheering and whistling] Impressive. They won't be doin' that when they see her. She's past it. Used to be a cracker years ago. Best on the circuit. Once upon a time, she could stretch it like elastic, -but now- -She's got a nice arse. -Yeah. -Juicy. I've seen better. Very impressed with this, Mr. Hardcastle. I reckon we do good business together. What am I gonna do, Sandra? Look, you get out there and don't let them smell it. -Pardon? -Fear! How do I do that? You fix your face on. [men cheering and shouting] [upbeat music] [man whistling] I know that face. I've seen her somewhere before. It's not the face I'm looking at. With all that makeup, she's a lot older than she used to be. Sandra! It's Sandra from school! Sandra Delaney! Maureen Crump! What are you doing up there? What do you think she's bleeding doing? Oh shut up, sweaty arse! -Maureen! -Sandra! [they scream] [dog barking] Last time I saw you, Sandra Delaney, you had your legs wrapped round the schoolboy's handlebars, he was taking you for a ride. Aye, he's been taking me for a ride ever since. -Who? -Billy Bowmans. Never! You married him> Bad Billy Bowmans? -No, we got engaged. -How long for? 25 years. He promised me a wedding, but nothing much materialised, except for his baby. You've got a baby? Did have, Robbie. He's almost a man now. What about you? Got married. -Got no children though. -Ah, sorry. I'm not. Got myself a dog instead. -Say hello to my little Rudy. -Ah. Oh, yeah! * Fire * * To destroy all you've done * * Fire * * To end all you've become * * I'll feel you burn * [men cheering and shouting] Here, you've done all right for yourself, Maureen. Your very own pub, landlady. Must be really proud. Who wants to stand behind a bar pulling pints for a living? Better than standing on stage showing off your fanny, eh? That's true. I'm thankful for small mercies. I don't know how you manage it, Sandra. And I used to be good at it. Stripping? Billy first suggested it years ago. Oh, I might have known he'd have something to do with it. Bad Billy Bowmans. Sex mad. At school, his voice had hardly broken and he were at it. Yes, yes! Come on, girl! Show 'em what you've got. Yes! [men shouting and leering] Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, come on, give her a chance. You're all right. When she's got 'em off, she looks fantastic. [men clapping] [men booing and whistling] -Did he do you? -Did he buggery! -I was saving myself. -What for? -My honeymoon. -Was it worth it? Can't remember. The day of my wedding, it rained. Does he love you? -Who? -Your husband! -My Jimmy? -Yeah. Course he loves me, what kind of question is that, Sandra Delaney? He married me, didn't he? Sorry. [she sighs] Hey, we were good friends, weren't we, Maureen? Oh aye, we were. Best of friends, Sandra. We were like sisters. Soul sisters. Aye, soul sisters, girl. Once upon a time. Where's it all gone, Maureen? I dunno, Sandra. Life. What did I tell you? Bleedin' gold mine. Do I get some of that? Doubt it. You've got your housekeeping. My hair wants doing. Nick yourself a wig from Oxfam. I'm your wife, Jimmy. What's that got to do with it? Share and share alike. What's mine is yours. Remember them vows? [he sighs] Tight arse. You all right, Mom? [she sighs] He never loved me, you know. How do you know? 'Cause he wouldn't marry me. [Robbie] That doesn't mean anything. It does to me, Robbie. [gentle music] -Curtsy! -Pardon? It's the morphine, we've upped it, you best do as he says. Curtsy! He thinks he's royalty, Her Majesty the Queen. You've got a visitor, Your Majesty. I do not wish to see her! -Who? -Princess Diana. It's not Princess Diana, Your Royal Highness. It's Maureen. Your niece. Maureen? Remember? I've not long left, dear. I need to talk to you. I've left you the lot under the bed. He's rambling. At home. You what? It's in my Jerry. Bye, bye, love. It's been nice knowing you. I'm going. God bless. [solemn funeral music] For as much as it had pleased almighty God to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, Albert Mosley, dear deceased. We therefore commit his body to the ground. [he clears his throat] We therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Goodbye, Albert. Goodbye, Albert. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ, who should change our vile body, that it may be like unto His glory body. [harp music] What's up with you? Nothing, I've just had a flash. [gentle guitar music] I see you standing alone, reaching for the moon. I see the man in the moon. The man in the moon, he's wearing a golden jockstrap. The golden jockstrap is stuffed! -What with? -Money. Thousands and thousands of pounds. The man in the moon is winking and gesticulating. He points to his golden jockstrap. God save us! The man in the moon is naked! He has removed his golden jockstrap. -Why? -I've no idea. It must be symbolic. [ethereal music] God bless you, Uncle Albert. [Albert] I've left you the lot, under the bed. It's in my Jerry. [she laughs] It's a pot of gold! ["Hallelujah Chorus" by Handel] [she continues laughing] * Hallelujah * * Hallelujah * * Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah * * Hallelujah * * Hallelujah * And now, for Maureen's crowning glory. -Ooh! -Oh! * Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah * What's do you say, Maureen? I'm filling up! What brought about your transformation, Maureen? -I come into a bit of money. -You be careful, Maureen. Look at the lottery, money, it doesn't always bring you happiness. No, but it can change your bleedin' life though. [they all laugh] Here he is everybody, my grandson. [All] Aw! -Oh, he's beautiful. -Oh, so's your hair! Thank you. -How you feeling, girl? -Oh fine. It just slipped out once I got my legs parted. [they laugh] Aren't you lucky! They had me up in stirrups until Shrove Tuesday. He wouldn't budge! [they laugh] Well done, love. [ethereal harp music] [Woman] What's up, Maureen? I keep on getting flashes. Eh? Fetch her a glass of water, now. -Who's that? -He's my new window cleaner. [soft rock music] -Are you all right, Maureen? -Yeah, I'm fine. Don't bear thinking about does it? What? Squeezing his shammy! [they laugh] Hey, that reminds me, you're all coming tonight? Wedding's been put back till I can walk properly. -But I'm still having it. -What? Me hen party. [they all cheer and laugh] [upbeat music] [door slams] What's the matter with her? Mom's upset. What's upset her? You have. Oh, shit! Come on Sandra, it doesn't mean anything. It's just sex. It's you that I want. It's you that I need. It's you that I love. * Roll me over * * In the clover * * Roll me over in the clover do it again * Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Sing a song! Did you see him, that last stripper? -Way-aye! -Oh my God! I'd have given him one. Hey, hey! -You're going to be a- -What! That were a man, that's what I call a man. * Roll me over in the clover do it again * [they shout and laugh] What time do you call this? Where the bloody hell have you been? I've been out! Enjoying myself. Bloody looks like it. What's that on your head? It's my new hair piece. [Jimmy] Oh, it's a friggin' jockstrap, you dirty bitch! Yes, and it's given me ideas. Come here, I want to proposition you! Get off, bloody hell! You're squashing me, you fat sod! Get off, you're giving me a hernia. Jimmy, I want it. You're not getting it. No, listen, a ladies night, male strippers, in our pub. What'd you say? -No chance. -Why not? The punters, they won't stand for it. Not while they're drinking. They'll stand for women doing it. That's different. A woman's decorative. Her what-not's self-contained. I want a ladies night, Jimmy. You're not getting it. -Right! -Bloody hell. If that's your sodding attitude, I'll have one myself, I'll arrange it myself! -Aye, what with? -With my money! [Jimmy] What money? You haven't got any bloody money. Oh yes I have. [Jimmy] Where from? Bingo. [upbeat music] [doorbell rings] -Maureen. -Sandra, can I talk to you? Yeah, what's the matter? [upbeat rock music] Can you see what I can see? What's happening? We are going into show business. Show business? To the side, to the side, come on Terry, Bosco, and swirl those hips. One and two and, one and two and. You better put a stop to it, Jimmy, lad. You can't have Maureen and Sandra moving into our domain. Male strippers? Bad publicity. As what? A gay's pub. When word gets out you're entertaining male nudes, they'll be sniffing around your toilet cubicles like a pack of puffed up poodles. [Jimmy] Bollocks. -Exactly. -Maureen! Oh hey up, here he comes, Lord and master. Right, that's it! All this girly behaviour, it can bleedin' well stop. -Who says? -I say! I'm in charge here. It's my name hangs over that door. I'm the king of this castle. Well, not up here you're not. Saturday nights, I'm taking over this function room. Up here, it's gonna be women only and I'm calling it the Golden Garter. The Golden Garter? What the bloody hell's that, then? It's a candlelit supper with a full frontal floor show. Who's put this idea into your daft head, eh? Hey, the man on the moon? He could say that, couldn't he, Sandra? [upbeat music] [women screaming] [Woman] Tell me it's not true, Justin. Of course it's true. I've got a witness. He's a rams bottom, she'll testify. I don't believe it. He was seen up the landlady's podium. He revealed himself provocatively. Just like a peacock. I should be back on my tablets, Charlie. You're not doing it, lad. I am doing it, Mom. [All] Justin, Justin, we love Justin! Justin, Justin, we love Justin! Justin, Justin, we love Justin! -Jesus! -What's going on? We're being besieged, Lily. Who by? Sex maniacs! [women screaming] [All] We love Justin, Justin.

Animal magic. [they laugh hysterically] [car horn beeping] [she moans] It's lunchtime blow outs Billy. Oh God, oh, we're gonna have to stop. Why? 'Cause it ruins me hair. I've got my reputation to think about, Billy. -[she moans] -[door bell dings] -Ooh, sister! -You in the back? Oh, hello, Maureen. What can I do for you? We've come for works. The full beauty treatment. [they cheer] It's disgusting. And 1965 was the start of it. I couldn't get my hair set without interference. It all went unisex. [upbeat music] Who's a pretty boy, then? [she laughs] [he screams] That's it girl, make a new man out of him, hey? -What's going on in there? -It's your Terry, he's in with Tiffany. What's she doin' to him? She's waxing his chest and his bikini line. [he screams] Oh, give over, you soft sod! We women go through that routine once a month! [they laugh] How long do you have to tan? Oh love, what you doing inside there? I'm a sex object. Get away, you're not old enough. I remember helping his mother change his nappy. I used to put him across me knee, sprinkle his bottom with talcum powder. Aye, you can do it again Saturday night for £19.99. You coming, girls? Opening night, Golden Garter? [women chattering excitedly] [upbeat music] * Party time * [car horn beeping] Oh, yes. I'm very impressed, Maureen, with what I can see. Bugger off, you filthy swine, I'm relieving myself. I like it. -You've got balls. -I beg your pardon? Ooh, ooh you are sitting on a goldmine, darling, and I'd like some of it. Get out of my toilet! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Dirty man's a cesspit. Hey. Times have changed, Maureen. How's it going upstairs, hey? Playing about with boys? I am not playing about, Billy Bowmans. -I am deadly serious. -Good. Because, Maureen, there's summat I want to show you. What are you doing? You need a man, Maureen. What for? To show you how to do it. Do what? This.

What do you say? Tell you what I say, Billy Bowmans. I've already got a partner, and her name's Sandra. [gentle guitar music] [Fortune Teller] What is your wish, my child? Oh, I wish to know the future. What does it behold for me and Billy? May this rune, now enchanted, let the second sight be granted. You shall have his child, wear his ring and live happily ever after. But I've already had his child. You shall have another. A baby boy. Ooh. He loves me. -Ooh, you look gorgeous. -You trying to be funny? [car horn beeping] Give over! People'll think I'm on the game or summat. -Come on, get in the car. -No chance, I'm a married woman. [Billy] What's that got to do with it? Everything. Maureen? Get in the car. -Come on. -[dog groans] Oh, you're not doing it right, Robbie. It's wiggle, waggle, turn, turn, drop 'em. I'm not allowed to drop 'em during my solo. Why not? Maureen says she's serving chicken in the basket. Oh heck, look at the time. I have to go and get my kecks on. What's got into you? Your father's going to. If my prediction's come right. Oh, Billy! * I'm in the mood for love * A rose sir, for your lady? -Give her the bucket. -Oh, Billy. Hey, my treat. Oh no, it's expensive. Keep the change. Oh, Billy. I've never been given a bucket of roses. Very symbolic. What, the bucket? -No, a rose. -Oh yeah, yeah. What does it remind you of? Oh, a flower? Reminds me of a woman. Her sexual parts. Why have you brought me here, Billy? You're a very attractive woman, Maureen. Oh, aye. And I wasn't born yesterday. I remember you at school. You're always after summat. And what is it you want? I want you and your boys. I thought of a stage name for them. Oh aye, what's that? -The Rude Boys. -Oh, The Rude Boys. We can take them all the way to the top, Maureen. Me and you together. I know some people. Some very big people. Oh aye, and who's that? Mr. Belafonte. What, Harry Belafonte? He's an agent. A very big agent. He can fix up any venue from Bolton to Blackpool. * Fever * * When you kiss me, fever when you * * You're givin' me fever * Oh, stop it! Billy! You're ticklin'!

Oh Billy, oh Billy. Billy, come out from under that table, now. * Fever * Do you want a pudding? Oh, oh! We've not quite decided. Billy's just havin' another look. Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Billy's going to- Yours, I believe. Come on, Maureen. Put me out of my misery. Me, you and The Rude Boys. [Maureen] Oh, that's not a Harry Belafonte recording. Harry, Harry sang- * Day-oh, day-oh * * Daylight come and me want to go- * [Maureen] No, that was somebody else. I'm just talking to Shirley Bassey. Hello, Shirley, love. Aye, Saturday night, the Starlight Ballroom. Can you do it for me? Good. -Ice or soda? -No, number nine bus to the terminal, then you can walk from there. Aye, and it's cash in hand. Lovely. Mr. Belafonte, he represents all the stars. -Brad Pitt, Sharon Stone. -Oh, come on. Arnie Schwarzenegger. You name 'em, I represent 'em. It's a new idea of mine. Look alikeys. -What do you think? -Dead impressed. I thought you would be, lad. Right, lad, let's get down to business, yeah. Mr. Belafonte, The Rude Boys. We've come to discuss representation. Representation? No, no, lad. I've represented them male strippers before. And I'll tell you, it was a nice little earner in the old days, a few bob, but not anymore, lad. The bottom's fallen right out of it. -I'm not interested. -You're not? -I'm not. -Mr Belafonte's right, Billy. Them Chippendale male groups, they're all alike. Trussed up turkeys with all Brussels sprouts, aren't they? Shut up, Maureen. Just wait a minute. Our group, Mr. Belafonte, it's different. How different? -They're not men. -Not men? What the bloody hell are they? -They're boys. -Boys? How old? -Old enough. -What for? -Titillation. -Who for? Us women. -Is it legal? -Oh, aye. For years, you men have ogled young girls, Mr. Belafonte. Well, now, it's time for us women to have a look. And the Golden Garter is the place to see it. See what? -Boys' bare bottoms. -Oh, lovely! Boys' bare bottoms? Is there much call for this round here? See for yourself, we're sold out. We're open Saturday night. * Humidity's risin' * * Barometer's gettin' low * * According to all sources * Maureen doesn't want to talk about it, all right? -She's decided. -Since when? Since I said. What about me? She never asked me. Maureen doesn't have to ask you. She's the landlady. She pays the wages, she can do what she likes. But me and her were partners. No, not anymore you're not. Sandra! Sandra, I'm sorry. I've got to think what's best for business. [Sandra] I thought we were friends. We are friends, Sandra. Nothing much changes. Oh great. Ta, I'm really grateful for that. Don't make it any more difficult for me, Sandra. I need Billy's professional experience. I'm sorry. What do you look like, eh? Queen of shite. Oh, that's nice, that's nice. Oh, nice, now come on. Cross the ball. Yes! Come on, go on! Yes, goal! Give me that. Come here, give it back here. Give! Why don't you ever do that to me? 'Cause you haven't got her face or her figure. I don't have to put up with this! [gentle music] What are you doing, Maureen? Living a lie, Billy. You look like a ghost. I am a ghost. Been haunting myself for years. Can I come in? I need somewhere to kip. -Sandra's locked me out. -Maureen, get up here! Shift that fat arse! I'll sleep on the sofa, Maureen, anyway, you know. You won't have to sleep on my sofa, Billy. Get in and drive. [car engine starts] [gentle music] [thunder rumbles] [he whistles] -It's a palace! -Oh, aye. Uncle Albert, he lived like a queen. Jimmy knows nothing about it. Not told him. This house, it's my secret. Uncle Albert and Uncle George. Such a lovely couple. They worshipped each other. What like, brothers? No, friends. What sort of friends? Special friends. They lived together for 50 years. Their rings. Love rings. Moonstones. Did they get married? No, don't be soft, they met in 1942, it were illegal. -Yeah. -Oh, no. Their world was a secret kingdom. Fairyland. Fairyland. What's the matter, Maureen? Nothing. I'm just upset. Uncle Albert and Uncle George. They both found it. What? Love. Why can't I? You can. Oh yes, you can. [thunder rumbles] -Oh, Billy. -It's all right, Maureen, -it's all right. -Yeah. Oh, Maureen. Oh, Billy. [bed pan clanging] -What's that? -Oh, it's Uncle Albert's chamber pot. He were addicted. He had to go every day. Where? The bingo. Bloody hell. It's all mine, Billy. £10,000. Oh, Maureen. -[she laughs] -Oh my God. [thunder cracking] [Maureen laughs] -Sorry. -It's all right, -it's all right. -£10,000. Oh, you! [they laugh] And it's all Maureen's. And it's all- [thunder cracking] Oh no, oh, Billy! Oh, heck. -He's got your eyes. -He's got your ears. -He's got your mouth. -He's got your nose. Yeah. Our son. Baby Keanu. Oh! Will you marry me? Why? Because I love you. * Barometer's getting low * * According to all sources * * The street's the place to go * * 'Cause tonight for the first time * * Just about half past 10 * * For the first time in history * * It's gonna start raining men * * Start raining men * * It's raining men * * Hallelujah it's raining men * * Amen * * I'm gonna go out * * I'm gonna let myself get * * Absolutely soaking wet * * It's raining men * * Hallelujah it's raining men * * Every specimen * * Tall, blonde, dark and mean * * Rough and tough and strong and lean * * It's raining men * * Hallelujah it's raining men * * Amen * * It's raining men * * Hallelujah it's raining men * * Amen * * Wait for the thunder don't you * Two, three, four.

It's the end of dress rehearsal. -It's not a competition, Dad. -He's all right, your Dad. [phone ringing] [Man] It's bloody uncomfortable, innit? -Yeah? -It's Maureen. I am so excited. Saturday night, we're gonna shoot to the moon. Mr. Belafonte, he'll be mesmerised. Billy, come up here, darlin'. I've got so much I want to show you. I want to give it you up here on this plank. I've wrapped it specially. What? Prezzie. Let's go. It's all yours, Billy. Forever and ever. -What do you say? -How much? -Pardon? -No, I- Is it valuable? Well yes, it is to me. It were Uncle Albert's moonstone. Oh, ciggies. [bright romantic music] Key to fairyland. Do you want it? Yeah. How much? Show me how much. [tense music] What? What's your problem? Eh? You know what's my problem! It's Maureen. -She's on the chain. -Oh, God. Has she seen a doctor? It's not hormonal, Bowmans. It's mental. She started the thing for her bloody self, she'll think I haven't noticed. What's got into her? You have. You're a fast mover, I'll give you that. You've got to be in the glamour business, Jimmy. You know what I mean? You've got to keep abreast of the times. Aye, whose breasts? Oh, come on. Me and Maureen, we've got a good business relationship. That's all. I know. Just you remember, she's my wife, right? Can't blame me for that, Jimmy. What's her business is mine. Exactly, and on Saturday, she's gonna make you a bloody fortune. No, no, she's not, because I'm not having it. This is my pub. I'm not having you and her cavorting behind my back. -Saturday night's off. -What? [Jimmy] Sling your hook. -You can't. -I can. I'm the bloody landlord here, remember? I've got Belafonte coming. Yeah. I don't care if you've got the queen of England coming. You're up to summat, now sod off.

What are you trying to tell me? They're having it off. Who's having it off? Dad and Maureen! -I saw them both. -What! [Robbie] He had her up in the air suspended. -You're a liar. -I'm not lying.

[gentle music] Well, I don't know why you've stuck -with her for so long, Billy. -Baby. I felt sorry for her. It's you that I feel sorry for, Billy willy. You're wasting your life on the likes of that. Sandra's past it. You can tell by her hair. It's all dried up. It's true. It is.

[Audience] Ooh! -Judas! -Maureen! -What's going on? -She knows what's going on, the dirty old trollop! [audience gasp] She was the same at school. Never could be trusted, could ya? Always had her hands inside my pencil case. Get out of my pub! Maureen Hardcastle. She's a phoney ! She's false. Just like that rug on top of her head. [Audience] Ooh!

I've got friggin' witnesses. Robbie, tell them. I saw them both. Dad and Maureen. He was giving her one. -[audience gasps] -On a plank. -What? -Up a ladder. She was suspended, up there. -Billy! -Maureen. I haven't done anything. Then how do you explain this? -What is that? -Maureen's piss pot. [audience laughs] Billy? Have you been a bollocking with my wife, Bowmans? -Have I a buggery. -Have you? Of course he bleedin' hasn't. Woman of her girth and proportion, get a life! You cheeky arse bitch! Billy is mine. He bought me a ring. An engagement ring. -He what? -You keep your tired tits out of this, will you? I'm talking to her. Lady muck. At least you got a ring out of him, lovey. All I got was a broken hymen. Jesus tonight, he's give them all one! There's been a friggin' threesome! What have you been up to with these women? Orgies!

[people gasp] No, no I haven't. Oh, come on Jimmy. Hey, think about it. Have you seen her lately? She's an ugly, fat bitch. [everyone gasps] You liar. He did. What? Touch me. Billy Bowmans seduced me at Uncle Albert's. [people gasp] For a moment. -I didn't. -He did. And I've got the evidence. In here. [everyone gasps] And in nine months time, I shall prove it. [Tiffany gasps] Jimmy. [everyone shouts and cheers] Order! Come on girls, let's [mumbles]. [people shouting and screaming] Is that it? [everyone laughing] All that fuss about nothing. [everyone laughs] I've seen bigger on the end of a cocktail stick! [everyone laughs] [solemn music] Sandra! -What have you been up to? -Leave me alone! You're a contaminated bitch! You've made me a laughing stock. A pantaloon. Tomorrow morning, you'll see a doctor. If it's true, you get that thing of yours sucked out. Did you ever love me, Jimmy? Shut it! I need to know. -I married you, didn't I? -Why? Because you asked me to. I loved you, Jimmy. Did you? Yeah, I did. Aren't I the lucky one? I loved you ever so much. Once upon a time. [gentle piano music] [birds singing] Sandra! You dropped your shoe. And you dropped your knickers. Tell me it's not true. -I'm sorry. -How could you? I don't believe you. Billy always wears a Johnny. -He didn't this time. -Why? [Maureen] No idea. I suppose he thought I was past it. -Oh, and you're not. -No, I'm not. No, I went to Boots the chemist, bought myself a predictor. Turned blue. Why did you do it? I don't know, Sandra. [she sighs] I needed to feel it, I s'pose. Feel what? -Desire. -From Billy? No, love. From anyone. You slut! Jimmy and I haven't felt anything in years. Help me, Sandra. I'm all alone. [dog barking] [tyres screeching] Sandra, get in the car, we're going home. What home? I haven't got a home. Sandra, get in the car and do as you're told. Why should I? Because... It's you that I need. It's you that I want. It's you that I love. -Sandra. -What? Now get in the car and do as you're told! Oh, grow up! Love is a fairytale, Billy. Do you see what you've done? You satisfied? [rock music] [tyres screeching] You're a mongrel, Maureen! Oh, Maureen. You've ruined everything. I know. Nevermind. So have I. For 25 years, I lived with Billy. I tried to make his world beautiful. And what have I got to show for it? A stupid rose. And a thorn in my belly. It's not a thorn, Maureen. It's life. And very soon, just like you and me and the rest of the poor buggers in this world, it'll be crying out for it. Crying out for what? Some kind of tenderness. That's all I've ever wanted. Join the club. [Maureen chuckles] I already have. It's beyond sex, Maureen. What is? Love. Oh, aye, love. Oh Sandra, please forgive me. He's tripped you, Belafonte. Belafonte, push it through! [they shout] Give me that. Hey, I'll tell you what though. Bloody Friday. What? All them bloody women! [they laugh] Oh, I'll drink to that. Well, I shall tell her, from today it's me in charge. You tell her! You, you supply the merchandise. I'll supply the merchandise. And hey, hey, hey, and I supply the venue, right? You and me. You and me. And The Rude Boys. And The Rude Boys! 'Cause we've got it, lads. The Rude Boys! -It's our world! -Yes, the world is ours, Jimmy. Bloody hell, you must have been desperate though. What? What? Bloody fiddling about up there with Maureen. [he laughs] I don't want to talk about it, all right? I'll bet you bloody don't! The pair of them, they're rancid. [they laugh] Oh here they come, get 'em out, show us your tits! Come on boys, let's get moving. Where are you two going? We're going to Uncle Albert's. Robbie! So it's ta-ta to you, darlin'. Come on, Bosco. And we'll see the both of you in court. -What? -Divorce and child maintenance. What are you talking about? Me and Sandra, we're setting up home together. [they laugh] -Do you hear this? -Oh, aye. You two should do the same. You are suited. [Sandra] You're both a pair of twats. [Maureen laughs] Come on, boys. Let's shoot for the moon. * At first I was afraid * * I was petrified. * * Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side * * But then I spent so many nights * * Thinking how you did me wrong * * And I grew strong * * And I learned how to get along * * And now you're back * * From outer space * * I just walked in find you here * * With that sad look upon your face * * I should have changed that stupid lock * * I should have made you leave your key * * If I had known for just one second * * You'd be back to bother me * * Go on now go * * Walk out the door * * Just turn around now * * 'Cause you're not welcome anymore * * Weren't you the one that tried to hurt me with goodbye * * Did I crumble * * Did you think I'd lay down and die * * Oh no not I * * I will survive * * Oh, as long as I know how to love * * I know I'll stay alive * * I got all my life to live * * I've got all my love to give * * And I'll survive * * I will survive hey hey * * It took all the strength I had not to fall apart * * Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart * * And I spent oh so many nights * * Just feeling sorry for myself * * I used to cry * * But now I hold my head up high * * And you see me somebody new * * I'm not that chained-up little person * * Still in love with you * * And so you feel like dropping in * * And just expect me to be free * * And now I'm saving all my loving * * For someone who's loving me * * Go on now, go * * Walk out the door * * Just turn around now * * 'Cause you're not welcome anymore * * Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye * * Did I crumble * * Did you think I'd lay down and die * * Oh, no, not I * * I will survive * * Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive * * I've got all my life to live * * I've got all my love to give * * And I'll survive * * I will survive * * Hey hey * He's got my eyes.
