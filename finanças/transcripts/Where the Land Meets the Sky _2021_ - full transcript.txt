Hey, you awake? I just wanna take this moment in. The first morning waking up to my amazing husband. I am the happiest and luckiest girl on Earth. This is uh, Eric. Oh, uh, hi Ruth. What's, what's wrong? Oh, no. Oh, Ruth, I am so sorry. Um, yeah um, I will um, I'll make the arrangements. I'll um, I'll call you and I'll let you know. I'll be up there um, as soon as I can. All right um, tell Rachel I love her. Hmm-hmm. Okay. All right, bye-bye. Knock, knock. Hey, Earth to Eric. Hey, Tom. Sorry, I didn't hear you. What's up? What's up? Uh, meeting with our hopefully new client. Oh, yeah, right. Um, I'll be right there. Are you all right, man? Yeah, I just didn't get much sleep. Uh-huh. Well, you better wake up. Oh, and uh, Richie's running behind, so he'll be here later, but it just looks like it's you and me, my man. So you see in front of you how we've managed to not only attract buyers at close-to-asking price, we've done it in a very short time. I like what I see here. So how long have you been in business together? We'd like to know that we're not just letting anyone take this over. We're like a close-knit kind of real estate group. A business family, if you will. Yes, a family. And we like that you have that atmosphere here as well. So we like what we see. Make us like what we wanna hear. Oh, well, we're best friends, including our colleague Richie Casper, who unfortunately, can't be with us here today. Our families are very close. Isn't that right, Eric? Eric. I can't do this right now. I'm sorry, just not the right time. I apologize. I don't know what's going on here, but if you could just excuse me. Eric, what was that, man? We had them. What's goin' on? Well, we can kiss that client goodbye. Might I add the largest one we've ever had. Almost had. Eric, what's goin' on? Talk to me. It's about Lily. What about Lily? She's dead. Take that back. Yeah, of course. I'm just wantin' to concentrate here. You wanna win, you're ridiculous. If we're playin', we're playin' to win, all right, you know? There you go, smarty pants. Nug. Two, three, four, double-word score, that's eight. Okay. - Nug. - Nug, how many is that? That's one. All right. - Yeah, four. - Oh, okay. I don't know if that's a word. Sure, it is. I'm gonna take the dictionary out. Oh, stop. Did you change the board? There we go. Okay, look at my word. All right. Look at my word. I will not. But I think I'm winnin', so count my word. Count the numbers. You can't win yet. Go. No, I mean count it up and look at it. Three, four, seven, 11. Okay. But look at my word. Baby. Mm-hmm. - Baby. - Baby. - Baby? - Baby. Baby? Baby? - Yeah. - Are you pregnant? I am. Oh, we're gonna be parents? I'm so happy. I am, too. Hey, guys. Thanks for comin'. Eric, man, we are so sorry, brother. Um, I'm uh, I saw about this afternoon. Oh, don't even begin to bring that up. I don't even uh, I don't even know what to say. Um, please come on in. I'm so sorry to hear about Lily. Thank you. Oh, man. I mean can you imagine? I mean all she was doin' was drivin' to the store. I mean a simple trip to the store and this guy, and the truck pulls out in front of her. Head on? Yeah. And she died at the scene. How's Rachel and, and Lily's parents doin'? Oh, a mess, according to Lily's parents. I mean, they're sayin' Rachel's doing better than they are. I'm concerned about you. Thanks, but uh, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. I'm gonna head up there tomorrow morning sometime. Oh, let us know if you need anything, okay? I mean anything. Yeah. So um, I'll let you guys know when the memorial service is. Time, place. We'll be there. You know, after eight months I, I really thought we had a chance. Uh, I really uh, I really did think that. Mm, that smells good. Yeah, looks delicious. Guys, excuse me for a second. Katie, you didn't have to do this. I'm gonna be okay. Of course, you will, but for today you are going to have a home-cooked meal. She can be a bit pushy in the kitchen. Eric, you should know that. The way Lily and I would put you guys out of the kitchen all the time. Uh, I guess it's a woman thing. Eric, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean, I was just trying to- - It's okay, all right? I know what you're trying. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey. Hmm, perfect timin'. Mm, what do you think? Hmm? It's not too late to call for pizza, is it? You think you're clever, don't you? That's why you love me. Well, after a remark like that I'm starting to have my doubts. Honestly, it's the best meal I've ever had. Yeah, nice try, scooch. - Go. - Mommy. Yeah. What are we having for dinner? You and I are having pasta and vegetables. Your daddy is eatin' his foot. Ew, daddy, that's gross. - Yeah, it is. - What? You think my feet stink? Do you think my feet stink, do you, do you? Huh, huh? Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. - Hey, Eric, wake up. - Hey. Thanks for comin' early to get me, guys. Well, we were on our way, so we figured what the heck? So what happened? Well, as far as I can tell, the engine decided not to work anymore. That's your final prognosis? Well? Well uh, he's not wrong. Come on, get your stuff. What are you gonna do about your car? Nothin'. It's old anyway. Been lookin' to get rid of it. Maybe this is a sign. Put your coat on, okay? Eric. Eric. I love you. I do, but you have got to get help. Eric. You have to do this for you. Not just for me and Rachel. Go ahead. You didn't have to do this. Hey, we said we'd be there for you. It's the least we could do for you, buddy. Thank you. It's our pleasure. No, I mean thank you for everything you've done for me. Just do us a favor and get some sleep. We love you, buddy. Love you, guys. Okay. Okay, Lily, you're doing great. You're doing amazing. Come on, baby, come on. You can do it, Lily. Just stay with me. You can do it. No, I can't take it, I can't- - Oh, come on, baby, come on. - I see the head. - Yes, you can! - No, I- - Yes, you can! One more push! Come on! - One more push! - Come on! Come on, Lily! Oh! Oh! She's a beautiful baby girl! - You did it. - It's a baby girl. Oh, you did it, baby. - You did it. - Oh my God. Oh, look at her. Hey. Rise and shine. Here. You slept in your clothes? So it appears so. Uh, thank you for the coffee. Um, can y'all just give me a second? I'll be right out. Yeah, sure. All right, hurry up, buddy. Um, we wanna go to breakfast before. All right. Just give me a second, all right? All right. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Okay, we'll see in church. - Any sugar? - No, thank you. So I saw you were brought here. You didn't bring your car? Uh, I broke down on the way here. Oh gosh, I'm sorry. Did you get a towed? No, I'm just gonna let it go. Eric. Ruth, um, how you holdin' up? Okay, I guess. I mean as well as can be expected. You know, Rachel's in her room. Ruth, it's been almost nine months. I don't even know what to say to her. Start with hello and then go from there. "And when the captain of the broken boat looked upon the ocean and saw a bird land on his deck, he knew then that hope was not lost." Because a bird needs way. That's exactly right. So smart. You know, the meanin' of the story is that no matter what there's always hope. You know who brought that bird? God. God, yes. Hey, do me a favor, okay? If you are ever scared or frustrated, I want you to ask God to show you a bird and you will know that everything is gonna be okay. Okay? Okay. Promise? Okay. Love you, mommy. Mm, I love you more, munchkin. You ready to go to bed? Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Rachel, it's daddy. So happy to see you. I missed you. Did you miss me? Um, sugar bear, I am so sorry for not bein' here and for everything that's goin' on. Do you wanna talk about mommy? You can if you want to. I'm sorry to interrupt. We have to get goin'. You ready? Okay, let's go. Ruth, let's go, we're gonna be late. When'd you get here? A little while ago. I was right- - Ruth, come on, we're gonna be late. I'm coming. I just can't find my glasses. Ruth, honey, they're right over there. I'm so sorry. I just can't think. Uh, hey, hey, hey. I know, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay, grandma. Mommy is watching over you, too, just like me. How did you get to be so smart? Okay, ready to say goodbye? We all know the verse where God gives and takes away. Job, chapter one, verse 21 says, "Naked I came from my mother's womb and naked shall I return there. The Lord gave and the Lord's taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Though, it's hard to imagine that God's taken Lily away from us so young, we must remember that God is in control and He has a plan. Whatever that plan may be we may never know or maybe it's right there in front of our faces. We just have to sit, be still, and listen. Lily was a God-fearin' person and in knowing that we mourn that we won't see her again on this Earth, but if we are God-fearing people as Lily was, we know we will see her again. Take comfort in that. Hey, Eric. You all right, man? I don't think so. Yeah, it's gonna take some time. I know it's tough, we all loved her. If I hadn't been the way I was, blamin' myself for that kid's death, I never would have driven her away and she would have never been on that road. Hey, man, you can't do that to yourself. You can't blame yourself for this. I just keep thinking. I know, I know, but listen, you can't blame yourself. You had no control over what happened. Just like you had no control over what happened in school last year. Look, I get it. I just keep thinking. I feel uh- - Alone? Confused? I understand that, but listen, you got a great daughter in there who loves you and lookin' to be with her daddy again. Don't blow this. What do you mean? Yeah, I saw all the bottles in your room. I know you drinkin' again. That just happened the day you guys came here. I just found out that Lily died. I had nowhere else to turn to, right? I'm gonna get better I promise. I will. Hey, I'm not the one you need to be makin' that promise to. Oh! Gosh! - What are you so- - I'm sorry. You're good. What are you so giddy about? I got some amazing news today, but I wanted to wait till tonight to tell you. You're not pregnant again, are you? No, but it's kinda funny how you went there first. You're naughty. I know. So? Okay, so Scott Peters called me today. Hmm. And they wanna release my first book. Oh! I know! Oh my God! I'm so excited. I can't, like I can't, right? I don't blame you. That is so awesome. I'm so excited. I know. Okay, and get this. If everything goes okay, and everything is gonna go okay. Yes, it will. They wanna sign me on for two more. Two more! I can't, I'm so, oh my God, this could change everything. You are amazing. Amazing. I am amazing. Oh gosh, I love you. I love you, too. Knock, knock. - Rachel. - Hi. Hey Hey, I, I just wanted to let you know how proud of you I was today. You're very grown up. What are you two doin'? I was just tellin' Rachel how proud of her I am. It's good. Rachel, honey, just keep playin' with your doll. Eric. - Hmm? - Can I have a word? Right back. I just don't know what to do now. What do you mean? What are you saying? I know that a father belongs with her daughter. I just don't think that I can risk having you take her. She's my daughter. - I have every right to be- - Right? Right? You gave up that right when you turned from your family and ran to your bottle. Why don't you just tell me how you really feel about me? Okay, I'll say it as plainly as I can. Because of you our beautiful daughter is dead! Enough! I will not have this bickering the very day that I buried my only daughter. Now, you hear me! Oh, Rachel, sweetheart, everything is okay. If you think you're gonna be alone with my granddaughter you get another thing comin'! She's my daughter! - Yeah. - Stop it, both of you! Act your age! I can't take this. Eric, maybe just go back to the hotel and, and let things calm down. I don't wanna go back to the motel. I wanna be the one that spreads her ashes and I want Rachel with me when I do it. Let me prove that I can be responsible, right? Like the father that I once was. I don't know, Eric. Please, give me a chance. Help me. Help me, give me a chance to do the right thing. At least, give me a chance to do the right thing about Rachel. Eric, let us think about it, okay? And Ted didn't mean it like that. Ruth, thank you, but yes, he did. Just give him time. I mean I think that's what we all need right now, right? It's time and prayer. Yes, may I help you? Hi, Ruth, it's pastor Tom Tavares. Oh. Sorry to bother you. I just heard about your dilemma and I wanted to see how I could help. Thank you. All right, any help or guidance will be appreciated. I'd like you to meet Sharon Williams. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. I heard you needed some help and I want to volunteer. - How exactly? - May we come inside? Oh, yes, yes, come inside, come inside. Thank you. Yes. What? All right, all right. Uh, I'll be right there. Um, okay. Yes, um, I need a cab, please. Um, I need to go to the nearest car rental place. Eric, how you doin'? - Confused. - Okay, come on in. Come on this way. Eric, this is Miss Sharon Williams. - Pleased to meet you. - Hi. Come on, sit down. So what's goin' on here? You said you have a solution for me. Yes, Eric, uh, Sharon here is the solution. Come again. Well, Eric, well, Pastor Tavares, which is Ted and Ruth's minister, called just a little bit after you left yesterday. You know, just to see how we're doin' and you know, if we needed anything. Yeah, Ruth mentioned, mentioned you to him and, and asked for some guidance. You told a total stranger about this. Unbelievable! He's not a stranger. Eric, I want nothing more than for you and Rachel to be together, but you have to understand where we're coming from. I do but- - Uh, Eric, let 'em speak. This is the only way we're gonna agree to this. Thanks, Ted. Look, Eric, uh, um, bottom line is they're gonna let you take Rachel with you when you spread your wife's ashes, but well, however, I'm coming with you. No offense, but why? I don't even know you. I know. I know you don't know me. But when Pastor Tavares was looking for someone to, to go on a mission of trust, I, I was the first one to, to volunteer. Now, well, I haven't been in church that long, but it was a huge leap of faith for everyone to agree. And I feel like this was somethin' that was placed in my heart to do. This is your only chance. I just lost a daughter and I will not risk my only granddaughter to a drunk. Ted, enough. Run on again. Uh, yeah, that's what you do best. Fine, I need to go lay down. Eric, please sit down. Please. Eric, I know it's been hard on all of you, but I agreed to do this and I know you don't know me, but uh, you say you wanna get your daughter back. Eric, please give this a chance. Whose car is this? It's a rental. What does that mean? It means your dad is borrowing this car at a very high price. Come on, let's get in. She sure is a precious little thing. Hmm, thank you. So Eric, may I ask where you from? Why? Well, at least another seven hours on this trip. I thought we could at least discuss something. Originally, I was born in Nebraska, but raised in Georgia. Oh, I was born and raised in Seville. I'm very proud of that city. You like it there? Oh, yes, indeed. I have everything I need there. I have my friends, my family, and even my home church. Ladies down there are somethin' else. Can I ask you somethin'? Yeah, I'm an open book. Why'd agree to, why agree to come along on this trip? I mean I know you said your minister asked you and that God told you to, but other than that why? You know, sometimes God works in mysterious ways. Now, I'm sure there's a very perfect and good answer for your question, but for right now, I'll just say uh, I felt like that's the right thing to do. Hey, you're okay back there? I'm thirsty and I have to use the bathroom. See? There you go. I told you. Perfect timing. See? God works in the most mysterious ways. I don't think it was God. Uh, um, this wouldn't be bad to stretch our legs, maybe get somethin' cold to drink. Rachel, do you know why I came with you on the trip? Yes, Miss Sharon, you wanna help. Yeah, somethin' like that. I'd bet you're happy for daddy, though, right? Miss Sharon, can I get this soda? Are you supposed to have that? Okay. I don't think so. Water, juice or milk. - No, I want soda. - Young lady. - Mommy, would let me- - Well, mommy isn't here! I didn't mean, thank you, sugar bear. Rachel, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. Just give her some time, okay? Well, I think she finally met her match. Hmm. One would think that a woman's husband who is so good at most things would be able to figure out this one little thing. What are you talking about? Be right back. Hey, Lil, I really think we need to call a um- Okay, how did you do that? It wasn't fully in park. And you could tell just from the engine? You did that before. Don't you remember? No. - And besides I know, so- - Yes. Okay, carry on, my handsome little grease monkey. You're so funny. I know. Hey, just be happy we don't live on the hill. - Just sayin'. - Thank you. Wooh! Great, we got a flat tire. Eric, are you okay? Yeah, just thinkin'. Um, let's go find a service station. What you thinkin' about? Lookin' at those run-down buildings over there? Yeah. Most people would see those as an eyesore, but not Lily. No. She would either call it a link to our past that stored happiness within the walls or she would say, "It's not an eyesore. It's an opportunity just waiting to be discovered." She really had a way with words. Yes, she did. I think your father and her would have got along great. You know what? I think you, I think you're right about that. The way I heard how she would put others before herself. No doubt about it. I would have loved to have met her. Chu-chu. You know, I think she would have as well. It's Eric. Oh, all right, yeah. No, we're just grabbin' a cup of coffee. All right. About what time? Okay, great. All right, see you then. All right, thank you. Car's done. All right, folks, we're all set here. Just need to contact the rental company about your bill and then we'll, we'll get you on your way. All right, thank you. No problem. Y'all be safe now. Appreciate it. All right, let's load up. Quarterback fakes throw left, hands off right- - Daddy, can you play a game with me? I'm watchin' the game, baby. And tries to cut through the middle. But I want you to play a game with me. Rachel, I'm watching the game. Go ask your mother. Hey, baby, what's wrong? Daddy, yelled at me. Yeah, I heard. Hey, how about I play a game with you? Then cookies after? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. Yeah, it's all good. Come on. He caught him napping and now it's nothing but open field ahead! 35, 40! What a block! 45, still going! Whoa. Sorry about that. You need me to take over? Yeah, I think so and maybe get somethin' to eat. Yeah, 'cause I don't feel like playin' target practice with trucks today. You okay back there, sugar bear? Fine. - I'm sorry. - Drive better next time. Please stop kickin' daddy's seat. Rachel, I said stop! Rachel, your daddy says "stop". What's gotten into you? Because daddy almost did what mommy did and he needs to stop it. Hey. Eric, you okay? Rachel! Hey, what do you think you're doing, young lady? Do you know how dangerous it is out here? - A car could- - You scared me, daddy! Rachel, I know you were scared and I'm sorry, but we're gonna be okay. I promise I'll drive better next time. You want Miss Sharon to drive until you're not scared anymore? Okay, come on, let's get some food. Feel better? Ooh, Lord, this is just too tasty not to finish. Not bad for a side-of-the-road place, huh? Well, some of the best places I ever ate are places like this. You could taste the love in the food. You're a cook? I hadn't killed anybody yet. I learned how to cook from my grandmother and that's a good thing, too, 'cause my mother, she was a horrible cook. Okay, uh, eat some more of your hot dog and then you can color some more. Rachel. Eric, what happened back there? You mean with the little runaway here? I mean back down the road, the truck. Been daydreaming lately. Of Lily? Yeah. I just got lost in my thoughts- - You don't need to say anything right now. I'll let you in on a little secret, though. Eventually, you're gonna have to. So we could see the world the way we saw it. Hey, sweetie, you dropped this. I thought you might want it. Thank you, miss. Well, you are quite welcome. We don't wanna leave that little guy behind. So where's your mommy and daddy? Miss Sharon is in the office. My daddy is in the car. Probably fell asleep again. Okay, sweetie, let's go wake up your dad. I better get going. Thank you, miss. - Yeah, you're welcome. - Come on, sweetie. Cute little girl. Yeah, she dropped her toy. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Did you get our rooms? Yeah. Let's go get some sleep. Okay, awesome. Rachel, don't you think it's gonna be a little difficult sleeping with all those dolls? No, they help me sleep. Oh, really? How do they help you sleep? I don't know, just do. Hey, um, Rachel I um, I know I haven't been a very good father and um, I wanna do better, but I'm hopin' you give me that chance. Daddy, can you read me a story. Oh, that's right. Mommy used to read you a story every night. Um, but uh, I don't have a book. That's okay, daddy. Hey. Hey, um, how about a um, a song? What do you wanna hear? Well, mommy always sing a song, but I can't remember what was, though. Oh, let me see. Let me see if I can remember that. Uh, uh, I think it goes something like this. ♪ I travel far and away ♪ ♪ Looking for another day ♪ ♪ Lost on my journey to find my way ♪ ♪ When you came along ♪ ♪ You believed in me in spite of my lies ♪ ♪ You cleared the clouds that covered my eyes ♪ ♪ And you showed me the place ♪ ♪ Where the land meets the sky ♪ How was that? I know I'm not, mommy, but- - It was good, daddy. Thank you. I love you, sugar bear. I love you, too, daddy. Get some sleep. - You never learn, do you? - Lily. Look at you. You finally have the attention of your daughter and you just sit here in your own self-pity. It's just so hard. I mean if it wasn't for me you would still be alive. Oh, Eric, this isn't about me. This is about you and Rachel. And you need to stop using me as an excuse for your drinking. I can't help it. I just want this pain to go away. I want all of it to go away. Tell me how to do it. I can't do that for you this time. It's something that you need to figure out on your own. I love you. You know that. I always have and I always will, but, Eric, you have to let me go. It's not your fault that I'm gone. It was my time. We don't have any control over that. It's just, it's all part of the plan. Plan? What kind of plan takes somebody like you? Somebody that's kind and sweet, gentle. I don't see any evidence of a perfect plan. I just see my wife's ashes and my daughter that's missin' her. And that, my love, well, that is how you will always see me. Tell me how to see the world through your eyes. What am I missing? Hmm. For you to have your answer all you have to do is one thing. What? Hey, there. Can't sleep, huh? No, I guess not. Heading out early? We're going camping and hiking a little north of here. North Florida State Park. Hey, I think we met your daughter earlier. She's a total sweetheart. Thank you. Are you guys vacationing? Well, somethin' like that. Well, not to sound too forward, but if you're heading back north again soon, you should take your daughter there. Oh yeah, it's a great place uh, for kids and adults. I'm Ginger and this is Tanya, by the way. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Eric. Eric. Great place to take your mind off things. And you know God's country will do that for you. Wow, I think she would love this. Thanks. Great. Well, if you want a couple of tour guides- - You're lookin' at 'em. Yeah, we go all the time. You know, get rid of crazy boyfriends, family drama. Just total crazy life in general. Well, Eric, perhaps, we'll see you guys up there. You two usually meet people in hostels and do this? That's embarrassing. No, just something told us that maybe just you guys might need this. Yeah, maybe a little getaway, if you will. Well, we should probably head out and hopefully, we will see you again. Our campsite is lot number 25 and I'm going to give you my number, just in case. Thank you. Have a goodnight. Have a great rest of your night. - Good night, guys. - Bye. Tough night? Yeah, I don't uh, I don't sleep well in a strange bed. Lack of sleep, huh? Yeah, that's all. And uh, you able to drive? I got this, I'm fine. Okay. So these girls gave you this and their phone number? The two girls? Would you stop it? You know, it's not what you think. They saw Rachel and they thought it would be fun for us to go. I got nothin' better to do. Well, we have to stop somewhere, so why not? Hmm. So it says, "A place to get away from everyday life." This even looks good to me and I don't care. All them bugs and bears. No. It's not that bad. You ever been to Florida? They got cockroaches this big that will carry you off in your sleep. Come on, let's go. It's a beautiful day. She loved it here. Park, beach. So tell me about it, tell me about her. Hey, Rachel, why don't you go on and play? Okay. Lillian was an amazing mom and wife. I mean she was just an amazing person altogether. I mean she was perfect. Tell me more about her. Lily had a knack that anyone she met just fell in love with her. I mean oh, and what an amazing mother. I mean her and Rachel had this special bond between them even before we had split up. She sounds extraordinary. She had a gift of makin' people feel wanted. I mean she even dealt with my issues before it became too much. So what happened to that? Oh, and uh, she loved to write poetry and in her book she wrote, she has somethin' in there for Rachel. Eric, you have got to come face-to-face with your past. It's affecting your present and it will just destroy your, your future. I don't know what to do. I mean I, I loved her so much and I, I just wanna cry out to God and say, "Why did you take her?" I mean I just want all this pain inside me to go away. Then just do it. I can't. Not in front of Rachel. Eric, that little girl is hurting. She is bein' strong for you. Both of you need to let go. And she needs this. Tell her it's okay to cry as I tell you it's okay to forgive yourself. Your mommy really loved it here. Did you know we took you here when you were just a baby? Really? Hmm. Rachel, before we do this uh, I want you to always remember that your mommy still loves you. And she's watching down from heaven. Have you cried for mommy yet? 'Cause you're wantin' to be strong? You know, I think we've both been holdin' back our tears, but I wanna let you know that it's okay to cry. Your mommy wrote this and I wanted you to hear it, because it was the last thing she wrote. And, she wrote it to you. She said, "How I wish for wonders in life for my little girl. How I wish for you to fly as high as the birds in the sky and roam as far as the animals on land. Your dreams are anything you want them to be, because you are everything you can be. For your dreams are as far as the point where the land meets the sky. Why there, my sweet? I will tell you, because it's always ongoing. For may your dreams and happiness always be ongoing and never end. I wish this for you, my little girl." Mommy wrote that just for you. You ready? Lily. I loved you so much and uh, I am so sorry for everything I've done. You're an amazing mother and wife, and uh, I know I've let you down. I wanna let you know that I'll never let you or Rachel down again. Goodbye, my love. You wanna say anything? I love you, mommy. I miss you. Good evenin'. Here for this evenin'? Yes, sir. Okay, so just so you know the only trails that are open are those on this year map. Okay, and how much? 20. Well, there you go. Thank you, sir. The restaurant is still open, by the way and we have a 24-hour shop and snack bar. Have fun. All right, thank you very much. - All right. - All right. Thanks. Thanks. Eric! Hey, Ginger. So glad you guys could make it. - Good to see you. - You too. Ginger, this is my daughter Rachel. Nice to see you, Rachel. I'm Ginger. - Hello. - Hi. And this is our friend Sharon. We're huggers. Okay. Pleasure to meet you, Sharon. Likewise. Okay, ready for some yummy food? Yeah. Hey uh, why don't you guys go with Miss Ginger. I'm gonna get some stuff out of the trunk. Need help with that? No, I'm good, thank you. Okay. Come on, let's go. This way. So what do you girls do? Oh, well, I manage a clothing store. And I work in a call center. We're both from Miami. We just like to come here to get away from it all. So you guys on a little vacation? We said goodbye to my mommy. Said goodbye? She passed away. We were down here spreading her ashes. I am so sorry. I apologize for being so forward. No, it's fine, really. And you're right. This is a great getaway, it's beautiful out here. Look up at all the birds and pretty clouds in the sky. God's masterpiece at work. Where are you goin'? Just gonna go stretch my legs. I'll be back. Okay. Okay. Miss Sharon, can I go play over there? Stay, stay close. I will. You okay? Yeah, I'm just gettin' some air. You know we are outside, right? Uh, Lily used to hate camping, but she always did it for Rachel. That little kid's going to be the best Girl Scout ever. She is precious. How is she holding up? Better than I am. She's a strong little lady. Like her mom. I'm really sorry about your wife. We just never know why things happen the way they do, but just trust that in the end we will understand. I believe that God has a place and a reason for all of us. Well, you know what? I would really like to know the reason why somebody so young and amazing like Lily was taken. I would really like to know that. You're angry at God? Oh yeah, I'm angry at God, but I think I'm more angry at myself, because I should have done things differently. Can I leave you with a piece of advice from a friend? Forgive yourself. I know you hear people say, "It's not your fault" and that's all well and good, but it does little to help the pain inside. You need to come to peace with this or it will tear you apart. Trust me. Oh my gosh. You see, we all have our troubles in this life and we all fall short. I became a cutter when my husband died two years ago. So yeah, I feel your pain. But like with all things, the pain will subside. It's just a matter of how we go about it. That is in your hand, because that is what God has given us. Freedom of choice. You have been given a second chance to do something amazing in that little girl's life. Trust me. So I, so I took him out to the water, and he was at the, at the water's edge. And he was like playin' with it, you know? He was like, he was hittin' the water and was, what's wrong? May I ask why you and your wife split up? You seem to be an amazing father to Rachel. Well, I haven't always been the best husband, hence that's the reason why we were separated. Hey, it's okay if you don't wanna say. Believe me I know what it is like. A friend of mine was a director at a local community theater. He asked me to build a set for him. I've always been good with my hands, even with this coat-and-tie job that I have now. Make it grandiose, he said. So I did. Everything was goin' along great. One day, I came in and I was sick as a dog. A massive headache and all that I wanted to do was get out of there as quick as possible. You know, maybe I cut some corners. Go on, what happened? I am so sorry, Eric. She was just a kid. She was actually covering for a friend. She didn't even need to be there. - I'm sure there is um, uh- - What, a reason? There is no reason, there is no plan. It's just life. And you know what? Sometimes life really sucks! And if this is of God, I really think he owes a big explanation. Let me guess. You started drinking. Drugs. Am I getting warmer? Drinking. And I had a problem with it in the past, but when Lily came into my life, I suddenly quit. It was like magic or somethin'. I really thought God was a good guy and was thankin' him for Lily. But not now? Oh, of course, I'm still thankin' him. Look, what everything that's happened to me. For what? Tell me. All I want is answers. That you will have to find out on that narrow road alone. Eric, Eric, come quick. What? What happened? Rachel, she, she, she was playin', but wandered deep into the woods. - Where is she? - I don't know. Tanya heard her scream, we ran into the woods. Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Is she, Rachel! Rachel! Where is she? God, please, let this baby be okay. Rachel, it's daddy! Where are you? Don't you take her from me! Not now! Rachel! I found her! Over here! Come on. - Rachel? - She won't wake up. Rachel, oh my gosh! Oh, come on, baby, stay with me, all right? Come on. Somebody call 911. I just, I just called 911, they're on their way. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go. She's gotta be okay. So guess God wants to take another one from me? Is it because of my actions? Why not just do somethin' to me? Tell me that? Have you prayed about this? Oh please, Sharon! I'm done with that nonsense! Why should I? Okay, God, I'm here. I'm listenin'. Show me a sign. Show me somethin'. Why are you doin' this to me? First, you took that kid who did nothing wrong. And then you took Lily. And now you're gonna take my little girl. I know I've made mistakes. Forgive me. I'm so sorry for everything I've done. Please, save my little girl. She's all I got left. Don't take her from me. Please forgive me. Please be real. I beg you please be real. Are you okay? Yeah. Well, the doctor needs to see you. Why? What happened? Uh, just, she's awake. She's awake. She, can I see her? Eric Rogers? Hi, Dr. Henry Lopez, I'm Rachel's doctor. Um, she's awake? Yes, she is. The fall wasn't too bad. She has a small cut and a bruise. Other than that she's fine. Oh, thank God. Actually, her fall is a blessing in disguise. Why? You see we just got through with her MRI and it turns out that your daughter has very early stages of a, a brain aneurysm. - Oh, my God. - No, no listen. This type is very rare in children. It's not easily detected unless a doctor is looking for something else. I, I mean I don't understand. I mean you said- - Listen, listen, we caught it early. It's very good news. And we can treat it, but we have to act right away before it ruptures, possibly causing severe brain damage or death. I know this comes as a great shock, but everything's gonna be okay. So you, you're sayin' that if, if she had not fallen then you probably couldn't have detected it for some time? Possibly. Look, we're reeling her out to get started soon, but I'll go ahead and give you some time with her alone. All right. - Thank you, doctor. - My pleasure. Thank you. She's gonna be okay. But did you hear what he said? The fall that she had should not have knocked her out. So I guess you could say that's a miracle. What do you mean? God works in mysterious ways remember? I'll be back. Send her my love. Daddy, I'm so glad to see you. I'm doubly glad to see you, sugar bear. I got a bump on my head. It hurts. I know, but the doctor said it's gonna be okay. I know, daddy. Mommy told me. What do you mean mommy told you? Yeah, when I was asleep. She was so beautiful. She had light all around her and she told me that I would be okay. - She did? - Yeah. And that she's happy and waiting to see us again in heaven. - Hmm. - And she also said that something like, oh, that she loves you and you are forgiven. I'm so happy to hear that. Um, listen, sugar bear, the, the doctors need to make you sleepy so they can check things out and make sure you're okay. I know. It'll be okay, daddy. I'll be okay. You are the bravest little girl I know. You know something? What? You give me strength. I love you, sugar bear. I love you too, daddy. Sir, it's time to go. See you soon, sugar bear. Love you, daddy. I love you. Here you go, sweetie. A little bird. I thought you might like it. Thank you. You're welcome. Where is my granddaughter at? Ted. Ted, she's gonna be okay. Where is, where's Ruth? She's out front, she dropped me off, and is lookin' for a parking space. What happened? Oh, you must be the three friends. Well, I'm, I'm glad you're all here. She hit her head playing ball, but she's fine. - Oh, thank God. - Yes, she's fine. Where's Eric? Hey, guys. Um, the, the doctors found an aneurysm. They're prepping her for surgery right now. Are you serious? She's gonna be okay. If she hadn't fallen, we would have never known. Eric, you look calm and at peace. For once in a long time, I am at peace. What changed? I finally understand. Understand what? What Lily has been wanting me to see. I see it so clearly now. With some help from my friend. Hey, guys, let's give them a moment. I'm happy she's gonna be okay, man. Good to have you back. Eric. Sir. I'm glad to have you back, too. I am thoroughly convinced that he's gonna be an amazing father. Just a little guidance. Hey, wait up. Where are you two ladies headed off to? We gotta get going. And we don't wanna intrude. Oh, nonsense. Please stay. We really need to go, but very happy to hear about Rachel. Eric, I believe that you and Rachel are gonna be just fine. You are gonna be just fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just happy we were there to help you guys. Yeah. It was meant to be. I believe so. Always have faith that God knows what He is doing. No matter how far down we get, He will always be there to pick us up. All you have to do is ask. Yeah. I think you're gonna be just fine. Bye, Eric. Oh, thank you. Tell Sharon and Rachel goodbye for us. I will. And you have our numbers, so- - Yep. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Thank you again. Okay. Anytime. Well? She's doin' just fine. Oh. And the surgery was a success. Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. That's great. - Thank you, Jesus. - I'm gonna go see her. Oh, what a great news. Oh, thank you, guys. Thank you. I'm so happy. - Oh, oh. - Yeah, how about that? Oh yeah. Oh, man. I wanna thank you so much. You didn't have to come on this trip with two people you didn't know, but I'm so happy you did. I couldn't have made this without you. Thank you, my friend. Come on. Well, looks like my work here is done. Where are you goin'? I'm going back home. I, I did what was asked of me. Uh, Eric, you're gonna be just fine. Will I see you again? Oh, most definitely, yes. Sharon, do you need a ride? Oh, no, no, no. I, I have a way home. Well, let's go see her. Hey, guys, she's sleeping. Let's let her sleep. Cafeteria anyone? - Yeah. - Sounds good. I think Ruth and Ted went to go see her, so I'll let them know and catch up with you. Um, guys, go ahead, I'll catch up. I just need a minute. All right. Thank you, God. Thank you for saving my little girl.
