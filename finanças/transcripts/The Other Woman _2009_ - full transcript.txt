...On the way out, but we'll still be dealing with some scattered snow flurries and sleet. Expect it to be over by early afternoon with highs today in the mid-30s. Freezing temperatures will be back this evening with lows in the mid-20s in Manhattan and high teens in the outlying suburbs. So wrap up. Right now we have a weather-related delay in the Lincoln Tunnel where a semi apparently hit some ice... It's a good school, isn't it? You never know. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. I'm Jamie Brennan. Hi. My daughter's in the fourth grade. We just moved here from L.A. Hi, I'm Emilia. - Hi. - I'm with William Woolf. He's in third. He's my stepson. Ugh, they don't mind staring, do they? Yeah, well, you're new, and you're talking to the only second wife here. I terrify them, like there's such a thing as a home-wrecker. There is in California. Now you're nervous. Oh, no, of course not. Miss Emilia? Sonia, isn't this your day off? - Yes. - It's Wednesday, right? Yes, yes. Dr. Soule asked me to give to you this for the ears of William. I go to her office to pick up. She made you work on your day off? So three times a day, he takes this with food. And keep cold, but not in fridge. Oh, and Dr. Soule also says when Mr. Woolf drop off William this time, his clothes are clean and fold, not just shoving in backpack. They were not shoved. They were folded, I mean, casually. And they were clean. Worn once, washed once: clean. This is not me. This is Dr. Soule. And do not yell at me. It is very embarrassing to be yelling at me in public. I'm not yelling at you, Sonia. I'm sorry. Okay, I will remember. Cold, not fridge. Clean, not shoved. Sonia! Ooh, William. I just say hello and good-bye. I bring medicine from your mommy. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. Hello, Emilia. Hey, William. You ready? Okay, William, I go to my day off now. Bye. Bye. See you tomorrow. Good-bye, Miss Emilia. Sorry, pal. It's just me today, Wednesday. - So it is. - So it is. My gloves weren't in my cubby. - Here, take mine. - They're too big. William, come on. Let's go. Nice talking to you. Have a nice life. Oh, great. It's gonna rain. Why didn't you call the car service? Everyone calls the car service when it rains. Everyone? You know, not everyone can afford a car service. My dad can. Well, look, what are all those mothers doing? Just waving at traffic? No. So clearly not everyone who can afford it thinks it's necessary to arrange for a car service, okay? Sonia always calls the car service when it rains. She checks the weather the night before. I don't want to hear an eight-year-old say "car service" again, okay? - Car service. - There's one. I wonder what temperature poop freezes at. Yeah, me too. Constantly. Come on. You know that since poop comes out hot, it freezes quicker than a popsicle? - Mind-blowing. Get in. - It's because of evaporation. Hot water evaporates quicker. - So poop, which has hot water... - William... - Oh, oh! Oh, dear. - God damn it, William. Oh, get in. - Ow! That hurt! - Tell your mother. West 7th and 81st, please. God, William, keep your foot away from the heater. Today's a good day for a video. I can't. I already watched one Sunday night. I have to wait till Saturday to start a new week. So I'll just play with my Mega Science Lab. Take off your wet coat before we go in the kitchen. I'll probably gather the bacteria from the sink and look at it with my microscope. That sounds fun. It says on the box it's for ages ten and up. You mean you're not supposed to be a nerd for two whole years? - It's not nerdy to be smart. - Wait, this is the age of the nerd. That was a compliment. What's for snack? Check your shelf. There's some stuff there. Yay, Tofutti Cuties. - What kid doesn't love tofu? - Oh, wait. I don't like the strawberry ones. I'll have a soy pudding. Chocolate. Mmm, fat-free, sugar-free, fruit juice-sweetened. Enjoy that. Hey, can I have a bowl for this? People touch this at the store. Yeah, just think of all the little boys that die eating their pudding directly from the container. The body count is crazy. - Emilia, do you know what eBay is? - Yes, I do. My friend Bailey's dad sells things on eBay. He takes all their old stuff they don't need anymore, - like Bailey's old bike, and sells it. - That's nice. Maybe you should go on eBay. I figure if I need an old bike, Bailey's dad will sell it to me. Not to buy. To sell. To make money. Don't you have any old stuff? I have strawberry Tofutti Cuties, like new, in original box. I mean the baby's stuff. We should sell the baby's stuff on eBay. We can sell the crib. The crib cost exactly $1,311. Dad told me. So I bet we can get $2,000 for the crib. Maybe even $10,000. No, we wouldn't. That's how eBay works. Take all the old stuff you don't need anymore, and people give you money for it. We wouldn't get $10,000 for the crib on eBay, okay, William? We can sell the stroller too. I bet we can get $5,000 for the stroller. That's not how it works. You're not going to get all that money for something used when you could get it new for a lot less. That doesn't even make sense. It's not used, though. We never used it. Bailey's dad says... William, I really don't want to talk about selling the baby's things, okay? - But that's what it's for. - William, shut up! Just shut up about eBay, okay? Leave me alone, please. Just go watch TV or something. Leave me. I'm home. In here. Thai. Great. Can I give you a hand? I got it under control. Yeah? Hello. So what'd you guys do today? Oh, built a cold fusion reactor out of swizzle sticks and rubber bands. We had a little thing, actually. Dad, Dad! Hey. - I missed you so much. - I missed you too, Will. Who wants to help set the table? Emilia told me to shut up today. And she yelled at me. Really? What's going on? William suggested that we sell the baby's things on eBay. The crib and the stroller. Okay. Well, we don't have to sell those things. Anything that we're not using is okay. Like, we can sell my old MEGA Bloks, 'cause I don't use those anymore. Yeah, but you didn't say your old MEGA Bloks. - You said the baby's things. - Just a minute, Em. Will, did you really want to sell the baby's things? - What? I just told you. - A minute, Em, please. Will? Well, I wanted to do eBay, and I was trying to think of things we aren't using. So I figured, the baby's dead. She's not gonna be using her stuff anymore. I didn't mean to make Emilia so mad. See, Emilia is so sad about the baby that it's hard for her to think about selling the baby's things. And you're right. We don't need them anymore, but she's right too. We're not gonna sell the baby's things. Okay. I'm sorry, Dad. I know you didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. I know it. And Emilia knows it. And she's sorry too. Right, Emilia? I know I have to clear her room out. I just can't pack up all her stuff yet. It's okay. I'm not building a shrine or anything. I know. It's okay. I'm sorry I said "shut up." I'm gonna read, okay? Okay. - Good night. - Good night. I'm so happy to be here. Oh, we're delighted to have you, Miss Greenleaf. This is a great opportunity for you to start your career. I'm so excited. I've been hearing about Friedman Taft from my father since as long as I can remember. Is your father a lawyer? A judge in Westchester. President of the New York Bar Association, formerly. Oh, right, yes. That's in here. Oh, oh! Oh. - Oh, are you okay? - Marilyn. My ankle! Jack, yes. Just need a minute. Does it hurt when I squeeze? Ouch! Yes. Oh, could you just grab that door? - Yeah. - Thanks. Okay, slowly, Marilyn. Slowly, slowly, slowly. I feel so stupid, Jack. Okay. There you go. All right. All right. I'm the new associate, by the way, Emilia Greenleaf. Jack Woolf. Nice to meet you. Same. Miss Greenleaf, you're in room 1818. Thank you. I'll get some ice, okay? Ice, yes, please. Of course he's married. He's a senior partner. They're always married. What'd you expect? I just-I thought I'd get over this months ago. But I'm still, like, weak when I'm around him, and he doesn't even know I'm alive. "He doesn't know I'm alive"? What, are you in the clich√© Olympics? Ha-ha. Don't you street lawyers have paralegals? No, friends are cheaper. I'm sorry I'm late, you guys. - Hi. - I couldn't find a cab. God, I wish someone here in New York would invent something kind of like a train, you know, that would go underground and take you places. No, that's crazy talk. Harris doesn't want me taking the subway anymore. Oh, seriously? Press packets? You really think this slumlord cares about bad press? If she bails, I get her beer. Oh, no. I'm not drinking. I can't. Or smoke. Or eat tuna. Oh, my God. Mindy, are you pregnant? Eight weeks. Oh, that's great. And you were worried. Yay, Mindy, that's wonderful. Yay to the bump. Hmm. Oh, my God. Did I tell you? I almost met your guy's wife. - What? - Yeah. Well, since I'm pregnant, I moved from fertility to OB/GYN. And Dr. O'Neal recommends Carolyn Soule. And I remember that you said that Jack is married to her. So I check her out on urbanbaby. com. And I mean, she's like- people rave about her. Really? Yeah. She's, like, top three in Manhattan, I mean, at least on that website. Urbanbaby. com? Are you a little ashamed you didn't think of it yourself? No, I'm gonna meet her next week anyway. Holiday office party at their apartment. Well, I hope you meet their kid. That should knock this out of you. Happy holidays. Thanks. You too. Hmm. - Nice party. - So far. I'm keeping my eye on the paralegals and the open bar. Oh, Marilyn, there you are. Carolyn, happy holidays. Oh, I have something for you in the den. It's marked. You'll see it. So before you go. Thank you, Carolyn. Hello, I'm Carolyn Soule, Jack Woolf's wife. This is Emilia Greenleaf. She's new. Well, September. Thanks so much for inviting me here. Oh, well, of course. Marilyn and Carolyn. That's very good. Well, enjoy yourself. My friend wanted you to be her doctor, but you were all booked. She says you're the best. Oh, isn't that sweet? I wish it were true. Oh. Well, according to the internet. Well, don't let us keep you, Carolyn. Yes, don't forget- before you leave. Thank you, Carolyn. We put in an appearance. I'm heading downtown. You want to share a cab? It's only 10:00. Well, you know, usually the new people and the support staff leave these things early. Adult swim, so to speak. Well, I'm an associate, so I guess I'm gonna dive in. - Your tickets and itinerary. - What? Check your email. You're flying to Oakland tomorrow. Discovery production on the Jasper case. - But that's not my case. - It's Jack's. You don't want to go? Talk to him. He's business. You're coach. Policy. Wait, a partner's doing document production? Exactly. For the plane. So beautiful downtown Oakland, huh? Because of my dad, probably. He didn't make me, but as a judge's daughter, I guess you get to either be a lawyer or a criminal. Pia, my half-sister, is a lawyer too. Common cause. Your father was married before? Yeah, then my mother, his secretary. They're divorced now too. But they're friendly enough. I mean, you know, with the grandkids and everything. Was that hard for you? I was 22, so, you know... but they're much better off apart. Better for my mother anyway. She gave up everything for him. The good wife. Wives were a great thing. Everyone needs one. My wife more than me, maybe. I don't need a wife. I don't even want to get married. I'm practically a guy. It doesn't show. This is me. Where are you? I'm on the spa level. But that's- we passed that on the way up. I know. I don't think I can do anything else right now. Is that okay? As long as you don't say that you're married, and you've never done this before, and you're afraid of hurting your wife. I'm married. And I've never done this before. And I am afraid of hurting my wife. Who doesn't understand you. Good night, Emilia. Good night. - It's crazy. - Oh, Will is so sweet. - He sounds really smart. - He is. You know, there's something I've been thinking about. I think we should move in together. - Emilia- - Just hear me out. I love you, and I know you love me too. I love you. I do. But I have a family. You have a son, Jack. You don't have a marriage. You've said that a lot. Okay, fine, I have a son. That's more than a marriage. And he's not the happiest kid. He's not unhappy. He just- he's lonely. It's bad when your kid is lonely. I mean, I used to think we should have had more for Will, mainly. But Carolyn- anyway, we- I'm glad we didn't. Screwing up one child is enough for a lifetime. I'm done. What? Emilia. I'm on the pill. I don't understand. Look, don't- don't worry about it, okay? It's early. It's, like, eight weeks or something, so it won't be a problem. No. To Emilia and Jack. May their marriage be long and fruitful. Well, fruitful we can do. I'm so glad you came. Thank you. It's so soon. No, it's good for me to get out of the house. And I'm so happy that you're expecting. Don't think I'm envious, honestly. This is gonna be you before you know it. Hmm. I know. We're already trying, so- Wow, that's so quick. That's great. How long have your father and Jack known each other? Oh, we all had dinner together last month just before the divorce came through. But they got along right away. They have private jokes already. Hmm, well, they're a day away from wearing each other's clothes just for fun. Well, we all end up marrying our fathers, don't we? Yes, I only fuck men in shorts and black socks who make me join Little League. It's weird. Jack and my dad couldn't be more different. Jack's so principled. Have you met the kid yet? Saturday. But from Jack's stories, I get the feeling he's a little high-maintenance. Whatever. That's the one you want to please if you want this to work out. - Roy G. Biv. - Roy G. Biv. Jack. Red, orange, yellow, green. - Hi, guys. - Hi. Will, this is Emilia. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you too. This is for you. I got it at the Museum of Natural History next door. That's why I was late. Your dad told me it's your favorite place. There's no evidence that theropods were orange. Plus, I'm eight. Well, I guess it's not very realistic, huh? But there's also a book in there about Central Park, which is my favorite place since I was about your age. Anyway, thank you. You know, there's a show at 10:30. We should go. You may kiss the bride. Oh, good. William is upstairs. - Okay. - No, no, no. Dr. Soule says to wait here. I guess I'm a security risk. You're late. No, I am not late. Your father's late. He disappoints, because he was hoping to see his father. Me too. I disappoint too. Okay, William. See you Monday. Good-bye, Miss Emilia. When is my father coming home? By 8:00. That's, like, three hours, okay? - That sucks. - Don't say "sucks." Your mom's gonna think you heard it from me. I did hear it from you. William, why do we have to fight all the time? I just- let's have a nice time, okay? How about we get ice cream sundaes for supper, hot fudge? I want to eat one the size of your head. I'm lactose-intolerant. I could get very ill from eating ice cream. Okay. We'll just see whatever is in the fridge. Chinese, Thai, old and cold, but whatever. Rainbow sherbet- that's no dairy- or sorbet: lemon, lime, coconut, and peach. Everything else has dairy. Oh, I guess I'll have sorbet. Lemon. No, he'll have a hot chocolate and a banana split. You want strawberry sauce or chocolate? I can't have that. I'm lactose-intolerant. No, you have that powder here, right, don't you, that takes care of lactose-intolerance? Yeah? Yeah, William, they have this powder here, and you sprinkle it all over your ice cream. And you don't even taste it, but you can have whatever you want that way. My mother isn't convinced that kind of lactase works. William, please, it's science. He'll have the strawberry sauce, please. No, chocolate. And my ice cream flavors are chocolate, chocolate chip, and cookie dough. It's melting. You better hurry. You want it? I think I'll have this next time, 'cause my banana was a little brown at the end. You want it? Oh, I'm good. Thank you. Emilia, how old is that baby? Excuse me, is your baby two, three months? Oh, seven weeks. December 26th. Seven weeks, December 26th. Did you know that Isabel was never really a person? What? She was never really a person. In Jewish law, it says that a baby is not a person until it's at least eight days old. And Isabel was only three days old when she died. So that means she was never really a person. Where did you hear that? My mother. I told her I was a little sad about Isabel, but not as sad as if I've known her for a long time, like she had time to be my real little sister. So then my mom told me how, in the Jewish law, she was never really a person. So now I don't have to feel so bad about not feeling so sad. Well, Isabel was a real person. She was every bit as much of a person as you are. My mom said she was surprised they even let us have a funeral. We're going. Come on. Let's go. Hey, you forgot to pay! That was fun, wasn't it? Yeah. It's good to share things together, like, you know, secrets and stuff. It's fun. I'm not supposed to have secrets from my mom. It's not a secret. It's just private. There's a difference. We can have private things together. Everyone does. Like tomorrow. Tomorrow don't go having ice cream in front of your dad, okay? Not that my sister will have any. She probably only has the soy stuff. I don't want to go to that stupid party. It's your cousin's birthday. No, she's your niece, not my cousin. Nono will be there. You like Nono. You call him your grandpa, and he isn't, so... But sometimes when it's just you and me, we can still get ice cream, right? Only if it's just between the two of us. - Deal? - Deal. After the party, can Emilia and I go to the park? Maybe go where we went yesterday, Emilia? Well, um, okay, William. Maybe. But be cool, fool. Uh, totally, dude. What's with you two? Private joke. Uh-huh. Private, not secret. There's a difference. Is there? Ugh! Sweet old grandpa routine? I just don't believe it. Yeah, well, the kids do. And they usually sniff out bullshit pretty well. Oh, hey, your mom called. She's running late. Dad, Jack's already waiting. Go. Where are they going? Oh, we ran out of Rice Dream. Hey, kiddo. You hungry? No, I had lots already. I love hummus. We made it in school on Middle Eastern day. Both Arabs and Israelis eat it. Yes, it's the hope of the world, hummus. Honey, can you take this up to the rec room to the kids? Put it on the table with the cookies. The non-dairy has a cow with the line through it, okay? Do I have to? I don't know anyone. Well, you know Josh and Emma. Okay, look. If you have no fun, in ten minutes, you can come back down. That's 11:28. There's a digital clock up there, okay? I prefer analog. Okay, now you have to wait till 11:29. Scoot. You look good, better. Better than what? We brought this for Emma. I can't believe she's five already. Oh, my God. Developmental K next year, Greenpoint. They've got this incredible bilingual program. I can't believe you're taking William out of his school. It's so great. Yeah, but it's public, and it's what Jack wants. So now I got to please her. I bet she'll choose whatever private school is most expensive. Well, I hope you choose wisely. Don't get me wrong. I mean, William is a sweet kid, but he could use a little rough-and-tumble. - You know what I mean? - I don't know. It's the East Side, but it is public. I mean, there's black and Asian kids in his class. Diversity is one of their things. Experiencing rich people of all colors is not diversity. We're not rich, Pia. We're comfortable. Honey, your doorman is comfortable. - Hmm. - Mommy! Come quick. It's William. What? What's the matter? Is he okay? William? He won't move. William, did you have an accident? Gross. I think it's diarrhea. - Oh, no. - Just go away. I don't want you. I want my dad. - Is he here? - He went to the store. Then Nono. No, they went to get Rice Dream. Oh, no. William, I think this- Please, I don't want you. Leave me alone. Honey, why don't you give me a shot, okay? You want to go downstairs? I'll take you downstairs. I'm gonna pop him in the bath, okay? Here, let me help you. Great, get the cake ready. The candles are in the drawer by the stove. Don't worry. Good job, pal. He's upstairs watching a movie. Fine, just embarrassed. Some of the kids made fun of him, which didn't help. It's my fault that he had diarrhea. He's lactose-intolerant, and I gave him ice cream. What? Why? Because I didn't really believe that he was lactose-intolerant. I thought Carolyn was just being controlling. I know. I'm a terrible person. You're not a terrible person. You're just not used to kids. It takes time. No, you know what it takes? A kid. Em, I didn't mean- Is that okay? I'm gonna go to the car. I told her Mom said that powder doesn't work for me. It doesn't matter, Will. You just won't be having ice cream again. So it doesn't matter. Hey, hey. I'll take a rain check. I'm kind of beat. Okay. Sorry I'm late. Wow, you look nice. Is that new? No. Thank you, honey. I just had my hair done. Take your time, sweetie. I'm sorry I missed you yesterday at Pia's. I heard about Will. Poor baby. He's better today, but I'm expecting a hysterical phone call from Carolyn as soon as he tells her. She's gonna love this. Emilia screws up again. Well, you couldn't know. Pia feels terrible. Six kids, not including Will. That's seven. I'm not surprised they got sick. I'm just surprised seven kids tried hummus. I mean, she scares them into it. - That's what it was? - She said she told you. Em, you've got to check your machine, honestly. We have to tell him. Well, what did you think it was? Hi, I need to speak to William Woolf, please. I'm sorry, how did you- I'm Emilia Greenleaf. I'm his stepmother. It's important. I know who you are, Miss Greenleaf, but unless it's a medical emergency, we don't allow visits. It's distracting. I can give him a message at recess. Okay, tell him six other kids got sick yesterday, so it wasn't the ice cream. It was the hummus. All right. Not the ice cream. The hummus. It's important. Have a nice day. - It went okay? - Yeah, I think. We'll know if we get one of her calls. Don't let me forget to pick up something for your father today. His birthday is in a month. Mom, you should forget his birthday. It's been seven years. It doesn't kill me to buy him a card. Hallmark has that covered? "Happy birthday. Thanks for cheating on me." Emilia. I'm worried about you. Simon is too. I'm fine. Look, I know what you're going through. My miscarriage was just like a child dying. Really? Then isn't abortion the same thing too? I mean, I think there's a difference between a fetus and a baby. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Mindy. I just- I'm all right, really. Time heals, and I just need the days to pass for a while. No, no, you need to take an active role in your own grief. That's what saved me. I want you to come with us on the remembrance walk. What, that thing you did in November? Yes, we're doing a small one next month. I don't think that walking in Central Park with a bunch of people with candles who lost their babies is really gonna help. You don't know that, okay? It saved my life. - I'm glad. - Look, here. Just take the pamphlet, okay? If you're not interested, I'll drop it. But I really think it would help. And you need help, seriously. Is she expecting you home at any particular time? Will dinner be waiting? I'm gonna pick up William early on Friday, at 3:00 here instead of 5:00 at your place. I got tickets to The Lion King for Friday night, and I thought we'd make a day of it. He's already seen The Lion King. He can see it twice. We hear from the schools on Friday. Great. Call me, let me know where he's going. I'd like to tell him myself. William and I went through the whole process together. I went on all the interviews with him. I really think I should be the one who tells him. Fine. You can tell him. William and I chose Collegiate together, and when he gets in, we will celebrate together. He knows the letters are coming on Friday. - He'll be waiting to find out. - Then meet us here. Or wait till Monday. Either way, I'm picking him up early. You realize the message you're sending. And what would that be, Carolyn? Mr. Woolf, Dr. Soule. Miss Johnson, thank you so much for rescheduling this appointment. It really would be much easier if we didn't both have to be here at the same time. Well, it's our policy, when possible. Now, before I walk you through William's evaluation- What are those? Oh, aren't they lovely? We're doing a unit on family structure. The children all drew pictures of their families. We're so lucky to have such- Where's William's? William, in particular, um, found this to be very helpful with... It's how kids process things. Carolyn- Dr. Soule, please. This is not his family. What are you doing? This is my classroom. I will not allow you to destroy things in my classroom. May I? That is not his family, Jack. It is now. I'm sorry. We should just move on with the evaluation. I'll tell my wife. My ex-wife. I hate that one. It's the last one we took. I didn't realize you'd seen these. I'm... This is my favorite. I framed it. I look terrible. I'm all blotchy. You look like a woman who just had a baby. You aren't mad at me? What for? For stealing the pictures and getting them printed and not telling you and hiding them here? You think I'd forget we'd taken them? I just ordered another set and had them delivered to the office. This one's on my desk. Of course I'm not mad. You should be. I'm not. Not my favorite. She's got that Popeye thing going on. One eye open, one eye closed. You look nice. You look happy. I was. The day Isabel was born and the day William was born were the happiest days of my life. Can you meet me tomorrow at Will's school? - I want to show you something. - Okay. A surprise. Yeah. Hello. Yes. Carolyn, I don't know if you remember me. I know who you are. Is Jack inside? Yeah, he'll be down in a minute. All right. This is all your fault. Will has been so distracted and tense and emotional. I'm sure they sensed that in the interviews. What? You just won't be happy until you've ruined everything. I don't know what the hell happened to you to make you so destructive. Jack. He didn't get in. - He didn't get in? - No, uh-uh. Not Collegiate, not even wait-listed. All right, just calm down, Carolyn. Oh, I'm calm. Would you like me to not care? Should I be more like you? Well, he can always stay here. I mean, it's not the end of the world. No, it's certainly not the end of your world. You don't give a shit. But it's a disaster for Will. He didn't get in anywhere. Not Collegiate, not Dalton, not Trinity. - You know what? This is not the time. - Not the U.N. international school. Do you know where he got in? Do you know who took him? - West Side Prep. - That's a great school. - Will, that's great, really. - It's his safety school, Jack. Do you know what a safety school is? - Yeah, I do. - Jack, I'm gonna take William home. We'll meet you there. - Should I go to the theater? - No. Home. I'll meet you at home. Don't worry, Will, okay? You don't care. - You don't fucking- - Of course I care. Don't touch me. Okay, just calm down, all right? You're really too old for The Lion King, anyway. I mean, it's pretty unscientific. Talking lions? Talking lion puppets, actually. You dodged a bullet, my friend. You want something to drink? Hey, easy. We're walking through the park. Your mom hates the bathrooms there. I can pee on a tree. I have a penis. You're the one who should be worried. You don't have one. Thank you for clearing that up. I can stop looking now. Come on, hurry up! Hey, um, do you skate? It's just wrong. We should rent helmets. Rollerbladers need helmets, and ice is just as hard as asphalt. Harder. Ice is not as hard as asphalt. Yes, it is. Much harder. Actually, asphalt is quite soft. That's why my mom runs in the street and not the sidewalk. She knows that kind of thing. She's a doctor. Does she run with a helmet? You should mention that to her. My pediatrician's office has a safety wall in it. It has a picture of children on their rollerblades. My picture is there too. I'm on my tricycle wearing my blue helmet. I also have a red helmet. If we really want to do this, we can go home and get one of my helmets. Oy, with the helmets. It looks bigger than 33,000 square feet. How do you know how big Wollman Rink is? It's in that book you gave me, you know, the Central Park book? Oh. I didn't know you read it. Pretty cool, huh? Come on. Hat. Watch out! See? At the speed he's going, he needs one. - This is very scary. - No, it's not. Yes, it is. You can't say what's scary to me. Only I can. You're not scared, because you know how to skate. And that boy's not scared, because his mother brought his helmet. Which probably means he's scared of her. Here, give me your hand. Good. This isn't so awful, is it? I just want to go back to the wall. That was much better. You just need to get used to it. No, you just go skate. I do better if no one is watching. Okay, I'm gonna go around once, and you try and balance, okay? Go on. Okay. Whoa, whoa! William! William, just stay right there. I'll help you get up, okay? I'm good. Whoa! Shit. If you say "helmet," I'm gonna leave you here. Wrist pad. Come on. Okay, let's go. - Whoa! - Are you kidding me? It's just, Collegiate was the best school. No, it isn't. It's snooty. Plus, Collegiate is all boys. Who wants to go to an all-boys school? Well, if you go to Collegiate, you can go to Harvard. A: not guaranteed. B: West Side Prep sends tons of boys to Harvard. And C: you're eight. You don't have to think about Harvard. Harvard sucks. You went to Harvard. Exactly. Well, that's true. But still, I thought I'd get in. Dude, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. My mom is mad at me. She's mad, but not at you. She's mad at me and at your dad and everything, but it only feels like she's mad at you. You don't understand. You don't understand about Collegiate or anything. You're from New Rochelle. You not sophisticated like me and my mom are. You're feeling better, huh? You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna stop at Fairway on the way home, and I'm going to make you a homemade stir-fry and Tofutti sundaes, and we're gonna watch a movie that will shrivel your young brain. How's that sound? Only if I can let go of the wall down there. You don't have to. Only if I can let go of the wall. Right on. One more try. This is done? What next? You can peel the ginger. We only need this part like that. Okay, just that? That's it? Just the skin off. Not too much. - We don't need that much. - Okay, but like this? Uh-uh, just the corner, though. All right. Hey. - Dad, hey. - Hey. I'm sorry about The Lion King. It's okay. I'm so proud of you. You got into a great school. What does Mom say? She says you're gonna love it there. And she's very happy. Right. Hey, Will, show your dad the flyer. Oh, there's a movie in the park. It's Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile. That was my favorite book when I was a kid. Remember? Uh, yeah, a long time ago. But yeah, I kind of remember. Yeah, they're shooting a scene at the zoo, and they need kid extras. Both Emilia and I can be in it. I can be a kid, and Emilia can be a mom. And it was my favorite book too when I was your age, which is pretty weird. Meant to be. So what's all this? Well, Will wanted a real stir-fry, not takeout. - Mm-hmm. - Jump in. Sure. You got to wash your hands first. And you have to sing Happy Birthday twice while you're doing it. Otherwise you don't kill all the bacteria. Got it. Hey, Will, why don't you show your dad the DVDs we got today? Oh, they're in my room. I already previewed them. I want to start with Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park? Not the day I planned. Carolyn's insane. She needs a Valium drip or patch... or four. I guess it's the hormones or something. I mean, first there were the shots, and now that she's... Oh. Carolyn's pregnant. Carolyn's- oh, shit! You okay? Carolyn's pregnant? How can she be pregnant? She's 43. Well, she's 42, but she's been seeing someone since summer. No, she hasn't. Will would have told us. Well, he told me, and he doesn't know about the baby. She wanted to wait until she passed the three-month mark to tell him. How pregnant is she? I don't know, seven, eight weeks. Something like that. She told me when we lost Isabel. It made her realize that she wanted another child. She got pregnant right away. She got pregnant because of Isabel? Your ex-wife got pregnant because my baby died? Not because she died. Because she saw how much we loved her. Emilia, this is a good thing, like something good came out of Isabel's death. She didn't die in vain. That is not why she died, so that Carolyn could have another baby. - No, you don't understand. - Oh, fuck you! That is not why she died. That's not a good enough reason. Will. Oh, fuck. Oh, a good movie always makes me feel better. What's with you? - What do you mean? - You seem happy. Do I? I'm not. I mean, I'm the same. I liked that movie, though. Didn't you? No. I hate it when the heroine is beautiful, but she can't get a date. Why does everything have to be so stupid? Oh, sweetie, I know. But you'll feel better. It'll take time, but it will happen at home with Jack. I really think I'm gonna have to kick you out tomorrow. 24 hours is enough time to punish a man for his ex-wife getting pregnant. Why did you like that movie? It's a romance. You should have been angry at it. The guy's a creep, and then he says "sorry." And then everyone forgives him, but people aren't like that. Some people are. Sometimes good things happen. Did you meet someone? Is that what this little black dress is about? No. I have not met anyone. No one new, anyway. Oh, my God. Mr. Benvenuti. When we drove out today, he was chopping wood all show-offy. Mama, his wife just died. It's not Mr. Benvenuti. Emilia, you're not gonna believe this, but I spent some time with your father Thursday night. What? Well, we've been talking more since your wedding, and I guess you could say we had a first date. Mom, why do you think he's changed? He has not changed. I don't think he's changed. I think there's just as much and as little to him as there always was. You're just gonna pretend like nothing happened? No, I'm gonna stop pretending that was the only thing about him. You're on your own, both of you. - Enjoy yourself. - Emilia. Sonia, I thought this was my day. Dr. Soule said she was going to call you. No, no, Sonia. No, don't talk to her. No, can you move away, please? - William, wait in the car. - Carolyn, this is my day. Oh, no, you don't have any more days, Emilia. I've just spoken to the principal. If Jack wants to pick him up, that's fine. Otherwise, it's Sonia. Well, I don't know what William told you, but- My pregnancy is my business, not yours. Well, then maybe you shouldn't have told Jack. I'm only six weeks along. Anything could happen. He'd be crushed. Not that it would make any difference to you. It's very clear you don't care about him. That's not true. I like William very much. Not enough to make sure he's wearing a helmet when he's skating. Not enough to take his food allergy seriously. Yes, that's right. I heard about that, Emilia. Maybe it's subconscious, but it's obvious you wish he weren't here. Now you're just being paranoid. Oh, am I? Am I? Because I've never had anything to fear from you, right? You're so innocent, so well-intentioned, such a safe young woman to invite into my home. You have no right to see Will alone. I'm going to take care of that legally. Your relationship is with his father, not him. But I'm his stepmother. That's nothing, less than nothing. And if you ever hurt him again, so help me God, I will have you arrested for child abuse. Dr. Soule, please. Children aren't safe around you, Emilia. I think we've proven that. Stay away from mine. Let's go. Come on. No, Carolyn, Carolyn. Are you serious? No, absolutely not. She does not. Okay, you know what? I'm done. That's it. You don't have to like it. That's the agreement. Well, luckily, it's not up to you. Yeah, okay, great. Good luck with that. Yeah, bye. Guess you've heard. Yeah, I heard. She's gonna go to court. No, she's not gonna go to court. You're gonna pick him up every Wednesday, same as before, and take a cab here. Okay. And he's coming Saturday to the remembrance walk with us, the three of us. How do you know about that? Your mother told me. Mindy called her. I would like us all to go. Look, I don't even know if I want to go. So he certainly doesn't have to. Yes, he does. She was his sister. We're all going. This is a family. If Carolyn has to buy it, so do you. Jack, I didn't tell him on purpose. He overheard both of us. This isn't my fault. Oh, I know. Nothing is your fault, right? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Everything just happens, right? Everything just fucking happens. Emilia? Ready? Emilia Woolf and Jack and William. I registered online. Hi, I'm Janet. Here we are. And what is your angel's name? Isabel. Isabel GreenleafWoolf. December 27th to the 30th or- do you want the day that she was born or- 12/27? That's my stepson's name. I love that name. We called him Billy. He died of SIDS. I'm sorry. I know Billy's here whenever I think of him. Don't you feel that about Isabel? She's gone. I know the difference between here and gone. The candles and the cones are for down by the pond. We'll tell you when to light them. We light them together. There are blue and pink balloons and white. Take this. You'll float this in the pond at the end. It'll just melt away after a minute or so. I'm sorry I said that. No, it's fine. Really. Emilia. I found your mom and dad. - My dad's here? - Mm-hmm, over there with Will. I'm so sorry we're late. Traffic and then parking. You know your father. He'll never just put the car in the lot. You told him about the walk? No, I did when he called last week. He invited me. I found out your mother was going. I thought we'd come together. Are Ben and Pia here? I didn't invite them. Aren't you gonna put your heart thing on? I only have three. You can have mine. I can go get some more with Nono. Thank you. You okay? Welcome, everyone, to this special walk for remembrance and hope. If you happen to lose your group for any reason, you'll be able to find us at our destination. We try to observe silence during the walk until the end. Hey. Hey, Jack. Hi. I'm proud of you. I know this is hard, but it'll be worth it. I promise. "Death is nothing at all. "I have only slipped away into the next room. "I am I, and you are you. "Put no difference in your tone. "Wear no forced air of solemnity and sorrow. Play, smile..." Where are they? Who? My father and- there. Emilia. What are you doing? We're practicing our dance steps for the movie. I'm gonna be Lyle. Remember how you and I used to dance like Lyle and Signor Valenti when you were little? They're gonna start soon. I think we should go. Right, right. I think I might be in this Lyle movie too, huh? If they need an old grandpa type. You're not a grandpa type. Not his, anyway. Okay. I think they're starting, huh? What are you doing here? We just didn't want to interrupt, you know, with our nonsense. No, why did you bother coming here at all? You know why I came here. I came for you, for Jack, to support you. Mom's here to support me. Will, you want to walk over with me? She was my granddaughter. I'm here for Isabel. Don't you dare say her name. - Emilia. - Will, let's go. Do you want to do this, or do you want to go home? I will not allow you to speak to me- - You won't allow me? - What are you doing? You know why my parents got divorced, Jack? I didn't tell you. I didn't tell anyone. You don't even know I know. Emilia, shut up. My father was spending $1,000 a month on a Russian stripper. Sheldon Greenleaf: judge/sex addict. Come on, Sheldon. Let's go. Come on, just walk. You don't have to chase me away. I'll just go, if you want. Okay. Thanks, Simon. Um, I'm still gonna put my hearts in the water, so... I'll call you later. For more than seven years, he's traveled the globe, chasing tornadoes on the rampage. Hey. What you watching? Some storm chasers thing. Is it any good? Will, I'm really sorry about what happened today in the park. I guess I just lost it. I'm kind of watching this. Okay. Sleep well. I'm sorry, Jack. I can't do this anymore. The whole thing just freaked me out with the hearts and the candles and ectopic pregnancies with names. It's not a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, Emilia. I know. I know. Isabel's death doesn't make it okay for you to hurt people. I know that. No, I don't think you do. I'm gonna ask you a question. - Jack, please. - I want you to answer it. Do you know why you fell in love with me? When I first saw you, it was... it was like I recognized you. Yeah. Recognized me. That's probably right. Your father, Emilia. That's who you recognized. You are nothing like my father. Are you kidding me? I'm just like him. Jack. I'm a lawyer. I'm a cheater. I left my family just like he did. Jack, I don't want to fuck my father, okay? I fell in love with you. And you fell in love with me too. - We couldn't help it. - And that makes it okay? It's not the two of us fucking things up? That's the last thing I'd want to do. That's what he did. My father betrayed me. No, he didn't betray you. He betrayed your mother. - That's the same thing. - It's not the same thing. Children are not their mothers, Emilia. William is not Carolyn. You don't get to hate him. I don't hate William. You should see your face when you look at him. You're cold, Emilia. Cold. He's a child. He needs to be protected. And maybe we both fucked that up. Maybe I did more than you. Yeah, by letting him near me, right? Oh, come on. Just say what you really mean, Jack. - This is about Isabel. - This is not about Isabel! Not everything in the fucking world is about Isabel. She was my daughter too. Losing her broke my heart too! Losing her? We didn't lose her, Jack. I killed her. What are you talking about? Remember? You told me to put her in the bassinet? And I said I would when she finished. And then you fell asleep, and I was so tired. But she had finally started feeding, so she was fine. I fell asleep again. Then something woke me up. And she was gone. Isabel. Isabel! Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! She's not- she's not breathing! She's not breathing! She's not breathing! Isabel. - What do we do? - Call 911. What do we do? I told you and I told the police that I found her in the bassinet, but... I lied. She fell asleep in my arms. I had her head in my hands and her face pressed against me. I- I fell asleep. No. You did not smother her. I did, Jack. You know I did. You knew she wasn't in the bassinet, didn't you? No, the autopsy report said that she died of natural causes. It said that she died of SIDS. No, the medical examiner said she stopped breathing. And the reason she stopped breathing was 'cause she couldn't. No, you- you didn't- she wasn't crushed. The autopsy report said specifically that she wasn't crushed. I didn't crush her, Jack. I smothered her. You're a lawyer, Jack. Argue me out of it. It's not just you. I can't do this anymore either. I got it. Are you okay? Taxi! You looked like you saw a ghost back there. It's just, you're never up here. That's all. Oh, I was waiting for Will. We made plans to be in that movie together in the park. How is he? He didn't show. I guess his mother said no. Jack told me you left home. You plan on going back? I don't think I'm really very good for that family. Look, I was not a very good husband. But I am not a bad person. I didn't think that at the time. I thought, "I'm not fit to be here." So I didn't fight when your mother told me to go. I didn't fight for her. I didn't fight for you. Don't make the same mistake I made. My mistakes have happened, and I've been punished. Isabel's not dead because you needed to be punished. Then why is she dead? I don't know. I don't know. She stopped living. That's all. Is that what you want? - You want to stop living? - I want her back. That's not one of your choices, honey. I'm sorry. That would be my choice too. I'm sorry for what I said, what I said about you. I don't know why. It's okay, honey. It's all okay, hmm? Hello? Oh. Yeah? This afternoon? Okay. Yeah, I know where the office is. Okay. Miss Greenleaf? Jack told me you moved out. You talked to him? Yes, I did. William was very upset to see you leave with your suitcase. You never understood that children have eyes, have you? I called Jack to talk about it, and he told me what happened the night Isabel died. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. He asked if it was possible that you could have smothered her with your breast- my medical opinion. What did you tell him? I told him, yes, it was possible. Yes, you could have accidentally killed Isabel. You probably had. Any woman who's so casual with William's safety could just as easily have fallen asleep and smothered her own child. William was very mad at me. He said I should be ashamed of myself. He's very loyal, William. He knows? Yes, well, he overheard the conversation. I'm sorry. My apartment's quite small. Your apartment's huge. You must have been shouting. He said that you loved Isabel and that you couldn't have killed her. And I told him I hadn't said that you'd killed the baby. I told him that you might have accidentally smothered her. Carolyn, why am I here? I'd really like to leave. William asked me to help you. He said because I'm a doctor, I could find out what really happened to Isabel. I didn't realize he cared, since she wasn't a person, you know, according to the Jewish law. Your pediatrician got a copy of the autopsy report. I know. Well, I had his office fax it to me yesterday, and I reviewed it with a classmate of mine from Stanford. She's a pathologist who specializes in neonatal cases. She testifies in criminal trials. And she confirms the coroner's conclusion. I know the official verdict: SIDS. I asked for more specific conclusions, and she said there's absolutely no evidence to suggest that Isabel was smothered. Smothering always leaves traces: a torn upper lip frenulum, signs of positional asphyxia, dots of blood in the lungs, and in Isabel's case, there was no evidence that she'd been smothered. So you can't have smothered her. You didn't kill your baby. She died of SIDS. You just had the misfortune of holding her when she died. Your friend's a pathologist? A perinatal specialist. Yeah, she's 100% secure in her conclusions that Isabel died from SIDS. Based on the facts, it's scientifically impossible that she died from smothering. Are you listening? She also said she'd speak with you if you'd rather hear it from her directly or if you have any other questions. I need to know that you understand what I'm saying, so I'm going to repeat this until you say that you understand. You didn't kill your child, Emilia. You didn't kill your baby. Your baby died because babies do sometimes. They just slip away for no reason. It's no one's fault. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Do you understand? I understand. Good. I'm gonna leave you alone for a while. - Hi. - Hi. I've-I just came from Carolyn's office. And she told me I couldn't have killed Isabel. She had her pathologist look at the medical report. Sit down. I really think you should call her and hear what she has to say, because I didn't do it. I never thought you did. But your face, your face when I told you and your face the night that she died- How should I look, Emilia, when my daughter dies, when my wife says she killed her? People have their own feelings. I talked to my father, and I apologized to him. And you were right. You were right. I've been working through things in our relationship that are really about him and my family and things- Emilia, don't. None of this matters. We are not a mistake. You're my family, and I want to be with you. William's my family. And me, William and me. I love William. Em, please. He loves me. He made his mother find out. He loves me. I know. It's the people who love you you're the hardest on. I'm sorry. I just can't. That's how it is. Okay. No, no, no, Marilyn. I don't need to talk to him. You can just let him know that I'll stop by the apartment tomorrow around noon, okay? And I'll leave the keys with the super. And to answer his email, no, I don't want any of the baby stuff. He can sell it. eBay, whatever. I don't know. Yeah, seriously. Thank you. Jack? Hi. He does? Uh, where are you? Hey, Will. What's up? Well, his mother's getting married today. And he wouldn't leave the house without me, and now he won't go inside without you. Let me guess. When I moved out three weeks ago, did you think your dad was gonna move back in with your mom? Sort of. Since you were done being married, they could be done being divorced. But it's not working out that way, is it? She's marrying somebody else. Yeah. That's hard. Not everything works out the way you hope. What can you do? Will, help me out here, bud. Why'd you ask to see me? I would have thought I'd be the last person you'd want to see. Well, Sonia's in New Jersey. But she's not family. And I figured, you're my sister's mom. And that's family. Right? I will always be your sister's mom. Then how come you don't live with us anymore? Well, because... I don't belong with you guys. It's like Lyle the Crocodile. Lyle doesn't belong in an apartment. He belongs with all the other crocodiles at the Central Park Zoo. There are no crocodiles there, only caimans. It's a metaphor, William. You know metaphors. What I'm trying to say is, I'm sort of like Lyle. You know, I don't belong with you and your dad, 'cause, you know, my teeth are too sharp and my tail is too long. But Lyle does so belong with his family. They love him, even though he's a crocodile, even when he's not always the nicest or not so good with children. Lyle was always nice to children. It's a metaphor, Emilia. Thanks, Will. It's a really good one. So what do you say, Will? You ready to do this? Let's not ruin her day, okay? Not bad. I mean, you look miserable, but not bad. That's what I shoot for. Come on. - She'll hold our time, won't she? - I'm sure. Oh, thank God. What happened? Why is Emilia here? Never mind. Let's go. We're late. We were due in Judge Jody's chambers ten minutes ago. We have to run. Thank you. Anytime. What are you doing now? Getting fired, probably. I've been working at Simon's legal aid thing. It's day six, and I've been AWOL twice. I meant- I thought maybe we could have dinner or take a walk or something. Are we allowed? Yeah. We are. So I said, "Really? Because the Big Bang is older than the Bible and..." Come on. I'm telling a story. What are you carrying? Nothing. Plus, I'm 100. Wait. Anyway, I said that the Big Bang was older than the Bible. Then Michelle, Burton, and Kimberly said that I was gonna go to hell. Is there a hell? There are several. Your classroom is one of them. Let's sit down for a minute. My feet are killing me. These shoes. My mom says you always have very comfortable-looking shoes on. She says everyone in New Rochelle does. Here, this is for you. Open it. It's the one from Isabel's room. Nono gave it to me when I was ten. And now I'm giving it to you. It's better than a new one. Let's go see if it still works. Most people don't know it, but the real name for the boat pond is the Conservatory Water. Hmm, interesting. It's a birthday present. But my birthday's not until next month. It's 32 days away. It's a birthday present for you, but it's not for your birthday. It's for somebody else's birthday. Think. - Blair? - Yeah. He was born while I was at school? Seven pounds, three ounces. Your dad and I will take you to see him tonight. Blair Soule-Tolliver first. And I'm William Soule-Woolf first. We're both first, and we have the same middle name. I know. You've told me about 600 times. I'll have to make a new family portrait with Blair in it. You never saw the one I did. No, I did. It was beautiful. I made Isabel an angel. Even though I don't really believe in angels, I thought it would make you feel better. It did. Thank you. What do you think happened to Isabel when she died? I don't know. I guess I think she just stopped being. I think that whatever made her different from everybody else just disappeared when she did. No. We're doing religions in school, and Buddhists believe in reincarnation. That means when someone dies, they come back as someone else. And you might see that dead person someday and think to yourself, "Hey, I really like that person." But you don't know why. I don't really believe in that. I do. I'm gonna be a Buddhist. And I'm probably gonna be alive for a long time. So I'll probably run into her. So I'll always keep my eyes open. When I find her, do you want me to tell you? I'd really like that. You do that. I love my boat, Emilia. Thanks for the birthday present. Happy Blair's birthday, William. I love you. I know. Me too.
