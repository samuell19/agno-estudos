[MUSIC PLAYING] [COWBOYS WHISTLING] COWBOY: Woo hoo! COWBOY: Hiya! [GUNFIRE] -Throw this pack on the front, I will throw it behind. [GUNSHOTS] [CATTLE LOWING] [GUNFIRE] COWBOY: Woo hoo! -Hiya! Get up! [WOMAN SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] -Come now, the plan is to fire, vamoose, pronto! The rangers will come. COWBOY: Get up! [WHISTLING] COWBOY: Woo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Hiya! Woo! Ah! Rope her! Get up! -Dad! Dad? -This trail has been used but yesterday. I wonder where it does lead, andale. -You're home early, Pop. -Yup, ain't no need to staggering around out there any longer. The old claim's petered out, Ruby. I reckon we better head for town. -Well, that suits me all right. How would you like me to make you some lunch? -And am I hungry. Say, I could eat a whole pan of beans, including the can. [LAUGHING] -One horse, one mule. There is water there. We may need this place. Stay here. Buenos dias, senor. I hope I do not intrude. -Now listen, hombre. I don't talk no flowery language and I'm too tired to make any bows. So, let's get right to the point. Who are you? And what do you want? -Ho, ho, ho, ho. You amuse me greatly, senor. I am come but to beg permission to water my horse. You see I am your neighbor. -Neighbor? -Si, senor. I live but a few miles beyond you. My name is Don Yorba. -I ain't refused anybody any water, so help yourself. -You're very kind, senor. Do you live here alone? -Sometimes! This is our neighbor, Don Yorba, Ruby. -How do you do, Mr. Yorba? -This is an unexpected pleasure, senorita. -You'll have to excuse me please, I've got some things on the stove. -Si, senorita. You have but one horse? -Yeah. -Tomorrow, senor, in exchange for the use of the water, I will bring to the senorita a thoroughbred pony. Is it a bargain? -You're welcome to the water, suit yourself about the horse. -It will be here tomorrow. Adios, amigo. There is plenty water. Also, a very young and beautiful senorita. Tomorrow we bring a horse to carry her away on. -Yeah, what about the old man? -The boys will attack the place, I will rescue the girl. And the old man, well, it is too bad, but he will be killed. Just another tragedy, just another romance, in the life of Pandro Zanti. Oh, Grandy! -What's wrong, child? What happened? -There were three of them. They're going to take me away. And they're planning to kill you. -There, there, now don't cry. Just tell what you heard. -So he's Pandro Zanti, eh? I got to get you out of here right away, Ruby. That grinning lizard's liable to be back, anytime. Let me see, now. I got it. I know just what we'll do. Come on! -I think maybe it is best we get some of the boys in the yards, and return today, no? When I signal, you'll know what to do. Oya! Amigo! They have smelled a rat and have vamoosed. -Hello, Yorba. Heading for town? -I bring the horse, but I find you gone. -Was Ruby there? -I have seen no one. -Shucks, she must have been up at the spring. See, I gotta go to town for provisions and had to leave her behind. -Bueno, you will, perhaps, bring me some bacon and flour, no. I would pay you well. -Give me a horse and I'll load him down for ya. -And in return for this, I will take good care of your granddaughter. -Well, I certainly appreciate your kindness. -Michael, the horse. -So long. See you later. -The old fool. We will not only get his provisions, but ours as well. Come, I go to carry away my new romance. -They'll be watching us, Ruby. We gotta keep going. -OK, pop, I'm all right. -We gotta cross the river. -Go ahead, I'll get out of this trouble. -Give me the glass, Joe. -There's a girl in the pack, and I can't swim. -The girl, she was in the pack! RUBY: Uh! -Son, them's renegades after my girl. And I'd sure appreciate your help. -Certainly, old timer. It's only three miles to town. Come on. -Well, I guess we're safe, Ruby, thanks to the stranger. -You suppose he's all right? -Well, I sure hope so. He'll be coming for his horse soon, I reckon. Some animal. -Looks like a thoroughbred. -He is a thoroughbred, ma'am. -Well, stranger, I guess Ruby and me just about owe you our lives. -Ah, you don't owe me anything, but tell me, what was it all about? -Well, sir, this morning a stranger rode up to the house, and he says to me, he says-- -A stranger butted in and they got away. -Ride back and get the rest of the boys. We have very important business in town tonight. -And sure enough, they trailed us. I convinced them that I'd left Ruby behind. Everything was all right until we crossed the river. -Well, what was this stranger's name? -Call's himself, Pandro Zanti. -Zanti! DUSTY: Yeah. -If I'd only known. I'd like to meet him, face to face. -Well, son, I can fix that up for you. In return for your kindness today, I'll take you right where you can find him. You see, I got a cabin down on the edge of the town. You can put up there. Besides, I want you to meet the sheriff. -Now this man, Zanti, is the worse outlaw the state has ever known, half white, half Apache Indian. He poses as a Mexican, speaks the language, but he's not a Mexican. -The town's about deserted. -Bueno, go ahead. I will be waiting. -Now I think the best plan is to split up. Make temporary camps about 10 miles apart along the desert. We're sure to spot him sooner or later. -John Tobin, here, and me were heading out that way in the morning. -Well, $5,000. is worth going after. [GUNSHOTS] -Hey, everybody, duck! Don't open that door. -I'm giving orders here. [GUNSHOT] SHERIFF: Stop there, or I'll plug you. So it's you, ay? What do you got here? And how did ya get it? -What difference does it make, as long as I've got it? -Might make a lot of difference. I'll take charge of this. -Nice, agreeable, and appreciative sheriff you got here. -Yeah. He started off all right, but he's sure gone to seed. -Now, boys, I'm suspicious of Tobin. How did he know it was Zanti? And how come he got this money without getting shot? I'm going to keep an eye on him. He and old Dusty are heading for the desert in the morning. I'm going to take a couple of boys and follow them. He might lead us right to Zanti. I tell you, I don't trust nobody. -Well, here it is, son. Pretty comfortable, too. Come here! -Well, an old mine tunnel. -It leads to the trail up above. Might come in mighty handy sometime in case of trouble. [HORSES APPROACHING] -Hi there, Dusty. Seeing as you got plenty of water, and this being government ground, I reckon I'll stay right here. -What a pleasant place this is going to be. -Well, your friend, Tobin's been gone five days now. Wonder where he's eating? -Took his grub with him. -Yeah, mighty funny, him skipping out of here without us knowing about it. Didn't leave no trail either. -Well, he likes to work alone. -That's his excuse. Dusty, you ain't smart. Now ten to one if I could have trailed him, he would have led me right to Zanti. [GUNSHOT] -Well! -Better take charge of him sheriff before I cheat the law. -So I finally captured you, eh? Come on! I reckon that will hold you. -I'm not so sure. -This is my business. I ain't never lost a prisoner yet. -Heh! You never had one to lose. -The boys will be back the day after tomorrow. We'll be taking you into town. You've been slick, cunning wolf, Zanti, but I finally got you. -You forget, Senor sheriff, wolves run in packs, and mine is not far behind. -I gotta get going, Dusty, because I got a growing desire to go over there and break him to pieces. -I know just how you feel, son. Tell Ruby I'll be home in a couple of days. -All right, old-timer. [GUNSHOT] -Dusty? -Drop that gun, Tobin. Unbuckle your belt. -Don't be a fool, Sheriff. The man who did this is getting away. -Yeah, the man what done this is right in front of me. I had you figured out right along. Hmm, shot him in the head, eh? What's this? I suppose you deny that's yours. Get your hands out here. Come on, get moving. [HANDCUFFS LOCKING] Two of a kind, eh? Own up, Zanti. This fellow double-crossed you and brought you in here just to get the reward. Is that it? -You're very wise, Senor Sheriff. -Sure I am. -Hello, boys. Glad you got here? Miller, run into town and tell the boys I got Zanti. And that ain't all. Tobin, here, killed old Dusty. Bring all the boys you can get, we might bump into Zanti's gang on the way to town. -OK, Sheriff! -Hank, you stay here and keep an eye on them. I'm going to Indian Springs and get Slim. -Ah! Ah! -Look out, Hank! [GUNSHOT] [THUD] -So that's how you got away to kill Dusty. -Your deductions are much better then the Sheriff's. -Ah, I knew you did it, all right. You're the only one that could have taken my knife. What did you come back for? -To wait for this opportunity. Soon you will be with your friend. And there will be only two left. The Senor Sheriff and his men will return from Indian Springs, I will be in ambush, then Zanti will go free. Senor, pleasant dreams. -Dusty! -There's two horses ready. Easy now, son. -Drink your fill, Zanti, it's poison. -If go back without him, my reputation is ruined. And they're holding him a prisoner over at your old place. -But I just can't believe he did it. -Sheriff caught him right in the act. Sure sorry, Miss Ruby. -Mighty strange how they broke out of here. I know, Zanti got out, broke the chain that held Tobin, overpowered Hank and then shot him. I always knew them two was in cahoots. -It's the girl. Why not stop her? If their holding Pandro we'll make them exchange prisoners. -No one to take care of you. -It seems to me you're doing very well. -Must be Zanti's gang. We've got to race for it. -The girl and hombre that got Pandro are just ahead of us. Come on boys, we've got them trapped. -You ain't getting no where this time. Hands up. -Just a minute there, Sheriff. Don't faint you, old fool. I ain't dead yet. -But that shot, and the knife? -Oh, shucks, I weren't shot. And as for the knife, it was only a scratch. The fellow that done it is inside. Come on! -Who's that? -That's a dead man called Zanti. He's the feller that knifed me. [KNOCKING] -What's that? ZANTI HENCHMAN: Hey, fellas! -Well, that's Zanti's gang. Go ahead and let him out, Sheriff. We'll help you. ZANTI HENCHMAN: Hey! [KNOCKING] Hey, fellas. We're in here. Hey, get us out! -All right. You men might just as well know I got ya. Come on out one at a time, your guns in your holsters and your hands reaching high. Tie 'em up again' that wall. Dusty, keep 'em covered. -You betcha! -Come on, get over there, get over there! -Hello, is this Sheriff Tobin? -Yes, Mrs. Tobin, this is the Sheriff. -And what would Sheriff Tobin like for his dinner tonight? -Let me tell him. Baked taters, big juicy steak smothered with onions, and a apple pie. -Boy, will I go for that. [MUSIC PLAYING]
