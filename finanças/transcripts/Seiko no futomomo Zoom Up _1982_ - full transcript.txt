Hurry up or I won't be able to catch the 8:04 commuter express. What's going on? Oh, good morning, Seiko. Did you sleep well? Um, I prefer Japanese tea. Cool, Seiko. Wear a nice outfit today. Nice! Good proportions. Oh, are you wearing the dark blue today? The one you bought in Akasaka. You bought that one in Harajuku. I'll eat first! PRODUCER: ROH MIURA SCRIPT: SHL-JSUKE KANEKO All right. Seiko, please wait for me! ZOOM UP SEIKOS THIGH CAST MAYUMITERASHIMA JUN UENO/ MARI KISHIDA YURI YAMANASHI MAYO MIYAMOTO/JUN HAMAGUCHI DIRECTOR: KC-DYL-J OHARA - Hi! - Good morning! 'T Popped! - What? - My cherry. It's too early for that kind of talk. "Virgin" is written all over yourface. It's hard to hide my purity. - I regret it. - Goody-two-shoes. Yes, I am a goody-two-shoes. I was yesterday, too. But my true colors show so easily. - What happened? - It's too early for that kind of talk. If you didn't want to tell me, you shouldn't have brought it up. Tell me! It'd be too shocking for you, Seiko. Don't underestimate me! I like shocking stuff. Just thinking about it makes me feel weak. What's wrong, Ms. Goody-tvvo-shoes? Ifeel like I'm being watched. That's just your wish to be raped. I feel itchy. Here you go! Hey, hurry up. We open at 3 o'clock. All right! This thick one belongs to a 21-year-old office worker. This soft one belongs to a 17-year-old high school girl. Don't cover your front. Ma'am, it's still afternoon. You just fucked that salesman, didn't you? - Any good ones? - Have a look. How disappointing. Can I use your room? Just for an hour. - Forwhat? - A crazy chick is after me. She loves sex. Come and peek in later if you want. I got a room, but it smells like semen. It saves us money, though. Ready? Who is this woman? The owner of this room loves her. She's pretty, right? She looks like a goody-two-shoes. Can't you wait a minute? I'm ready. Let's do it! I'll undress myself. You call that ready? At least kiss me! You're so rough. Yoshio. Kiss my breasts, too. Fine, Iguess. Like this? Here, too? Yoshio, I love you. I'll give you a special show. I don't like this pose. No. Don't come yet. What? He's gone already. Don't come yet. - Not yet. - I won't. I trained myself masturbating. Yoshio, I love you! Let's get married. Tell me you love me, Yoshio. Not yet. Don't come yet. Not yet. Seiko? Who is this guy? Thank you very much. Today's seminar was fun. I'd like to ask you about Lawrence's view of sex next time. I'd like to spend more time with you, but I have to prepare for tomorrow's lecture. Oh, I didn't mean anything by it. Good night. Good night. I feel so stupid for staying a virgin for her this long. What? Forget about her! She is a student of the prestigious Crystal Academy. You dropped out of photography school and work as a janitor in a bath house... ...and sometimes a waiter at a coffee house. She's out of your league. I'm going to cheat on her. She doesn't even care about you. That's not cheating. Stupid. All right. Wait right here. I enjoyed the lecture today. The camera guy is here. - Let's leave. - No, let's tease him. - No. - Come on. Yeah, come over quick. Hello. She's the one, right? Y- Ye s. Go get their order. - But... - Come on. Come on, go! 18 or 'I9. He's ripe and ready. Stop it. Hello. What would you like? Two ripe ones. Huh? Ripe ones? What do you want? Can you be with him today? What? He doesn't have any experience with women. So what? He's myjunior at school. What does that mean? I didn't think it'd be a big deal. - L'll make you a man. - What? H63'- I'll let you do her. She's been screwed a lot so her hole is pretty loose, but... No vvay. I don't believe it. - But... - What do you mean "but". I'm not like that! That's dirty. Dirty? Are you kidding me? Come on. W- Wait a minute! I have to work. Goodbye, slut. I'm just that kind ofvvoman. Yoshio made a total fool outta me. Junko, please wait. lam committed to one woman. Do it quickly. I'm cold. Seiko is the only woman for me. What are you talking about? It's not nice to embarrass women. Come on. Please don't move. What are you doing? Don't move! Are you a pervert? Th row that away. That's a nasty hobby. You're too late now! I don't want to anymore. No! Calm down. No! Don't! I don't want to. No! Not there. Lower. Where? Lower. Here? You're so big. It's tight. Oh, my God. Oh, yes. Oh, God. Yes! What's your name? Toshihiko. Nice name. You're ready again? I've never met someone who can get back up that fast. I don't need this bitch anymore. It's just you now, Junko. Let's have sex. - Again? - Let's do it. We just did it. I'll die if I fuck that much. No! Please! Just one more time. I can't. I've hit my limit. Looks like you've been saving up for a long time. Toshi. You just keep going, huh? Are you worried about him? About who? Don't play dumb. The camera boy. I wonder where he is today. We don't need to vvorry about him. He must be in agony thinking about you. Do men only think about themselves when it comes to love? In most cases. What are you talking about? Even when a woman accepts him, he doesn't have confidence. So you accept the camera boy? I wasn't talking about him. You must have a sex target. Since when? I'm not ready to say it. Goodbye, virginity! It's not that easy. You just said you were ready! No, Ididrft! Start the countdown. Stop it. Chief, please look at this. What?! These are all the same woman. There aren't enough panty shots. Will you buy them? Shoot more variety. Something that really shows the panties. Something that sparks the reader's imagination. Then I'd buy your photos. - Here. - How much? -500 Yen. - Thanks. Seiko! Oh, it smells good. Don't! You pervert! Seiko. Though it was short-lived... ...forgive me for falling in love with another woman and forgetting about you. Excuse me. All right. I'm sorry, I didn't notice you. Please take my seat. No, it's okay. I insist. I'm a volunteer. Have a seat. No, I'm really okay. What happened to your leg? Oh, this? It's... A car accident? Oh, you poor thing. Oh, you're a volunteer, too. Maybe you saved a child who ran out in front of a car? That's wonderful. It warms my heart. I want to be a great volunteer like you. Please tell me the story and all the details of your accident. The story? I'm sure I can ease your pain. Yes, but... Please don't say no. Oh, you don't have to carry this. Are we going to talk here? Don't you have any side effects from the accident? Nothing. Do you have any physical impairment? I may or may not have. Physical impairment is very common. I'll check for you. What are you doing? I know what's going on. You were staring at me earlier. You must be impaired. I will cure you. I have to work hard as a volunteer. Um... Well? But I'm committed to somebody else. It's still at a 45 degree angle. I'm not doing enough. It's at 90 degrees now. I have to make it to 180 degrees to be a good volunteer. Seiko! Oh, I'm sorry. It's so big. I'm gonna come. Wait a second. Wait! Hold on a second. You have to wait. - It's amazing! - I can't hold it. Control it. Can I let it out now? Hold it. Just a minute. A little more. Not yet. - Not yet. - What's your name? Ikue. Ikue. I'm coming. Not yet. - Ikue. - Not yet. Ikue. Just a little longer. Excuse me. Ms. Terashima, what do you need? I brought my report. Bye. All right. Can I see it? Oh, Salinger. "My personal view of his influence on modern Japanese literature. " Salinger... I will read it later. By the wav- ...have you read his book, "Catcher in the Rye"? No. Vvhy? Professor, I'm scared of you. Isn't this why you came here? Let me go. Please. Is it your first time? Don't worry. I'll be gentle. No. Are you okay? What happened? Take out the cucumber. It stretches that much? I can't believe it. No. My husband is away on business in Hokkaido. I got it out. You aren't cured yet. Give me an injection. Is it really okay? Do it. OKZY- Here's your injection. No. No. I have a husband... ...in Hokkaido. Wow. You're amazing. It's so big. Seiko. I'm not cheating. This is an injection. Seiko! Wait. - We're not finished yet. - Let me go! - Seiko. Please wait! - Wait. This is a misunderstanding! Seiko, please wait. This is a misunderstanding! It's her fault. She was doing weird things with a cucumber. Please believe me. Today's been a big misunderstanding. Seiko, I didn't cheat on you. Don't touch me. Seiko, you've been on my mind for a long time. My name is Toshihiko. Please believe me. I wasn't cheating. Seiko, please believe me. Let go of me! Seiko, you have to understand. I want to talk to you. Seiko, please. Let go of me. Seiko. Seiko, please. Hear me out. Please don't look at me like some comic book character. Seiko! Ms. Seiko Terashima! I really need to pee. Cheer up. It's payday tomorrow. She compared me to a comic book character. Who did? Are you still hung up on that girl? I love her. Love? But she doesn't care about you, right? I still love her. Get over it. Even Seiko needs to pee. Henry Miller's sex is... ...a physical paradox in which love does not exist, right? What are you mad about? You tried to touch Seiko. I didn't do anything to her. She's just a kid. You had sex, didn't you? Please believe me. You're the only one I love. Otherwise I wouldn't have come all the way over here. Then prove it to me. IWill. I don't believe you. I need more proof. Professor. Professor. Well? Now do you believe me? Yes. Give me more proof. Professor. Well, I don't think you believe me yet. Don't tease me. I can't stand it. Professor, you are so good. Ifeel... dizzy. Hello. Professor. I love you. Hello. - Professor. - Naoko. Naoko. I love you. Stop! Stop it! Please stop! Stop! I love you. Professor. Junko. What happened? You look so feminine today. I have to go to work. I don't care if you love her. But right now I want you to love me. I want you to see only me. Please don't look at anyone else. Toshi, I don't care if it's not true. Tell me you love me. Just for now. Please. I'm in love with Seiko. But Junko, I like you, too. These are good. I think we can use this photo. Really? We are planning to make an issue featuring parks. Can you use an infrared camera to take some risqué photos? Yes. If you get good ones, I'll give you a contract. Anyway, get something good! Thank you very much! Do you have a Fuji IR-82 and Kodak Infrared? I need 'em. The west side of the park is for amateurs. No exciting subjects for photos. If you want to shoot the real thing, join the professionals oh the east side. But the Peeping Toms around there are territorial and can be violent. If you make a wrong move they won't hesitate to break your bones. What? Really? It'll be cold tonight. I'll give you a discount on this portable heater. I'm starting to feel hot. See? We don't need to go to a hotel. This is warm enough. I think I'm going to get hooked on park sex. It's so exciting because someone might see us. Let's save money by not going to a hotel. Good idea. I want to move out of the company dorm. This is great. Awesome! Hey, you. I've never seen you before. You're not a registered member. You're not allowed to touch so soon. You gotta earn it. You bastard! Asshole! Why do I need to register to be a Peeping Tom? My reasons aren't good enough, huh? I know all about men like you. So, let me go. You don't know anything. Iwas serious. If you were just playing with me please end it fast. I will end it fast. A with a fuck! Before we part, I'll teach you about men. No need to pay a lesson fee. Stop it! No! I got the shot... ...ofthe rape! This is proof. I'll sue you! You're a rapist! Guilty! Ten years in prison! Go to hell! Give me that camera, you bastard! Seiko, run! Hey, give it back to me! Damn it! Hey, do you think you can beat me? Shit! Yo, our customers left. It's your fault... ...for using flash. Son of a bitch! We can't have rumors that people are taking photos here. Customers will stop coming. Stupid kid! Don't upset me! He's just a kid! This is a misunderstanding. Shut up! No, it's not like that. Your knight is in trouble, Princess. How's that? Please stop! Don't ever think this is your own secret spot. This place is for everybody. Fool! Let's go. Damn it. Are you okay? How about you? Are you okay? To be able to die in the arms of the one I love... lam a happy man. Wait a second. Seiko... What happened to me? It's okay. Eat this. Here. I'm glad you saved me. Thank you so much. Oh no. I didn't do anything. You love photography. Yes, very much! Don't try to get up. Here. You are so kind, Seiko. You can take mine. What? My photo, I mean. Really? Seiko, move your leg. Stay still. Look at me. You're beautiful, Seiko. You look like Mona Lisa. Like an angel. Like Maria. Ithink so. Seiko, you are a goddess. Please show me your true self. Like that. Seiko, can you get in the shower? Can you take it off? Please don't look there. I'm too embarrassed. You have a dirty mind. What? You think so? Yes, I do. But that's human nature, and you're true to yourself. Actually, my mind is dirty, too. I believe you taught me that. Seiko. I like you. Are you ready? I did it. I did it with Seiko! THE END
