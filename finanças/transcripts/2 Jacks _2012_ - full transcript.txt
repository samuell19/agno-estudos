DIANA WAS NOW SO FAR FROM YOUNG, THAT SHE NO LONGER LOOKED UPON HERSELF AS SUCH. LIVING WITH DIANA WHERE HER DAUGHTER LILY, AND HER BROTHER BRAD, WHO HAVING LOST ANY MONEY HE EVER MADE ON MOVIES, FOUND REFUGE IN HIS OLD AGE AT DIANA'S. NOW WHY IS IT THAT NOWADAYS VIDEO GAMES ARE CONSIDERED ENTERTAINMENT? IT'S, IT'S A GAME. IT'S NOT ENTERTAINMENT. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU WATCH IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF ENTERTAINMENT JUST BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU WATCH. IF YOU WATCH IT AND IT'S ENTERTAINING THEN IT'S ENTERTAINMENT. FRUIT. WHAT'S, OH, OH, OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND NOTE. THAT FOR EGGS.
