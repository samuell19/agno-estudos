Translation by pandab and yuizaki_libra I'll Give It My All Tomorrow. God. Now what? God. Now what? Yes? Aren't you screwed? You're totally hopeless. Nothing's ther- ah! Oi! Shizuo! I said you're screwed! Shizuo! Chirping so loudly so early in the morning... Time to get up. One month after I quit my job. I have been searching for myself. Shizuo. Don't play Famicom first thing in the morning. This ain't Famicom. You dipshit! You two, don't quarrel first thing in the morning. Breakfast's ready. Leave them in the sink when you're done. 'Kay. Then I'm going to school. Sure. Shizuo, what are you trying to do? I want to live without regrets. That's all. I'm looking for my true self. How old do you think you are? Ozaki Yutaka said the same thing. Note: Ozaki Yutaka was a popular Japanese musician He said that at 15. At night, right? Note: reference to Ozaki Yutaka's single Jugo no yoru - The Night When I Was 15 Who cares! Think this through again. Quitting your job all of a sudden... I know. It's not like I want to play games and roam around all day. Of late, I've suddenly begun to feel insecure and anxious. Even you guys are relying on me to feed you. However, I finally found it today. I... ...will become a manga artist. Finally found it. My way of life. Can you draw? I may look like this, but I'm pretty skilled. Oi, pops. I know I've found myself, but there's no need to cry. You are... ...an idiot, aren't you? Do whatever you want. Listen, this might be good. With my novel middle-aged perspective and insight, I'll put my 40 years of life experience into my manga. First of all, we need a title. [Title] This is no good. I have... ...nothing to draw. You've really been doing it? When you say manga artists, you think 'all-nighters,' don't you? I didn't know. Is that so? But for now, the morning sun is brilliant. This is the 100th year since we've met. I'll have you die here. That's what I should say. Uncle! Uncle! Mutual strike, eh? Uncle! Mutual strike? Don't joke around. Uncle, you're alive! I'm in the pink of health too. We're both fine, huh? Seems that way. Farewell. Uncle~! Wow... This time your work is really deep. Isn't it? You've surprisingly taken a stab at historical manga. Yea? I've taken a stab. Surprisingly. Yes, you have. So in that case, with this... ...shall we aim for the Best Newcomer Award? Let me see. It's just that, I was thinking maybe it's too deep. Our magazine is for teenagers. Oh, that's right. Well, I knew that. But I just wanted to go all out. I understand. I believe, though, if it's you, Oguro-san, you can write something that touches the hearts of young people. Editor Murakami. Yes? Should I show... ...the real power of adults? Great idea! Show them that, and we will publish you right away. Alright! Yeah! So that was another no-go, huh? Manager, what are you doing? How many times have you made the same mistake? It's coffee, not coke float. Coffee. Yes. Is your heart in this, Manager? Yes, it is. I'll take care of this. You do the fries, Manager. Yes, sir! Manager! What's up with you? Making mistake after mistake? Happens to the best of us. That's no good. You're not a newbie. Getting scolded by that newbie, Bob. Yes. Anyway, Manager, want to go to a group date today? Group date? There'll be lots of young chicks. By the way, we need you to even the number of people. You know? That kind of thing... At this age, who still goes to group dates? Seriously, Manager? With your mature air and elegance, chicks will- ah! The real manager is here. Manager, thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work. Say, Oguro-kun. Yes? You were late again today? Sorry. My meeting with the publisher dragged on a little. Aren't you an adult? Yes, sir. Do your job properly. Yes, sir. To meeting new friends... Cheers!! By the way, today it's on Manager, so drink up, everyone! Is it all-you-can-drink-for-$10 here? There it is! Classic old man gag! Are you an idiot? It's an American joke! American! Where's Shizuo? He said he had a meeting with his editor. Such an obvious lie again. You're a manga artist? So you draw manga? Duh. Manga? That's hilarious. You should ask for his autograph now. No, thanks. By the way, what are you eating? Konowata. Note: Fermented sea cucumber entrails. Konowata. Note: Fermented sea cucumber entrails. What's that? It's so gross! Note: Fermented sea cucumber entrails. Gross! Manager, you sure are popular. Manager is pretty good, but wanna check out my group date magic? This guy's really awesome. Show us, show us! This guy's really awesome. Show us, show us! Alright, here goes! Alright, here goes! My thumb has been separated... Not! Told you he's good! What is that? Told you he's good! What is that? Excuse me. Erm... I'm Nakaba. Ah, that's right! The characters for 'middle' and 'garden.' Nakaba-san, what's your type when it comes to men? Me? First off, a man with no future plans whatsoever is no good. If he doesn't have savings, or if his salary is less than mine, then it's inconceivable. You're aiming to become a manga artist, aren't you? Well, yeah. I think you'd better get your act together. Wow. I want to go home. Looks like it's time to bring it on. Editor Murakami. 'Our magazine is for teenagers.' Who do you think I am? Wow, amazing. The real manager. 'Aren't you an adult?' 'Do your job properly.' Those youngsters. 'Ew! So gross~' And that insolent little girl. 'I think you'd better get your act together.' Is it okay if I give it my all? Wow, awesome. That's why... I'm gonna give it my all. What've you been doing until now? Good for you. Just thought I'd want you, my family, to know... ...my resolve. And? And what? You woke us up just to say that? Yup. Don't screw with me! I'm living on a higher plane... Sorry to disturb your studies. Come in. How's your studies going? Taking a break? Yeah. Even if you're giving it your all, you still need to take breaks. How's school going lately? It's lots of fun. I see. Still doing your part-time job? I am. Are you saving money? I am. That's good. Oh, right... Can I borrow some money? How much? $200. Okay. Here. My deepest gratitude. I'll pay you back on my pay day. You can pay me back whenever. Bye, then. Don't push yourself too hard, Suzuko. I know, thanks. You too, don't work too hard on your manga. Do you best. Yeah. I'll do my best. Weren't you giving it your all? I'm in between giving it my all. Say, Shizuo. Don't talk to me now. I'm in the middle of a crucial match. How many years do you plan to fool around? You see, human beings... ...will die someday. Life will come to an end, you know? It's rotten. You're still continuing to draw manga? What do you mean, 'continuing?' Well, I was just thinking it's about time you got sick of it. Mister Miyata. I'm giving it my all. If you're giving it your all, is it okay to be drinking here? Occasionally you have to take a breather. You take a break, so that the ideas come to you. After this, I'll be going home to pull an all-nighter. This late? What kind of all-nighter starts from 6PM? An all-nighter should start... ...after 2AM. I don't get that kind of reasoning. Oi, Kuni-san, give me another. But your dad's really been easy on you, eh? Mister Miyata. If you can't earn your own family's approval, how can you earn your readers'? Go look for a job right now, idiot! That makes sense. Right? Anyhow, at your age, isn't it tiresome to work part-time with a bunch of youngsters? Mister Miyata. You can't pretend to be an adult around 40. You have to keep it fresh. I don't get it. Alright. That was slow! Thank you very much. Welcome. Thank you very much. Welcome. You've been here for a month, but you're practicing your greetings now? That's funny. I was told to practice. By whom? The real manager's not here today. Bob. Bob's really got it in for you, eh? By the way, Manager, Ichinosawa, the guy who starts today, he keeps saying he feels sluggish and isn't doing his job. I guess I could tell him off, but it's better if Manager gives him a good scolding. But I'm not the real manager. Please show him... ...the toughness of the adult world. The toughness of the adult world? I see. Only I can teach him the toughness of the adult world. Alright, I'll go. I'm counting on you. Where is that guy? Manager's Office. Don't you have a cold? Well, I'm not sure. I just feel sluggish. It's a cold. Definitely. You look really pale. Why don't you call it a day? Is it okay? Sorry for the trouble. People say, 'a cold is the source of ten thousand illnesses.' That's why... Excuse me! Understood, Ichinosawa-kun? You can't do that! Right, what is it? We're in trouble! Tanaka-san's arguing with a customer! They even said something about taking it outside. I got it. I'll be there right away. Leave it to me. You can't do that! That's why I'm telling you those crunchy fries are delicious. And I'm telling you these are not crunchy. The fries don't taste good if they are soggy. That's enough, go back inside. They are so unreasonable. They said the fries were too hard. their mouths got hurt, and now they want compensation! I'm so pissed off! That's enough. Just leave it to the experience and judgment of an adult. Wait a minute. That's enough. But, Manager... That's enough. Did our part-timer do something wrong? Are you the manager? Yea. Well... Here, eat these fries. They're too hard. Manager, you don't like pain, do you? Hurry up and hand over the money so we can resolve this happily. Yes... This pain in the teeth is our store's signature. - What did you say? - Are you making fun of us, asshole?! Eh? What's the matter? Since you said I could take the day off, I'm going home. Alright. Thank you for your hard work. What're you looking at? Got a problem? What's the matter? You want a beating too? Thank you for your hard work. Get well soon. Ah, wait a minute! Good swing! You can do it! You can do it! You did it! Good, good. Oh, oh, oh, I got this. He fell. Are you alright, Coach? Oh, Coach, you got hurt. This much is nothing. Eh, Coach is crying. I'm not crying! Gather round! The real coach is here. See you! Alright... go, go. Shizuo, are you okay? Oh, you're late, Miyata! My stomach's growling, you know? 'Stomach's growling...' Did we arrange to have dinner together? We didn't, but... it's unthinkable to have dinner without you, right? Ichinosawa-kun, our sponsor is here! Time to eat! Let's eat! Gross... You... Don't hold back. Eat all you want! Ichinosawa-kun, you're 26, huh? That's nice, to be young. That stinks. You reek of old man stink! You don't tell youngsters that they're young. You'll be unpopular. Now that I'm at this age, even if I'm unpopular, what can I do? That's stupid. Mister Miyata, that's stupid. Why did you have to say it twice? Isn't it even more important to be popular from now on? You're divorced and living alone, so for the sake of your new life, the thing you need is... to be popular, isn't it? Oh, is that so? What do you think, Shuichi? Ah, I went ahead and dropped the honorifics. So, Shuichi... How do Mister Miyata and I compare? A salary man living in despair... ...and a manga artist who's taking his life from here on out, eh? Who's better? Isn't it fine? Which one, eh? Aren't both of them fine? Well... Since Mister Miyata is treating you, you can't make him look bad for being a salary man, huh? No, it's cool to be a salary man. Seriously. I guess I'll just go ahead and say, 'thank you.' If I could, I'd like to become a salary man. It's not too late to become one, you know. I'm bad at waking up in the morning. Mornings... In the morning, you just want to play games, right. Mister Miyata, you should quit your job and try playing games in the morning too. Oh, but wait. You can't quit anymore. Thanks for the treat. Please invite me again next time. Thank you very much for the treat. Do your best, Ichinosawa-kun. You too, okay. Is it really cool? Oi! Suzuko! We're home! Oh no! I'm so sorry. What should I do with him? Please bring him here. I'm so sorry. Why did you puke on my futon?! Okay, Shuichi... Yaah! You did it again! Shuichi... Stay over in my room. Nah... The last train has left, hasn't it? If it's alright with you, please... 'Kay. He's seriously been drawing manga... Work hard. That really stinks. Sorry to keep you waiting. ＜Are Ya Talkin' To Me? - Oguro Shizuo＞ Oguro-san. May I be blunt with you? Go ahead. Last last time it was a horror manga. Last time it was a sports car manga. And this time, it's a delinquent manga. Oguro-san... Could it be possible that... ...there is no genre that you cannot draw? Ah, Editor Murakami... Actually, I've begun to suspect the same thing. You see, because... I never even imagined that you would come in with a delinquent manga. Recently, I've been thinking a lot... In other words... If you can ascertain the genre that you want to work with... I'll be invincible. That's right. So, let's work hard and aim for your debut. Let's do that. I'll just leave this manuscript here... Nope, it's okay. Please take it back. Got it. Do your best. I'll take my leave. Take care. What are you going to do? About? From here on. Is it alright to continue trying to be a manga artist like this? Can you succeed? Doesn't success seem to move further the more you draw? Shut the hell up! How about you come up with some interesting ideas then? Don't depend on me. Hey, calm down and think carefully. Haiya! Seh! You want to mess with God, you bastard? Bring it on! I'm sorry! I'm sorry too! ＜Tie Game＞ What's this? The great writer has been watching the TV the whole time? He said he's in a slump. Slump? A slump is something that... ...only people who have exerted themselves at least once can have, right? "The best-selling manga artist, Komuro Takeshi." Best selling manga artist, eh. He's the same age as you. Your works have become big hits, one after another, ＜Just for the viewers, we get personal with the manga artist that everyone's talking about, Komuro Takeshi!＞ and have even been made into a number of drama series and movies. ＜Just for the viewers, we get personal with the manga artist that everyone's talking about, Komuro Takeshi!＞ What does the future hold for you? ＜Just for the viewers, we get personal with the manga artist that everyone's talking about, Komuro Takeshi!＞ These past twenty years, I've been heedlessly drawing manga, but... to be honest, I've recently started thinking about retiring. You want to retire? I've realized that after forty, your physical stamina begins to drop, and the concentration you need to produce good works... ...begins to drop as well. I've spent all of my time drawing manga... ...that I haven't paid my family enough attention. I was thinking I want to leisurely pass my days from now on. But many people around me have told me not to stop, and even my own kids have told me not to put my pen down. So recently, I've begun to reconsider... Please reconsider your decision to retire! For our sake and for all your other fans! I'm going to sleep. What about dinner? How is it, Masao? Yummy? Yes. How about we go to the zoo next time? Yes. And after that, I'll take you out for dinner. What do you want to eat? Bread. Bread? Is bread alright? Alright, then Dad will look for a place with delicious bread. Ah, mother. See you next month. What's the matter? I was just thinking, I wish I was a bird. Is that so. I just saw my kid. Yoshio? Masao. Was he in grade three? Grade one. Did he get bigger? Yea. I don't want to say this, but... I'm jealous of you. Huh? What's the matter, Miyata? Are you alright? I don't want your concern. Going home? I've been promoted to sub-leader in my part-time job. My hourly wage is up 30 cents. Suzuko... If I make it as a manga artist... How will you feel? I don't know. I don't know, so you should try it and see. 'I don't know, so you should try it and see.' 'I don't know, so you should try it and see.' ＜Until Today and From Tomorrow - Oguro Shizuo＞ Oguro-kun... Are you serious? Yes! I'm serious. ＜Resignation Letter＞ Yes! I'm serious. ＜Resignation Letter＞ Is there any way you'll reconsider? ＜Resignation Letter＞ ＜Resignation Letter＞ Sorry, but I've already made my decision. ＜Resignation Letter＞ Sorry, but I've already made my decision. Is that so... I understand. This company is too narrow for you. It's too bad, but thank you for the work you've done! I'm in your debt! And with this, my manga journey has begun. Oguro Shizuo. 41 years old. Summer. You've found what you wanted to draw, eh. Yes. Autobiography. Can I be blunt with you? Go ahead. ＜Rejected＞ Coach, you should have picked the ball. ＜Rejected＞ Coach, you should have picked the ball. Welcome. How old are you again, Ichinosawa-kun? 26. Is there something you want to do? Not particularly. If that's the case, become a full-timer! If you're a full-timer, it's your ability that counts. There are even guys who become manager at 25. Well, it's not an easy job though. By the way, it seems next year they'll be entrusting the store to me. I wish they'd hurry up and make me manager. You don't talk much, do you. Why the blonde hair? Your policy? What are you up to? In the middle of finding myself. I've started working for a cabaret club. You hope if you do well, you can hook up with cabaret girls, eh? Nope. Oh Shuichi. The real world isn't so generous. Such a self-indulgent job... ...doesn't exist, you know. Goodbye. Take care. Don't play games during mealtime. It's a crucial match. Shizuo. Come with me for a bit. No! I said this is a crucial match. That's enough! Come here! Shizuo. Right now, you... are in a crisis! Recently, you've not even been drawing manga. I'm searching for the story I want to draw. Listen, all humans... ...have things they are suited and not suited to do. Manga doesn't suit you. In other words, you're in a crisis! Isn't it said, 'Every crisis is an opportunity?' But only for you, 'Every crisis is a crisis!' Only for me? Shizuo. Why do you think Suzuko hasn't gone astray? She has given up on you as a father. That's not true. Here's my suggestion. Go ahead and draw manga. Draw till your arm breaks. However! Do it as a hobby! Get a real job. If my arm breaks, I won't be able to work. Listen. Pops, you're wrong! You bastard! Die, bastard. Die! Die! It's been a while! Kichi, why haven't you been coming? I've been busy with work, but... Happy Birthday! Waah, I'm so happy! Sunflowers are my favorite flower. How did you know? Eh? Er... Somehow. Eh~? How? Somehow I just knew! As expected of Kichi-san! Nah... Alright, everyone! Quickly clean up so we can all go home! Thanks for your hard work. Thanks for your hard work. Hey, Ken-chan, get rid of this for me. Why? Isn't it a present? I don't need things like flowers. What's more, they're sunflowers... It'd be better if that old man just dropped dead. Obviously you can't discard it around here, right? I don't need it either... Oh! The old dude who just started here! - Come come come come. - Yes? - Come come come come. - Come come come come. Come come. Come. Come come come come come. Here, free-of-charge. Thank you very much. What? Ken-chan is so kind. Don't throw it away, okay. I'm happy. Then look more happy! I'm happy! Your body language has to match! I'm happy! More more more more. I'm happy! More more. I'm happy! I'm happy! More more I'm happy! More more I'm happy! More! More! I'm happy! I'm happy! More more I'm happy! More I'm happy! What's the matter? Can I stay over? I had an argument with my dad. Can I stay here for a while? For a while? We'll have a good time sleeping together. No. Hap... It's not what you think. Right, then, excuse me. I said no. Why not? It doesn't matter why not. Weren't we childhood friends? What's that got to do with anything? Hey... Let's sleep together. I'm calling the police. Seriously. Ichinosawa-san, have you been working at this job long? Two weeks. Is that so. You've learnt the ropes really quickly! My memory is really bad and I only cause problems... I'm so sorry. When you get older, these things... You don't have to use polite speech with me. I'm just a part-timer. That doesn't matter. Please look after me from now on! But... Well then, my house is over there. Erm. Yes? Is it okay? That scrawny mustache... That scrawny moustache's attitude. It's fine, it's fine. If I'm fired from this place, I'll be in trouble. My previous company went bankrupt, and next year my daughter goes to college. I'm a newcomer. This much is only expected. Well then, thank you for your hard work! Thank you for your hard work. So boring... I'm here. Thanks for the beer. I envy you, Shizuo-san. What is? You have something you want to do. Don't you have something you want to do, Shuichi? Well, I've always been like that. I never follow through with anything I do. And I'm sure I'll be the same in the future. You're thinking too much. If you're thinking about the future, you won't live properly in the present. You don't think about your future? Of course. I'm too scared to think about it. Hold on... For me... It's already here, isn't it? My future. Aren't I living in my future now? It'd be nice if you debuted as a manga artist. Wouldn't it. Maybe I should quit drinking, or I won't live long. It's not something to laugh about! Sorry to disturb you. Oh, it's Suzuko. Are you in the middle of your work? Nah, I was just about to take a break. Don't push yourself too hard. Grandpa. Hello! Oh, Shizuda. You look well. I heard Hollywood is going to make a movie out of your new work this time. I heard about it on TV. There's some talk about that. How's it going, Suzuko? Are you getting along well with your husband? Well, yea. Since you came all the way here, how about going to eat at Chef Matsuo's? Dear! Shizuo's new work became a big hit again! Dad, yesterday we went to Ginza Aster, but how about going to Chef Matsuo's tonight? See! Your son is so remarkable, dear! There he goes again.. saying the same thing everyday. Although you were the one who was against it the most. But he looks so happy. Yes, that's good. Big Grandpa! Shizuda! You've grown so big! Over here, grandpa. Over here? Over here, over here. Shizuda... It's not the time to indulge in grand delusions, you know. You finally found what you wanted to draw... ...but in the end you got rejected again. It's just as Dad said, manga is... Don't say anymore. What are you going to do? You recklessly quit your job, and now you're in these circumstances... It wasn't reckless! You're already at this age, shouldn't you be thinking a bit more before you act? He should, shouldn't he? It's luck, isn't it? Luck. You're just unlucky. Luck? Please listen to this song. "My Generation." 1 2 3 4 It hasn't arrived yet... My generation. Brimming with problems... This world we live in. Unable to realize my full potential Everyday in the middle of the night I lie awake Tonight I'll be drinking sadly again. Is being unemployed... such a bad thing? We've all just been born into the wrong generation. Don't sing embarrassing songs. Oh? The cogwheel of society is squeaking. Don't sing embarrassing songs. Oh? The cogwheel of society is squeaking. Shut up! Scum of society. Don't look down on those who've renounced society! All of you are so lame! Manga artist? What a loser. Salary man? Why don't you just burn your stupid necktie? What's this about 'renounce society?' You have to build your own generation! All of you just don't have any fighting spirit! Trash! Well, I think we should really make a decision on this. Should he draw manga seriously? Or as a hobby? Tell me. What do you guys think? I think it may be better to pursue a cooler dream. Well... It's fine as a hobby. Do it as a hobby. That's right. Find another job and draw as a hobby. You've been rejected so many times, anyway. What pops said was right. I... want to do it. What? I want to debut. I'll do my best. I'll do my best. Shizuo-san, time for your part-time job. Your job. Just what kind of dream is he having? Try to make it within three minutes of the customer's order. If you're free, find something... Don't touch the potatoes I dug up. Note: The Japanese for this phrase is supposed to sound like "What time is it now?" in English. Don't touch the potatoes I dug up. Note: The Japanese for this phrase is supposed to sound like "What time is it now?" in English. I didn't touch them! Note: The Japanese for this phrase is supposed to sound like "What time is it now?" in English. Don't touch the potatoes I dug up. Note: The Japanese for this phrase is supposed to sound like "What time is it now?" in English. Er... Find something to do on your own. Okay? Yes, sir. Hey, Manager, I'm trying to teach the newbies. You're a veteran so could you stop talking rubbish? You're a sub-leader after all. For the time being. You're too green, Tanaka. What's that? Mister Tanaka... In a regime of terror, real trust can't be built. Just watch this... The charisma of one who made it to Chief Clerk in his salary man days. Hey, want to drink some juice? Eh? It's your first day, so... Go ahead and drink what you like. Right then, I'll drink first. The real manager! Thank you for your hard work. What are you doing? Drinking for free? No, er... I'll slap you later. Slap? Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. ＜Debut＞ Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. ＜Debut＞ Graduate from my part-time job. Graduate from my part-time job. ＜Debut＞ ＜Debut＞ How many years have you been doing this job? Asshole! I'm so sorry. Do it properly! Thanks for your hard work. God damn it! Why do I have to be the one to get screwed? I don't understand! Old man. Come here for a bit. Get over here. Ah, old man, you've got nose shit coming out! Ah, it's a mole! Ken-chan, that's harsh. Old man, the toilet is real filthy today. Go scrub it after this, okay. Yes sir. Also, you made a mistake with a drink order today, right? Yes sir. I'm sorry. Didn't I tell you from the start... to memorize all the names of the drinks perfectly! Yes sir. Saying that you don't drink alcohol isn't an excuse. Yes sir. I'm so sorry. I'm not getting through to you... How about you kowtow? Yes sir. I'm so sorry. Not bad... the kowtow of an old man. It's got flavor. Right, today you'll stay back alone. Clean the toilets and close up. Yes sir. Don't think it's that easy to make money. Yes sir. Alright everyone, leave it to the old man and go home. Lucky- Thanks for your hard work. Thanks for your hard work. Erm... Ichinosawa-san. I'll help. It's alright. I'm used to this. I'll be done soon. I see. Thank you very much. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work. Ah, I'm starving. Let's eat beef bowls before heading back. Sounds good. Eh? What's the matter, Ichinosawa-kun? Your face. What are you doing? You bastard! What am I doing? What am I doing? Damn it, did my manuscript get wet? ＜I'm Still Alright.＞ Yosh. ＜I'm Still Alright.＞ ＜I'm Still Alright.＞ Is it finally time for my debut? Thank you for your patronage. This is Travelers' Homes Inc. Yes. Yes. Section Chief Miyata, is that right? Yes, certainly. Please hold on. Section Chief Miyata. Yes? There is an Oguro Shizuo on line two for you. Tell him I'll call him back later. It seems pretty urgent, though... Eh? Here. What do you think is wrong with it? Even if you ask me, I don't know much about manga. Isn't it just that you have no talent? Kuni-san. There's a limit to what's okay to joke about. More importantly, Ichinosawa-kun, how's your part-time job? Ah! This guy got fired for getting into a fight again! He's such a useless guy, jeez. I see. How about you look for a full-time job? It's impossible for someone like me. No, no. That's not true. That's right. If there's nothing you want to do, you might as well get a job. Although you'll age really quickly just like him. If you want, I'll get you a recommendation. No thanks, it's fine. You should treasure opportunities like this, young'un. Ah, I got it! What's up all of a sudden? It's luck. It's just that I have no luck, right? How would I know. It's not like you rose to section chief just on your ability alone. And look at Kuni-san. Although his cooking is so bad, thanks to luck and chance, he's got a restaurant. That's right, it's luck. Luck! Jeez... That guy's always like that. Miyata-san. Is it interesting being a salary man? Interesting? Hmm... Sorry. It's luck, isn't it. As I suspected. Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' Er, it's just as you said. Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' What should I do, master? Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' How about you change your name and see? Note: The sound he makes is a (possibly fake) speech tick that sounds like the Japanese word for 'luck.' How about you change your name and see? Name? Er, you're a manga artist, right? If that's the case... don't you have a pen name? Yes, I do! Then, as for the pen name that will bring you luck, I'll take a little look into this crystal ball. Please! Right. Ah, I've got it I've got it now, I've got it now. I've... I've got it completely. I've got it here, can you see it? Can you see it, sir? Yea. Er, don't point with your finger, don't point! It's gone! Ah, it's back, it's back, it's back. I can see it. I can see it. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ I've got it. ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ ＜Personal Real Estate＞ ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ I've got it. ＜Personal Real Estate＞ ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ ＜Personal Real Estate＞ ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ I've got it. ＜Personal Real Estate＞ ＜Nakamura Pharmacy＞ I've got it. ＜Personal Real Estate＞ ＜Personal Real Estate＞ Yes, I've got it. ＜Personal Real Estate＞ Yes, I've got it. ＜Nakamura Person＞ I see you got a pen name. ＜Nakamura Person＞ ＜Nakamura Person＞ Nakamura Person. You've thought hard about this. Nope, I just don't want to get old, Editor Murakami. But somehow, I'd forgotten how to attack. Before I knew it, I was on the defensive. WIth that kind of attitude, you can't produce works, right? The defensive Oguro Shizuo has been reborn and transformed into... ...the aggressive Nakamura Person. So I see, so I see. By the way, Oguro-san... Ah, it's Nakamura. I'm so sorry. Nakamura... Person-san This... was interesting. Ah, is that so. Well, it's my first piece so... I'll do better next time. No... If you ask me, Nakamura Person has not completely penetrated here yet... No, no. Really, this was interesting. Eh? It's not rejected. Eh? What do you mean? This piece can make it. Are you for real? With this, let's apply for the newcomer award. Yes! ＜One Month Later＞ Thank you very much. How is it, Masao? The bread here's good, right? Yes. Just eat what you like, okay? Yes. Right. Masao, Over here. - Nakamura Person, 42 years old> This guy, Nakamura Person... - Nakamura Person, 42 years old> - Nakamura Person, 42 years old> ...is Dad's friend. He changed his name, but... ...he's someone you've met before, you know. Maybe you'll remember. You know, his hair is always messy, has a beard... Shizuo? Use the '-san' honorific, okay? This uncle, he's drawing manga now. Isn't that amazing? Yes. Speaking of which, you got first place in a drawing contest, right? That's amazing! You're good at drawing, eh. What did you draw? Mum. I see. That's really good. Yes. There's still some time before Mom comes, so eat more. Yes. It's been 42 years. I know I've not always been the best son. I've really made you worried. My deepest apologies. Pops... It's been so long... I've kept you waiting. Shizuo. You've done well. You're great! Pops! You've worked so hard. Congratulations! So now, you can forget about manga completely. Ah? Isn't it fine! You managed to get published in a magazine once. That's enough. Keep this as a great memory for life... ...and go find a secure job again. Come on, Person-san. You're already 42 years old. From here on... I'm home. Hold it! I'm not done talking! Quick. Page 315. Nakamura Person. Nakamura Person? Me. Honorable mention! That's great! Congratulations. It's no big deal. Seems like your Dad just keeps steadily leveling up. Looks like the day you debut is pretty close. Oi, oi. Don't underestimate what it takes to debut. An honorable mention means... ...that I've still got a little way more to go. But you know, Suzuko. Now, your Dad... ...has the spirit. Indeed. Indeed. Try and imagine. What? The remainder of your life span. Have you thought about how for some reason... ...people usually get married around 30, have kids, build a home, ...face old age and die around 80? Kid, how old are you now? 25 years old. 300 year lifespan! When you think about humans having 80 years of life, you get depressed. But if you think you've got 300 years, Life will be the color of roses! ＜Life: 300 years. 50 years old: Finish formal education. 80 years old: Coming-of-age ceremony. 150 years old: Get a job.＞ Kid, in your case, you've 275 years left. ＜Life: 300 years. 50 years old: Finish formal education. 80 years old: Coming-of-age ceremony. 150 years old: Get a job.＞ ＜Life: 300 years. 50 years old: Finish formal education. 80 years old: Coming-of-age ceremony. 150 years old: Get a job.＞ There's no need to be anxious. ＜Life: 300 years. 50 years old: Finish formal education. 80 years old: Coming-of-age ceremony. 150 years old: Get a job.＞ There's no need to be anxious. I see! Alright! Together! This is... I thought of this out of the blue. Is my life really going to end at 80? In reality, medical science is advancing rapidly today. Why 300 years? If it was 1000 years, you'd have a lot left over, right? I see... Nakamura-san... This manga... ...is a masterpiece! 'It's so wonderful. I'm so touched.' 'Let's leave it as it is. This manga will win big prizes!' 'It's finally your debut!' Over here! Here! Here! Over here! Coach! So that means, from today I'll be doing the finishing touches. That's great. I didn't think you'd succeed. If you make a wish it might come true, eh? Well, it's also because of my ability. Thanks for your hard work. What the? What's this, Shuichi? How was it? The interview? What can I say... They had all sorts of prerequisites. I see. Looking for a job... Isn't that good? It suits an ordinary person like you... Getting a job. Stop saying that sort of thing. I know you're really spirited now, but... Ichinosawa-kun has decided to take his life seriously. No, it's not like that. I can't live like Shizuo-san. That's true. Those with talent have it easy. Anyway, cheers to Ichinosawa-kun's hard work. Thanks. Cheers Cheers. Manager. Good morning. Good morning. What's the matter? You seem even more distracted than usual. Well... Is a 42 year old man who smells of french fries like this... ...really okay? You've thought of something pointless, eh. I didn't get much sleep. You're gonna get rejected anyway. Might as well get some sleep. What's with that way of talking? You've got crazy eye bags. Is it psychological stress? Drawing a manga is hard work! What? Do you mean, you're getting published? I've been waiting for this. Oh no. If you quit, what's gonna become of the store, Manager? It's alright. There's still the real manager. That's true, but it's gonna get lonely around here. I see. I can give you my first autograph. Sorry to make you wait. No, it's fine. The meeting with our clients dragged on. I've to go pick up Masao and... ...there's not much time left, so I'll get straight to the point. I've decided to remarry. Seriously? Congratulations. That's why, I'd like you to forget about him. What? Masao. I'd like you to forget about him. It's not natural to have two fathers, right? What did Masao say? Masao also loves him, and has already recognized him as his father. So it's now fine if you stop paying alimony. I want us to live as a family of three. Are you angry? No. It's fine to be angry. I selfishly decided all of this on my own. No, I... ...don't have the right to be angry. You're really... ...an excellent human being, you know. Even when I make a mistake with the laundry, and put them into the wrong drawers, You'll just quietly put them in the right ones. If Masao scribbles on the wall, you forgive it with a smile, and secretly clean it off in the middle of the night. You're a really kind person. But you're not a husband or a father. You're just a kind person who happens to live with us. What's wrong with that! Eh? What's so bad about that? You're kind to me and Masao because you have no interest in us, right?! Just being kind doesn't make you a father! Sorry. I'm sorry too. I'm selfish, aren't I. Leaving a husband as kind as you. But... I think Masao feels the same way. Please understand. I understand. Bye. What's the matter, Suzuko? Recently you've been coming home late. There's been lots of work at my part-time job at the bookstore lately. It's not good to come back so late. It's dangerous. Okay, I got it. I'm home. ＜Classified Ads: Japan Jobs＞ Hello? That hurt! I messed up. Sorry for calling you out all of a sudden. It's fine, I'm really free. How's it going? Your job search. It's no good. Sorry I'm not able to meet your expectations. No, it's fine. Miyata-san, you're too kind. What? To me, and to Shizuo-san. My wife said the same thing when we broke up. 'You're too kind.' 'When I'm with you, I start to hate myself.' Until now, I still really regret it. Why did I accept the divorce. What did I do wrong? I just... ...wanted to build a good home. Nope. I didn't call you out to give this depressing speech. Ichinosawa-kun. Since I've been pushing you to get a job, it might seem strange for me to say this. I have a request. What is it? Actually... Sorry for calling you out all of a sudden. No, no. Even artists need to take a break once in a while. I'll drink from the bottle. Rare for it to actually be chilled. So, Miyata-kun, there's something you want to say? Oh... I was just about to tell Ichinosawa-kun. I... ...want to become a baker. What? What about your job? I'll quit. Wow... Will you help me with the shop? Yes. You're an idiot, aren't you. Maybe. You've done it now. Have I? That's great. I think it's great. I'm so happy to hear you say that. Shizuo, help me think of a store name. Leave it to me! I'll show you my creativity. I'm counting on you. It's about time to wake up. That's right... I finished everything before going to sleep. It's the morning of my debut. What's up, Manager? You don't have a shift today, right. Well, that's true... What's up? Nothing much. What's that envelope? Ah, you saw it? It's the work I'm going to publish. I'm bringing it over to the publisher now. Seriously? I thought you were just all-talk, but... ...you actually did it! Miyata... quit his job. Looks like you were right to leave him. Over 40 but unemployed. But, that guy... now he's free like me and can finally spread his wings. If he had a wife and kid, he wouldn't be able to do that, right? What are you saying? Miyata... is going to become great. But not as great as me, of course! Let's go. Ma-kun, let's go. I don't want to. I don't want Papa to become an adult like that. I'm so sorry, Oguro-san. Murakami left the company yesterday. Er, he said to give this to you if you came. 'Thank you very much, Oguro-san.' 'I have always admired how freely you lived your life.' 'You've given me the courage to do what I really want to do.' 'Please do your best so that you definitely get published.' Wha... what's this? If that's the case... shall I get you a new editor? A new editor? Hold on, I'll fix it up. Oguro-san, she will be your editor. Pleased to meet you. I'm Unami. Pleased to meet you. I read your latest work... 300 Year Lifespan. I've brought the finished manuscript today. What was that? 'What was that?' It's rejected. What? It's rejected. ＜Dirt-Cheap Massage Parlor＞ Coming in the middle of a weekday... Are you self-employed? What is it? What do you do? Whatever's fine. You're so secretive... must be mass media. Those in the mass media always want to keep it low, right? That's not what it is. Right then, please lie down. That is to say... Please come again! Yep, I'll come again! How are you. How. Are. You. You know each other? Since when? Since when... ...did I become so deplorable? Are you alright? I told you it was impossible. Even if it's just once, didn't you have a nice dream? Yea. It's not bad to die at your most miserable moment. Yea. It's because you only thought about yourself... ...that things ended up like this. Yea. I told you so, didn't I. How many years has it been since Suzuko called you father? It's true. If you get reincarnated, spend your whole life working properly as a salary man, okay?. Yes. What did this place used to be? This used to be a fruit store... ...but business was so terrible that the shop closed down. Can you guess why? I don't know. This store... ...was meant to be a bakery. What do you mean? Take for example the people who live around here. They're all families who love bread and little girls who love bread... At any rate, it's a bread-loving neighborhood. Speaking of which, for some reason, up to now this neighborhood has not had... a bakery. So, it's a good location? I can see it. Crowds gathering to buy your bread... Person, after person, after person. What's that? I think I smell the fragrance of bread being baked! Do you smell it too? Nope, I don't. I can already see yeast rising rapidly, over here. Is that so? Yes, it is. What are you guys doing here? Masao insisted on coming. Eh? If I'm not around, Papa will end up just like Shizuo. What's that? Since you quit your job, he's been crying everyday, saying you'll end up like Shizuo. That's... I... will be with Papa! I'll help you out so that you don't become like Shizuo! Masao... But, what about you? I don't want to be separated from Masao. Then... I don't know how to bake but... I don't know how to bake either, but... I'll do my best. Aren't you fortunate? Your head is unbelievably harder than an ordinary person. Thank you very much. Note: In Japanese too, being hardheaded means being stubborn. It's so fortunate that your head is so hard. You gave me a shock today. You go there often? How could I? I see. You can't go often... to a place like that. It is a wonderful place, though. What did you say? Since when...? Eh? That place. Just before you became Nakamura Person. I see. Why? I want to study abroad. That's nice. Studying abroad. Where? I lied. I wanted Dad to continue drawing manga. If something happens and we don't have money, we'll be in trouble. Suzuko... I wanted to read Dad's manga. For some reason. It's been a while... ...since you called me Dad. Is that so? So... For the first time in a while, is it okay if I act like a father and make a request? Go ahead. I'm telling you... ...to quit that job. Yes. As a father, I'm also saying... I'm going to give it my all. Oguro Shizuo! Is going to give it his all! Is that okay?! Yes it is! Translation by pandab and yuizaki_libra@livejournal This... manga... Go out with me! Till I get published! Go all out with me! I'm... very presumptuous, you know. I want to do it. ＜Bakery Miyata＞ ＜I'm Starting From Now - Nakamura Person＞
