Yo, yo... You guys are freaking out a little too much here... We're Yakuza.. We ain't letting you get away! Someone..Someone save us!! That's enough! Who are you? I'm... St. Agnes Academy Class 3-A Leader.. Sakaki Makio. St. Agnes? Leader of Class 3-A? You rotten guys think you can beat me?! Makky! Sakaki-kun! Umemura-san! Thank you. Hero... The End. Main Character: Me. Heroine: Umemura-san. The Friend: Sakura-something. The Homeroom Teacher: Iron-Face. Leader of the Bad Guys: Kazu. Everyone from Class 3-A.. Everyone from the Kantou Sharp Fang. Idea by: Me. - Master.. Written by: Me. - Master.. Directed by: Me. - Master.. What? I'm very sorry about interrupting your dream, but.. It's almost time for studies. There's a protractor on your face. It was a great dream. We'll be continuing elementary mathematics today. I got it. I'm turning this in also. Oh, your journal with Yuriko-sensei. Writing a journal for 3 months is a pain, but.. But I'm kinda sad it finishes today. - Aniki, news. - What? Starting tomorrow, the winter outfit is back. Oh the winter uniform. - It's already that season? - Yes. Yo, I'm the Kantou Sharp Fang's Young Master, Sakaki Makio. 27 years old. Scorpio. And yet in the morning, I become... St. Agnes Academy 3-A class leader.. Sakaki-Makio, and become 17 years old. How is it? Do I look like a high school student? Yes, you look like a model student. The white socks define it. The white socks define it! I thought school and studying was a bunch of crap... Now I'm being optimistic. - Mikio? - Yes? How is university? I'm finally getting used to it. Economics from Japan's perspective is quite interesting. Historically, it's one of the first fully developed societies.. But I'm not quite sure that experience allows us any power of persuasion. Complicated isn't it. Makio, how about you? Huh? I made a sssssuggestion box. Sssssuggestion box? I learned it in Japanese history class. As class president, I'll use this to bring the class together a bit more. Not bad. Yeah. How's the gang been lately? You don't have to worry about that. More milk? Nah, I'm good. Alright... I'm off to school. Have a good day. Be careful. If he finds out I was the one who acquired the Shichiriya Gang... What would he say? Mikio... Huh? What the hell are you thinking? Why involve yourself with the gang's work all of a sudden? No reason. It looked interesting is all.. Oh, a suggestion box. You look like you're enjoying yourself lately. I'm basically a greedy carnivore. I always get whatever I want. From now on.. I won't hold back and enjoy school. Well, that's how it is... N-n-n-ext time.. About l-l-l-ove... Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. If Jun is still here, then it must mean we're not late. What's that supposed to mean? And by the way, you're late way too often. My bad. "To Sakaki-kun: I'll make lunch sometime. Would you like to go somewhere sometime?" Sis! Azusa, what's wrong? You took my pencil case by accident. Oh! Anikinder! Sorry, I made a mistake. Jeez.. Sorry. Azusa, you've gotten big. Jun-kun, good morning. Morning. Who's the old man? Old man? He's not an old man, he's my friend. Oh right! You're Sakaki! Huh? Sa-sa..? Enough, hurry up and get to school! Ok, see you later! Have a good day. Sorry, sometimes I talk about you at home. Really? Shall we? We'll all be late. Ok. Alright... Today is the day, I.. Ask Umemura-san out on a date! Ask Umemura-san out on a date!! Ask Umemura-san out date myself!!!! Winner! That was great, Makky! Really? As expected of my underling. You might be 2nd strongest guy here, next to me. No way.. Hoshino-kun is good at judging people. Not bad. You used to practice Judo? Yea, ever since I saw Yamashita win the Gold Medal at the Olympics at Los Angeles. I see.. the Olympics at Los Angeles.. But you weren't even born yet. Huh?! Are you really 17? Every now and then, you seem like an adult.. That spot between your eyebrows. And his skin. I think you're hallucinating.. Yea, Makky's really youthful. But late in the day, his mustache grows out like my dad's. But he's pure with a fresh smile. I think you look really young. Sakura-something... Sakaki, do you want to spar with me,? Alright, at this rate.. Makky's really strong. Amazing! I'll get Umemura-san's heart! My Boss My Hero Knark52nd Dolis Random Emotion Timings from Tianj. Raws from gryzze. "Minami-sensei." "Thank you for enduring my horrible journal for the last 3 months." You're welcome. Feels like it's become a bit lonely. "Lastly, I'd like to give you a present." Present? "Flip me." Iron-face. Iron.. Yuri..? What do you want to talk about? This is just a feeling.. If I'm wrong, tell me... but.. What is it? Get to the point. Are you in love? What? And with one of our students.. An older looking one.. I'm not. No I'm not! There's no way that could happen. I see. They're still kids. And I'm an adult over 20. I see. In Tokyo, there are laws regarding healthy upbringing of youth. No one can become involved with a youth under 18 years old. If you break that law, you'll be apprehended by the police. Wha? Umemura Hikari-san... Is 17 years old, born in March during the first year of Heisei rule (1989). Umemura-san was born during the Heisei? Yes, all of your classmates... Were born during the last year of Showa rule (1988) or the beginning of Heisei rule (1989). I see, everyone's so proper I hadn't even noticed.. I can understand if the police take me down... But getting arrested for something like that isn't even funny. Continuing on.. Her father used to run a company... But now is a laborer at a construction company. Her mother has a part time job... So the oldest child Hikari-san takes care of most of the housekeeping. Born in Heisei, how splendid.. Indeed.. because of that she's often very late in the morning. I... Even for just another second, want to be with her.. And.. Protect her... See her smile. That's all. Then a date should be fine. Really? It'll be fine. You're in prime condition. Yea.. But Umemura-san.. Do you think she l-l-l-likes me? What do you all think? What do you guys think? She likes you, yea? She likes you, probably. She definitely likes you. - Really? - Yes. Really? Really? Really? You think so too? Seriously, you're fine. But..but.. I'm way dumber than Umemura-san... Plus I was born during the Showa, so I have the oldest looking face in class... Will my good points really get through to her? They'll get through. They'll get through loud and clear. Damn it! I'm so jealous of that Umemura punk! Really? Who do you think you're calling a punk?! Don't get carried away and call her by name without using -san!! I'm sorry! However! You, a lady killer, should have nothing to fear. That's right. There is nothing you cannot obtain. Please think positively. OK. I tried thinking positively. I'm the wife of a gang leader. You guys. Mess them up. Yes ma'am! Not bad. The Class President of Love! Love Hunter! Love Hunter! Love Hunter! - Stop it. Hikari~ Makio~ Hikari~ The first date is about leaving school together. Leaving school together? Yea. Just say, "Want to walk back together?" Want to walk back together? How cute! When you're walking back together, it's all about "Agnes Road." "Agnes Road?" It's a special road at this school only couples can walk. Oh, that small path out by the back gate. Right. Along that path there's a park and shops that sell ice cream and stuff.. When I was a freshman I accidentally took that path alone. That happened to me too! It was awkward, wasn't it?! It was so sad walking it alone, tears came from my eyes. Agnes Road? If two people take that road together and enjoy it... They'll become a real couple. I see. I see. The typical pattern of events is: the Photo Booth, eating Ice Cream, then talking on the bench. Photo-booth.. Ice Cream.. Talking on the bench? Talking..on..the...bench... For now, just successfully invite her. Even though you're ten years too slow for Umemura.. Ok, I'll do my best. Hikari? Sakaki-kun... Umemura-san... Do you... do.. you... y-y-you.. Do you want to walk back from school with me today? Huh? Yes. I'd love to. I'll see you later then. Aniki! You did it Sakaki! Yes.. Alright... Sakaki Makio... Is gonna get Umemura's heart at Agnes Road!! This is... Agnes Road? It's Hayasaka-kun and Mita-san.. Seems like they've been going out since the Test of Courage. This is my first time... Shall we? Yes. Will Hikari be Ok? Huh? Sakurakoji? Hagiwara! What are you doing? Huh? Mikky! The little brother? Are you worried about your big brother? Um.. yeah.. You two are really close! Lets go together! I've wanted to take this path at least one time as a couple before I graduate. Sakurakoji, let's go. It'll be awkward to walk here alone, right? Wha? No topic.. I have no topic..! What have I been talking to women about until now? Cars? Golf? Precious metals? Gambling? No, I can't.. Should I compliment her clothes? No.. She's wearing her uniform.. That's right! Her hair! I'll compliment her hairstyle! The part in your hair is pretty. Huh? It's like... so perfectly split in the middle. Oh.. Is it weird? I have no time in the mornings so I just tie it like this. It makes me look lazy. No, it looks really good. Seriously. It shows your straightforward personality. Weird. This is fun. Eh? The breeze feels good. You're right. The mood seems pretty nice.. Yeah, it's moving along smoothly. Is that... Point 1: The damn photo booth.. Let's take our pictures. So this is a photo booth? It's fun. Point 2: The damn ice cream. Wha? 350 yen for a ring is way too cheap! This is expensive.. Reduce it to 300 yen? I've got cram school now, so I'm out. - Great work. - Thanks. Sakurakoji, are you fine with just watching? If you like that person, tell them or you'll regret in. Because Hikari and Makky have no clue. Later. "Like"? I knew you were after Aniki!! We're childhood friends. We lived in the same apartment complex during elementary school. We always played together. Then during junior high and high school.. She gradually became more mature... cuter.. Now I can't properly talk to her anymore.. Makky's tall amongst other things so she looks better paired with him anyways. I'm going home. It's good that they're happy together. Point 3: The damn bench.. Huh? Huh? Oh.. um.. Today is an a-wa-re (beautiful) sunset. Yea, you're right. So what do we do after this? Go to a bar? No.. Alcohol is out of the question. A casino? Cabaret club? Something more Heisei.. Sorry, I have to go. Eh? I have work all of a sudden. Work? I see. If it's Ok.. Want to come along? Excuse me? Huh? Who's this? She lives next door. Her parents sometimes ask me to watch her for an hour or so. I get 500 yen. My little brothers, Hayato and Asahi.. And Azusa.. Little sister, Nozomi. - Hello. - Oh.. Hello. - Could hold her for a second.. - Hey Sis.. Sis.. Wait a sec.. - Sis! - What? Where are your parents? They're still at work. Hey Sis, where's my cram school schedule? It's hanging on the fridge, right? Give me your lunchbox. Hry, who's he? Hey Sis, when's dinner? I'm making it right now. Clear that area. - I'll be going. - Have a good day. "Have a good day..." Ow! Hey! Just because you're young and cute doesn't mean you can do whatever you want dammit. You sure are cute. Huh? This is your special "challenge" pen. "Admission on Recommendation"? It's the catalog for the university I'm testing for. I was aiming for a national school, but it looks impossible. So next week I'm taking that school's test because it gives financial aid. I see.. If I decide on a school early, I can work a lot more. Itadakimasu. Itadakimasu. Help yourself. Oh thank you. Itadakimasu. Azusa, stop watching TV and eat. OK. Good.. Make sure you eat your carrots. OK. This croquette looks good. Did you put more effort into them this time? They're the same as always. What an ordinary.. What a peaceful scene.. Azusa, turn off that TV. No! He really likes that show. I like it too. - You do? - Yea. Boys always want to be the hero. You got it, Sakaki. Really? I don't like it much. You don't? Hmm.. Everything is always solved with violence, right? Yea.. When I was young, my dad's company went under. Men looking like Yakuza came to our home. My father got beat up right in front of me. I couldn't do anything.. I could only cry.. It was frustrating. Thats why I hate violence. I look down on people who fight. I won't forgive them. Sorry, this talk about the TV show has nothing to do with this. We sold our old apartment and payed off our debt. But I still remember it sometimes. What will you do after you graduate? Something about taking over the family business? Um.. This is really delicious. So? Good. That's right.. What am I thinking? -Was it good? -Yeah, it's great. Thank you. I'm no hero.. I'm a demon.. A demon above all.. A demon like me.. Wanting to protect her... What a nice dream I was dreaming. Know how to get to the station? It's straight ahead from here. Thanks for today. Let's go somewhere next time. I'll really make lunch. Park.. - A movie sounds nice too.. - Umemura-san? What? I.. I am.. Young couple found! What are you guys doing flirting around at a place like this? Let's go. Hold up! - This girl is way cute. - Want to go out with me? We have no business with guys. Beat it. Hurry up and go somewhere. Ow! You punks... "Men looking like Yakuza came to our home." "I couldn't do anything.. I could only cry... It was frustrating." "Thats why I hate violence." "I look down on people who fight." "I won't forgive them." What are you doing!? Sakaki-kun! Wanna go somewhere? Stop, please! Don't get in our way and just leave. Sakaki-kun! Sakaki-kun! Let go of her, please! Stop! Let go! Let go of her, please. What's with him? Hey, stop! Let her go, please. What's up with this guy? Let's get outta here. Sakaki-kun? Sakaki-kun?! Sakaki-kun! Sakaki-kun! Aniki, get a hold of yourself. Aniki! Master! Are you alright? How could something like this happen to you? - Find out who did it. - Yes sir. Forget it! It hurts. Aniki.. It hurts, damn it. Up until now.. Being called Yakuza.. Being called a Villian.. It never bothered me.. Leave me alone. But what about your wounds? It's fine. Please! Kazu. Kazu! This Wednesday after school there will be a physical exam in the gym. Our class will be there sometime after 4:30 will start when the sophomores finish. As you all know, participation is optional. Um.. Sakaki-kun. Yesterday Sakaki-kun.. I'm fine. It's nothing. Sorry for being late. Sakaki-kun! Excuse me. Laugh! Ok. His wounds probably still hurt. He's probably embarrassed you saw him being so uncool. He'll come around in time. You think so...? Did I do something to make him hate me..? It's fine, Makky isn't that complicated a person. Cheer up. Ouch. Does it? But your recovery rate is amazing. Such severe wounds healing this much in only 3 days... But the wounds of the heart still haven't healed, right? Sensei. I... I'm lying. To my friends.. Even to you.. I'm lying. Really? That's why.. It doesn't matter that it's hurt.. Makky.. Good morning, Makky. Good morning. Early aren't you? Making sure you don't run into Hikari? That's not it. Jun-kun and Sakaki. Azusa, what's up? Sis forgot this. Ah! Umemura-san's "challenge" pen. Sis has a test today too.. Huh? That's right.. She's taking the test now. Sakaki, bring this to Sis. You won't make it. Sis was saying that you're a hero. She was saying, "Saving me from the bad guys.. He's like a hero." Please, Sakaki! Go, Makky. I'll think of some kind of excuse to tell Sensei. If you don't go... I will. Excuse me! Stop! Umemura-san! Umemura-san! Is Umemura-san here? Umemura-san! Umemura-san! Ah! Umemura-san. Sasaki-kun! What's going on? Here... Do your best on the test. No way. All for this? Today is just the interviews. Huh? I'm happy. Thank you. You'd better get back. Lets meet at the park from before after the test. I'll be waiting. Next, St. Agnes Academy: Umemura Hikari-san. Here. Jun? Makky... Said he couldn't make it so he asked me to go in his place. Oh.. I see.. He could've just sent an e-mail.. I bought pudding too. I have no idea what he's thinking.. I don't want them to go to waste, so you want to eat them together? That's right, you don't like sweets.. Thanks.. "I'm hiding things from my friends as well.." "I'm lying.. To my friends.. Even to you..." It's a bit boring without the journals, isn't it? Sensei... I.. I've learned yet another lesson. There are things I can't obtain. I.. I've learned many things at school. And had many joyful experiences. But now... I'm in so much pain.. Even though I look like this, I was strong. Since my mom's death I've never cried once. In fights... In anything... I've never lost once. But even so.. Why am I so weak? I.. I was better off not knowing things like this.. If it was this painful... I was better off not knowing about youth. All I can say is.. Come to school tomorrow.. There will be times when you become hurt, also times when you're in agony. But even so.. Come here. Come to school, study, talk, and eat lunch. And when you overcome your sadness.. You'll definitely be stronger than you are now. That's true strength. You're not weak. Don't worry. You'll be Ok. Why did father say such a thing? Saying that he'll make me take over if brother can't graduate. When he never intended to.. Boss once said: Master has the physical strength. And Master Mikio has the brains. If the two combine their strengths and take over. There would be nothing more wonderful. Are you interested in working with the gang? Not particularly. But I have no intention of working beneath my brother. During college I thought about saving up money and starting a business. But this direction might be more interesting... Just kidding. Hey Kuroi-san? Will you become my ally? I was able to have a nice dream.. "Days Until Mid-Term Exams." Yo.. I mean.. Hello? Hello, Makky? Sakura-something? It's Sunday, what's up? I'm almost at your house. Can you meet me right now? Huh? What do I do? What do I do?!
