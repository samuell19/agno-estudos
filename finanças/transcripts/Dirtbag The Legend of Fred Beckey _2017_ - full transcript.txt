[music playing] -[beep] -[Fred Beckey] Hey, this is Beckey. This is Beckey. Fred Beckey. This is Beckey. Fred Beckey again. Again, again. Hey, I'm trying to get ahold of you. Hey, man, you're hard to get ahold of. I know, I left you a message yesterday. I've called about 35 people. Hey, listen, I wanna talk to you about a trip that I have planned... I'm leaving right now for California and then Arizona, then Utah. I called you over and over. Hey, where are you, man? Are you off on the moon somewhere? An Apollo mission? Hey, listen, I'm really pissed off. P-I-S-S-E-D. I got some free time now, you know me. I have more free time than money. Try to give me a call back as soon as you can. Call me back if you can. So, give me a call back anytime... It's not gonna be that big a chunk of time in your life. [Alex Bertulis] Fred Beckey is an enigma. There'll be Freudian psychologists that will analyze him long after he's gone to the next world. [Yvon Chouinard] He's totally obsessive. That's who Fred is. You know, obsessive behavior can lead to absolute genius. [Corey Rich] There is so many urban myths and legends that surround who Fred Beckey really is. [Steve Marts] He was driven like no man I've ever met, relentlessly. [Eric Bjornstad] One track mind most of the time. If it wasn't on women, it was on climbing. [chuckles] [Conrad Anker] Fred chose this other lifestyle. [Barry Blanchard] He created his own culture. He became a culture of one. [Allen Huxley] I suppose you could say he's like the Bob Dylan of mountain climbing. All these great achievements, but completely inscrutable, and no one's really sure if they even like him or not. [Yvon Chouinard] He's a dirtbag, and because of that, I don't think he'll get the recognition that he really deserves. [music playing] [Fred] I don't even really know what motivates a person to climb. To me, it's some kind of a combination of adventure that has a certain amount of risk, depending on other people. Almost any climb has some uncertainty. You never know, there could be a rock fall, an avalanche, somebody could get hurt. So there's certain amount of adventure. I mean, some people may think it's an adventure to go on a cruise ship to the Mediterranean and that's great if they wanna do that. To me, it's no adventure at all unless somebody bombs the ship. You know, good climbing today. Good climbing. Yeah, I enjoyed it. Pretty good. Hope I didn't fuck you guys' movies up. [Todd Offenbacher] Is there anything more important to you than climbing? It's hard to say. It's hard to say. I like to write and accomplish something. I should have brought a pencil with an eraser. That was a fuck-up. I should know better. [Todd Offenbacher] How is it that you can climb as well as you do still? Really, what's the secret? [Fred] I don't know, I don't think I have any. I don't know. I don't take vitamins, and I am not a health food addict. I just try to keep active. I was drawn to Beckey in my book The Good Rain because he's a mythic figure. There are very few mountains left in the world that nobody's ever climbed. And in the climbing world to be credited with a first ascent, being the first human being to climb a mountain, is considered quite a big deal. [Barry Blanchard] It's hard to imagine anyone in North America starting to do any form of climbing and soon not hear about Fred Beckey. [Royal Robbins] His name is everywhere. This is the guy from Pacific Northwest, and he climbed all over the United States, in Europe, in Canada. He was there before the rest of us were. [Yvon] Certainly no person in the history of climbing has ever amassed so many first ascents. [Conrad] What makes Fred special in my book is his unending quest for new routes to do something unexplored. [Timothy] His contemporaries, say in the 1950s or the 1960s, those people ended up on the cover of Life magazine. That to me has been one of the great mysteries: Why did the best climber of all never go on to the greatness that they all did? [birds chirping] [music playing] He is the ultimate dirtbag. He was the first dirtbag I ever knew, and, you know, we all became dirtbags eventually, but he was the leader. [Eric] Because he climbed so much, he didn't ever work at a job, like nine-to-five, you know, five days a week, like most people. [Alex] In the Alps, there was a tradition of dressing up formally for alpine climbing, and Fred, he looked like somebody that just came out of a homeless shelter or someplace. He had his own style, there's no doubt about that. He was different. [Ed Cooper] He had a pink Thunderbird, and we all wondered what kind of vehicle is that to load climbing gear into. We couldn't understand it. [Alex] That T-bird did not give him good mileage, but it got a lot of laughs. And of course, it was the ultimate pick-up car for women. [Fred] I just bought the car on a whim as of kind of a joke. It was a good road car, actually, but a little bit of a gas eater, and I drove it all over the country. Must have put a hundred thousand miles on it. [Barry] We have a whole culture of dirtbagism and road tripping in North America, and Fred's the grandfather of it. He's the grandfather of the road trip. [Ed Cooper] The legends about him driving halfway across the Western Continent, you know, to do a pinnacle in Arizona and then to do some climbing in British Columbia, and then go back to Montana for another climb, those were all true. That's what he did. You know, a lot of people, a climbing trip is two weeks, Fred would start off in spring, climb through the summer in the mountains and the high peaks, Wind Rivers and the places and then, in the fall, wind up in the desert. [Steve Gunn] * There's a constant motion * Makes you feel like the ocean * * Moving through the seasons and I'm hoping for the best * [Eric] He's just so restless, always living out of his car. His second home, for a while, was my basement. [Barry] Climbing actually doesn't cost that much money, especially the way Fred plays it, it doesn't have to be that expensive. Food is really available in North America if you know where to look for it. [laughs] [Yvon] You know, he'd go to restaurants, and he'd pick up 10 packages of ketchup and sugar and stuff 'em away. Make up the eggs, put a little McDonald's sugar in here. -Breakfast sandwich. -Nice. [Todd] All of us, kind of, look at Fred going, "God, how can we get a piece of that. How can we get that Fountain of Youth that lies within Fred Beckey." I don't really know what it is other than just his spirit and his mindset because if you watch him eat, he eats like shit. He eats tons of fast food. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke. but he'll hang onto a piece of food for weeks, and pull it out of his backpack and eat it. I got some cream cheese that I swiped somewhere and still... it's edible. I remember driving with him in the car on a road trip somewhere, and I took that empty McDonald's coffee cup and threw it away, and real quickly Fred started questioning me, you know, "Have you seen my cup? I had a cup around here." He proceeded for the next five hours to look for the cup, talk about the cup, bitch about the cup, "At McDonald's, you get free refills with an empty coffee cup. he'd been hanging on to the cup for, who knows, probably most of the summer. [Yvon] Fred had this sport coat that he bought for 25 cents. He stuffed pieces of this Louis L'Amour novel that he was reading, stuffing it inside the liner-- made a down jacket out of it, basically. He bivouacked in that, and then the next morning, burned the thing to heat up some tea. [laughs] He is the ultimate, the consummate dirtbag. You know, living as unobtrusively on the edge of society, as is possible for human to do. And to still have a focus on something. He was not a druggie or drunk, or anything like that. He was an addict, but his addiction was climbing. [announcements on P.A.] [Todd] Once again Fred Beckey had a mountain that was unclimbed, scoped out. Now a lot of people said before the trip, you know, is he gonna be able to do it? What happens if Fred Beckey dies? And I think we all just kinda laughed and said, [Todd Offenbacher] "Fred's gonna do it with or without us." -[Fred] Where is this village? -[man] From Kanding. -It's around two hours... -[Fred] Down here. Of the unclimbed challenge, I think... you're looking at Pakistan, China, Greenland. China alone has just got a wealth of beautiful, unclimbed peaks in the 5000-, 6000-meter range. Hardly anybody knows about 'em. I think it's a thirty years dream. I cannot believe that Fred would come back now. He's eighty three years old. [birds chirping] -You recording all this? -[Todd laughs] Do you guys got some first-aid stuff? I do have a roll of duct tape. I got lunch food. I got... a lot of lemon powder. [Todd laughs] Lemon? All right... Anyone that's ever taken an international third world trip into the mountains, knows how brutal the travel can be. [horns honking] Are you excited to get into the mountains, Fred? If you get too excited, you wet your pants, you know? [Todd laughs] [David] How's your head feeling? It's OK. My thinking is that, we don't want to hurry it too much with the acclimatization. I think we are in a pretty comfortable spot at his point. He seems to be doing OK. And that's the goal, to get him as rested as possible because it's a big push. [Reinhold] It's boring to go to the mountains, from the fifth year of your life, up to the ninetieth year of your life. This is boring. I hope you're filming all this. [Timothy] Reinhold Messner is largely recognized as the best mountaineer ever, the guy who climbed every major peak without oxygen. And there's this climbing called "Alpine style," which is climbing quickly and without oxygen. and for that matter, without a supplemental expedition at your base. Beckey was doing that when he was in his teens and twenties, when everybody else was saying you need a group. His experiences and his climbs, I would say his ocean of what he did and what is in his soul is so big, that he could give away forever. Why he is going to China to hike up a mountain? It's not necessary anymore. It's much more important, and much more intelligent, that he uses his last years to do something creative. [Todd] You think you can make it to the summit, Fred? On this trip? [Fred] I don't know, I hope so. [wind howling] [Ralph] Get some good sleep last night, Fred? -No. -[Ralph] No? At least the weather looks better. Right now, it stopped snowing. You can see the mountain, yeah. We've got a window of opportunity with the weather, it looks like. Yeah. Yeah, I hope it lasts. You think you want to go up tomorrow? [sighs] I haven't decided yet when I want to go up. I'm just not sure I'm really, if I don't think I can keep up, I'm not gonna. There's no point to it. [Todd] Yeah, get some sleep today, get some rest. Seems like you're feeling better. -[Fred] Take your time up there. -[Dave O'Leske] All right. -OK. -OK. If we need an extra day, take it. [Todd] OK, Fred, we're gonna try and go early for the Summit. Just keep plugging away slow. -It's a hell of a job. -[beep] [Todd] It was sad that Fred couldn't get up there and climb with us, and do what he had done so many times before in the mountains. [Helmy Beckey] Fred was born in Germany, 1923. Our parents came to the USA with my brother in 1924, a good 10 years before Adolf Hitler got into power. As kids, we were together all the time. That's my mother. and that's me in the middle, Helmy. And there's Fred, known at that time as Wolfgang or Wolf. The neighborhood kids kidded him around. they laughed at him because of his name, Wolf. And then he changed his name to Fred, because he didn't appreciate being laughed at. He went into the Boys Scouts, and they went hiking and climbing. [Fred] We did some small peaks in the Olympics. I liked it, I had a good time, I enjoyed it. I felt it was a lot more fun than doing any team sports and I kind of appealed to me. It was kind of fun. And I think just one thing led to another. [Wolf] There's a glacial boulder in Seattle, it has about six or seven climbing routes, and I started a little climbing class for the older boys. [music playing] It was there that Fred and I struck up our friendship. By 1938, we were beginning to do climbs in the Cascades. [Fred] I met some people my own age who were taking the course, and we went on trips of our own. [Lowell Skoog] You started to see a new kind of mountaineering in the Northwest. Maybe three or four climbers going out on much more adventurous, remote trips than their predecessors had done, and really starting to explore all throughout the Northwest and in the Cascades, where Fred really devoted lot of his energy. [Jim Donini] The only real Alpine mountains, lower 48, are in the Pacific Northwest. So they had this playground, like a mini Himalaya, right in their backyard. When Fred started way back when, a lot of those beautiful peaks never had anybody on their summits. [Fred] The first... first ascent, we went to Mt. Despair. Probably, today's climbers or even the most skilled ones don't have a real deep feeling of what it's like to try a route that nobody's ever been on. Fred was talking about his climbing and talking, talking, talking... and he dragged me along, you know. [laughs] 1940, here's some pictures of the first ascent we made of Forbidden Peak. That was my first-first ascent. Scary... [laughs] Frightening. [Dave] What did your parents think about you and Fred climbing? [Helmy] I don't think they knew how... dangerous things got sometimes, or how scary it was. I think they understood that there was some danger out there, but there wasn't much that they could do about it, except forbid us to go, and that wouldn't have worked either. [Fred] Yeah, I probably am pretty independent, yeah. I don't think many kids 17 and 19 would take off for Mount Waddington when they're still in high school. Uh-uh. Uh-uh [Colin] That second ascent of Mt. Waddington which Fred and Helmy did when they were 19 and 17 years old, that's a hard route today. It's probably been climbed less than 10 times total. [Nick Clinch] Waddington was a huge challenge for North American mountaineers. The best Sierra Club climbers went up there and tried it, and then it was finally done by Fritz Wiessner who was considered the leading climber in the United States. [Barry] It's mind-blowing to think that these two teenage boys from Seattle spent a month and a half in the absolute wilderness of British Columbia. [Fred] I still can't even remember how we put that together. We must have somewhere taken a bus out to a big grocery store, and bought all our groceries for six weeks. That's a lot of groceries. [music playing] [Fred] We made a menu up, and then we repeated it. I had it all figured out, little squares. packed it up in cloth bags. So I got a cloth bag, you know there's everything you need for three days. We would never have gotten that trip off the ground if it hadn't been for Don Mundy and his wife. They set us up with a guy who had a fishing boat and he took us to the head of Knight Inlet, dropped us off. Adios. We spent, maybe, two weeks relaying back and forth loads. [Conrad] This is ferocious bushwhacking through coastal temperate forest with downfall the size of telephone poles. [Peter Croft] They've actually called Waddington the mystery mountain because for a long time it was a blank spot on the map. If it had gone horribly wrong, it's hard to say if they'd even ever be found. [Fred] I once fell into a crevasse. My brother essentially grabbed me by the collar and pulled me out. And that could have been the end of the trip, the end of more than the trip. [Helmy] At the very, very top Fred did the leading, you know. Right in where it's really hairy. Scared, frightened. I don't know about Fred. He never mentioned it to me. I was, "You just look down," you know. You just don't. [Fred] Spent the night essentially on the summit, a few feet below. Must have been shivering, all we had were sweaters. [Helmy] I had my 17th birthday on top of Waddington. "Hope we live through the night." We didn't sleep, we just... sweated it out, you know? Coming down was more dangerous than going up because we were coming down in the late afternoon, and by then, snow and ice on the ledges had loosened up, rocks were coming down. My brother got hit on the knee. [Helmy] God, that hurt like holy hell, I'll tell you. Thank God I didn't get hit on the head. [Barry] This is the second ascent of what was at that time the hardest Alpine climb in North America, and two teenage boys walk up, do that, and the whole world shifts. It sucks the feet out from under all the men because men are trying to do this thing. [Fred] We were a little bit surprised ourselves that we managed to pull it off. We got our pictures in the Seattle newspaper, that big. Unless you rob a bank, it's kinda hard to get your picture in the paper. [Alex] During the early years, they were inseparable. It was during the epic Waddington expedition that Helmy sustained a rock fall on his knee. and injured it badly. Ever since then, Fred and Helmy drifted apart. Helmy ended up going to Europe and he became a successful opera singer. But once Helmy stopped climbing with Fred, Fred no longer took any interest in Helmy's life. They rarely saw each other. [Helmy] Our relationship deteriorated because he continued to climb, and I did not climb anymore. Forty-two, the war was on then. Fred had to go in the army. He was in the mountain troops. He was instructing climbers and skiers. He didn't have to go to Europe and fight. [Todd] What did you do in the army? -[Fred] Very little. -[Todd laughs] I was in the mountain training corps, taught snowshoeing. I don't know what there is to teach but... you know, you spend half the time freezing your butt off. I spent more time on the railroad than I did anywhere else, just going from place to place. [Bob] He was discharged before the division went overseas. I don't know whether it was a medical or what... [Dave] He never talked to you about that? Never talked about it. [Steve Gunn] * Night climb. Window * Down the water, ground below * * Whatchya doing, where you going * * Where you end up when the morning comes? * [Fred] I think the next, I'll have to go through my cobwebs in my little peanut sized brain, the next biggest thing I did was to get together with Cliff Schmidtke and Bob Craig, and went to Kate's Needle and Devil's Thumb. [Bob] I think Fred had read somewhere in the Sierra Club Journal about this great mountain. I certainly didn't know about Devil's Thumb. But Fred was an encyclopedia of available mountains that hadn't been climbed. I was just out of the navy. And Fred called me, "Everything is all set. we got lots of food up on the glacier. Come up to Wrangell, Alaska. And I'll meet you and we'll go up to Stikine River, and make this climb." Typical Fred enthusiasm and not very much more detail than that. [Fred] He and Schmidtke said they had agreed to come up in about a week the next boat. Several parties had tried Kate's Needle, But nobody has tried Devil's Thumb. Waiting out the weather, we eventually climbed Kate's Needle. [Bob] We made three attempts on Devil's Thumb, and had to retreat twice, and on the third attempt, we got to the summit. And we were running out of food down at our camp. We're cooking some of the last remaining food we had, and Fred handed me this bag, which I thought were beans. I poured it into the pan, and we melted some snow and I suddenly looked at him, I said, "Fred these beans don't have anything in them except maggots. Where did this come from?" He said, "Well, Helmy and I had it on Waddington." [laughs] So, we ate this stew of beans and maggots. We were pretty hungry at that point. [music playing] [Sybil Goman] Fred was lively and addictive, and very outgoing. There's some sort of magnetism there. [Alex] He burned through women like a gypsy went through horses. [Yvon] He has a real soft place in his heart for tall, dirty blondes. [Bob] There's a certain kind of girl that frequented roller skating rinks, Roller Dames, Rink Rats. [Jim] I know guys that wouldn't introduce him to their women or let him stay in their homes. [Don] Beware of Beckey: he'll steal your women, he'll steal your climbs. -[Dave] Is that true, you think? -[Alice Liska] Oh, yeah. [Jim] He's had a lot of girlfriends. And he does it with the same tenacious quality that he does his climbing. [Alex] He met this very attractive woman by the name of Vasiliki, skiing at Stevens Pass. And they hit it off. [Fred] Vasiliki was her name. She actually called herself Betty. She came from a Greek background. [Alex] Fred named a series of rock spires, not only after her, but also after her favorite drinks. [Vasiliki] It's an honor, I guess. He put me on the map. What can I say? That's wonderful. This has been over 50 years now that people have said, "Are you the Vasiliki?" "Yes." "Well, I've climbed you." And I say, "Oh, OK." [Timothy] When I asked him about that, his face was startled. and it was like I caught him in something. He goes, "How do you know about her?" She was the one, the one great love of his life. It turns out she marries one of the most famous people in the Northwest, Bill Dwyer, a federal judge. Vasiliki chose the judge instead of the dirtbag climber. But, I guess you can't blame her. Maybe it's a good thing that she turned him down because Fred would have actually gone for it and not kept climbing cutting-edge routes for another 50 years. [Vasiliki] He was a very interesting man to me not because he was a mountain man, but because he was so well read and he used to give me old books of poetry, he was a different sort of creature. He moved more than a gypsy, I think. He was just gone, but he's come back to write. I liked that sense of freedom to go. He was not free from his passion, but he was free from everyday things that the rest of the people are involved in. And he just was driven to this way of life. [Todd] Do you think you'll ever get married? [Fred] I think I... yeah, sometime I should. I should try it out. Yeah. -[Todd] What would be the perfect-- -[Fred] I don't know. [music playing] I am the daughter of Scottie, who was a girlfriend of Fred's for several years. Probably around '49 to '52. In 1950, they went on a trip to Europe together. My mother said she was gonna go skiing and ran off to France. And then at some point, Fred came back and my mom stayed on. When they broke up, my mom and Fred went to the court to separate their personal items, So who knows, you know, did they elope? This is probably the most significant relationship in her life before she met my dad. Even years later after my mom was married to my dad, Fred would call sometimes and try to get her to run off with him. [Eric] Yeah, he always had women in his life. Rarely had the same one for a very long time. Sybil was one of the exceptions. [Sybil] He invited me to go on lots of climbs and just hang around basecamp, which, with Fred, a weeklong trip would usually morph into three months. Now some things that people don't know about Fred is he likes opera, he likes libraries. Fred did have some tenderness and romanticness in him. Everybody knows Fred has a strong personality and consequently we had a lot of fireworks and a lot of sparks. We just, kind of, drifted apart and back together, and apart. I think what he wanted was a satisfying playmate. [Alex] A good number of years, he was living in my townhouse. Quite often he would bring lady friends over, and I could hear Fred talking about the most personal issues in his life, which he would never think of doing with his best friends. Here was this very secretive and reclusive legend who was opening up his innermost feelings to these women that he's only gonna see for a few days, I wish some of those women would have had tape recorder and just recorded it because it would have made interesting reading. [beep] You guys go ahead, if you want to. I gotta get some water. I don't why you're taking movies, I'm just climbing like shit. [Ed Cooper] All climbers know about his climbing accomplishments, and he's probably made more first ascents in North America than any other climber ever will. But there's another side to Fred that I think is very interesting, and that is that he is a scholar. He must have spent thousands of hours in libraries researching, even a college professor could hardly get out that amount of work in a lifetime. [Layton] Well, every time somebody opens up a guidebook in an area where Beckey's climbed, they're gonna be following his footsteps, whether they like it or not. [Ed Viesturs] Beckey's Cascade Alpine Guides, that was like our Bible. Every week we'd pick out something, where we wanted to go, what we wanted to climb, and we'd have Beckey's book with us and we'd memorize what he said, you know, very detailed information about not only how to get there, what moves to make, what equipment to bring, how long it would take, the attention to detail was amazing, and the fact that he did most of the climbs that he wrote about is even more amazing. [Jim] The guy knows more about the mountains of North America than anyone that's ever lived. You can't go climbing with Fred Beckey without Fred having a piece of paper shoved into his pocket and some pens taped around his neck on, like, a piece of string. Sometimes, the most inopportune times, you hear him shout, "Hold on a second!" And you look down and he's in the middle of a pitch, like, scribbling notes about some obscure section of, like, an obscure pitch. [Fred] Kind of a big ledge. Trees going right. What are these? Mahoganies? -We got three bolts up there? -[Todd] Yep, three bolts. [Corey] He's like a mad scientist. He doesn't know what he's wearing. He doesn't care if there's stains on his clothes. Fred has one focus, which is climbing and documenting climbing through his topos. [Fred] Went out here, to kind of, like a little ramp. -Yep. -There's a block and you step. -Yup. -I still remember that. -I stuck here and you went up there. -[Todd] Yep. -OK. -[Todd] Either one is, bomber. OK. Either one and 155-foot pitch. [Corey] And he has all of those notes cataloged in the Fred Beckey way, shoved into closets and shoe-boxes and FedEx envelopes in his house. [Fred] I got about 90 topos at home of different routes. And I got 'em all glued together so I can carry 'em around and show 'em to people. And I got it 'em all organized by state, or area, you know. Whatever. [Corey] The amount of data that, you know, it's almost like Fred Beckey, the super computer. If there was an encyclopedia of climbing, it's, really, it's inside of his head. OK, go up this crack, about 20 feet, you'll see it. And cut out to the right. It's very obvious. You look up there, you'll see a giant horn, looks like a dog head. You know. Cut the right, you'll see the gully, you can't miss it. You'll have fun. [Dave] So did you ever study writing techniques? Or did you-- [Fred] No, believe it or not, I never did. -[Dave] Really? -[Fred] Never took a fucking course. I think taking a writing course would have just fucked me up totally. [Timothy] He chained himself to a desk at the Oregon Historical Society trying to produce this greater book about the history of the Cascades. [Fred] I was all over-- National Archives, you name it. Practically every research library on the East Coast. I should've had a girlfriend, hanging around with me to keep me company doing all of this stuff. [Fred] Did Range of Glaciers do okay? [Fred] Not money-wise, not for me. The money has never been very good. It should've been. I blame... I don't know who to blame. The public, the Internet The books that are really selling are these self-help books. Dr. Phil... I am OK, you're OK, you're not OK, I am OK, you're an idiot. You know, how to improve yourself. How to increase your sensibilities, how to make love, how to make this, how to do that. There's whole shelves of 'em in Seattle, I looked at, a whole eight feet high, that wide. Self-help psychology... How to improve this... how to improve... Jesus Christ! There must be a lot of people that are insecure. There must be. It's not my kinda thing. You know, not at all. But, I mean, I'm not knocking it, great. Good for Dr. Phil. He's probably making $10 million a year on that stuff, but... [Fred] I'm trying to put together a bit of a hybrid, to kinda, portray the mountain or the route, access, route description, summary, picture, map, topo. All my friends say it will go over. But they're my friends, so I'm not sure I trust them, you know? Originally, I had in mind, the name 100 Classic Climbs, That was the first idea and somewhere the last couple of years, I went bonkers and forgot all about the numbers and just kept writing and writing, and the last time, I have a list of the climbs, I counted 137. Can you believe it? There was four climbs when we started with him that he still hadn't been able to do, but he wanted to put in anyway, 'cause they're such classics. [Fred] I feel very strongly that I want to have done each of these climbs or made a good solid attempt on it. Tentatively, I've included them. In fact, that's one reason I can't really finish this thing until the fall, as far as totally finishing it. Just as an explanation, and part of this is my idiosyncrasies involved in it too, I admit that. [Fred] I'd like to do Assiniboine It's not a hard climb, but it's interesting, and kind of a big, high mountain. [Don] With a character like Beckey, going back becomes almost a routine, it almost becomes expected. Well, if I miss it today, I'll go back tomorrow, or next year, [beep] [Fred] I wanted to jump you into going to Assiniboine. Its dry now. Excellent conditions. The weather is good. This is the optimum time to do it. Let's get going on this. [Jim] He'd go back, and he'd go back, and he'd go back, and damn it, eventually he'd get it done. [beep] [Fred] We're going up to Mt. Monarch, near Waddington. Hell of a mountain. Be a great place to do some filming. [beep] It's the most important trip of the summer for me. -I want to be sure it does not fail. -[beep] I realize this is almost impossible short notice, but I've done stuff like that before, Just jump on an airplane, "To hell with it all," and just get out. [Barry] A lot of mountain climbing and alpinism is mastering the art of suffering, and a lot of it is, torturous, laborious, physical work. I mean, it's hard and it's uncomfortable, and you're cold, and you're hungry and you're wet. For a guy like Fred, I am sure within his first decade, realized that he was in love with the process. [Ed Cooper] Fred really enjoyed the mountains, more than just, let's say, making a first ascent or something. He truly loved being out there. [Don] Fred Beckey is, in my opinion, a poetic genius. Where the poetry is the beauty and wildness of unchanging nature and the challenge of the heights. [Fred] It's hard to describe, for me anyway... You might call it a sense of awe, a sense of amazement, a sense of just a different view than you get from the valley. And it's a very temporal one, obviously because you're not gonna be there very long. You know, most city sports, like take football, you can quit, and if you're pooped out, off you go. But in climbing, you're in the middle of a wall somewhere, and the weather's coming in, you got a lot of commitment. To me, there is endless beauty involved in these things and depending on the conditions and the weather and times it's changeable all the time. I think there is a certain satisfaction that builds up naturally, it may even compare to winning a ball game. There's a good feeling about it. Different than going to work everyday, you don't feel any better after the end of the day. At least I don't. [Timothy] One of the things that Beckey is really bad at and this is to me, a virtue. He lacks self-promotion. Other people would have, not only entire lines of gear with their name on it, he would be a household name. [Alex] He had opportunities to endorse products and be on the back page of every climbing magazine, he never followed that opportunity. Because that would compromise his real ambition, and that was climbing. In other words, he was not for sale. [music playing] In his prime he was the consummate all-around climber. He could climb rock as good as anybody, if not, better. [Steve] I've known a lot of climbers but he was singular and he had this drive that was like the whole universe is coming down in a spiral at that point. And that's Fred. [vintage narrator] Fred Beckey, climbing leader of the party. At 30, one of America's foremost mountaineers. [Conrad] A year after the first ascent of Everest in 1954, Fred Beckey did the All-Star, Grand Slam, Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, all wrapped into one season in the Alaska Range. First ascent of Mt. Deborah, first ascent of northwest buttress of Denali, pretty challenging routes, seldomly climbed now and then the first ascent of Mt. Hunter. [vintage narrator] Seventy miles of pack out after climbing a mountain, but they're all smiling. They've nearly won. Behind them is the summit of the north face of Mt. McKinley. Twenty thousand feet of Arctic mountain climbed, a mountain beaten. [Conrad] Whenever I think about, "Oh, how badass am I right now?" It's like, "I'm soft, I'm light compared to Fred in '54"" [Interviewer] If you were to be remembered by a single climb the most important or most significant climb that you've done, what would it be? [Fred] Probably Mount Deborah. it's the one that scared us the most. [Henry Meybohm] I had heard about Fred Beckey before and then I had the chance to climb with Fred Beckey. Really? Yeah! [Henry] When you are in Europe and you climb in the Alps, whatever you do has been done a few hundred times before. And when I was in Alaska I heard about unclimbed mountains. Huh? Okay, let's try! [Fred] Heinrich Harrer had heard that we were up there climbing on McKinley, and we just sort of met up near Fairbanks, and we just joined forces. [Layton] First ascents, you never know. There are all these mysteries and, you know, what's gonna happen up there? How difficult is it gonna be? You know, a lot of unknowns. [Colin] You don't know exactly what equipment you'll need you don't know where the difficulties will be, how hard it will be, what the descent will be like, and first ascents are coveted because of that. [music playing] [Jim] To do that in 1954 given the state of the equipment that people had then, given the methods that you would use to get there because this is, you know, remote wilderness, And the body of knowledge then, I mean, that's phenomenal. [Steve Gunn] * You were lost * On the road from a different way * * Pushed too far * Miles away [Alex] In 1963, when the American Everest expedition went to the Himalayas, Fred Beckey was undoubtedly the foremost climber in America. [Jim] And Norman, when he was choosing the Everest group, deliberately passed over Fred on the theory that Fred didn't play well with others. [Norman Dyhrenfurth] In '63 he applied. I said, "Fred... no." [Tom Hornbein] It was felt that Fred was not as much of a team player, and I sensed that some of that came from what happened on that Lhotse expedition. [Norman] In 1955, I finally got the permission for Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain right next to Everest. I had... two Swiss, one doctor, and I had three Americans and Fred Beckey was one of them. I knew his reputation, and I'd read in the American Alpine Journal and I knew that he was a good climber, yes. But I also knew that... he had never been invited on an expedition. [Ed Viesturs] There's some compromises that you have to accept when you go on a Himalayan expedition with a big team. You gotta accept that I might not get a chance to go to the top I've got to be a team player, I've got to contribute. He didn't... hit it off too well with the others, there were Austrians and Swiss. The Europeans called him the "prolete," which means proletarian. [chuckles] He was a likable guy, he was a good climber. He meant well... but he didn't always do the right thing. And he left our doctor at our high camp. [Fred] I was in a tent with Bruno Spirig, he was a doctor, he was a Swiss climber. We were camped at roughly 23,000 feet. Wind picked up, it was really a bad storm, the wind just tore that tent apart. And Spirig started feeling bad. Some of the party were camped I'd say about 1,500 vertical feet below us, and... there was a choice, what was I gonna do? [Norman] He left him alone and came down to Advance Base and everybody was aghast and said, "Why did you leave him alone?" He says, "Well" He didn't even have a sleeping bag. Sure, I could have stayed there, but what could I do for him? We had no radio communication, I felt the best thing to do was to go down to get help. Help might've come up that day or the next day, but who knows? I felt it was more urgent, and the best policy was to go down to get help and then come back, and I came back up with them. [Norman] The next morning, I went up with my friend Angobar and Fred Beckey, and the three of us went up and we got him down, the doctor. But ever since they couldn't figure out why he didn't stay with him or bring him down? After this thing, things changed. [Nick Clinch] It's a huge difference between second guessing somebody and being there when you have got to make that decision. You have got to do this, and these are the factors. [Jim] The first time I heard about Fred was, I was just a young kid. He was a little different but, you know, nature is diverse and so is humanity. My life was more, I guess you would say, structured. And I would definitely say that Fred's life was unstructured. [Timothy] His contemporaries, they founded companies, they were like movie stars for a while, they were glamorous. They were like the astronauts of mountaineering, and Beckey was left out. [Tom] To imagine Fred being the first American to climb Everest and substituting him for Whittaker I can't imagine Fred to be the... the sort of the public persona of the expedition. It's a hell of a responsibility and I'm glad it was Jim who I think could manage it and thrived on it. [Helmy] Who was Whittaker other than he climbed Everest? But these are guys that get to talk to the President of the USA, and are big heroes, you know, because they're the first Americans to climb Mt. Everest. [Jim] I was never attracted to any dirtbag style I wasn't that far out of the box. My whole life wasn't climbing. It was Fred's whole life, actually. I would have liked to have gone... I'm sure. But, since I wasn't invited, all right, so you weren't. You know, sorry. Sorry. [Timothy] There's these pivot points in life where you could go one way or the other. Beckey had about 10 of them, and at every turn, he stayed in the climber bum, dirtbag lane, he never turned off. He never took the exit to respectability, he never took the exit to an easy life he never took the exit to branding Fred Beckey. Would he have liked to? I mean, the proof is in the life. [Fred] Can't say I've had any regrets, at least I haven't thought about it. I really don't like to dwell back on the background. You did what you did, forget it. You know, look forward to something new. [Conrad] So, he missed out on these big expeditions and these trips at the time were what professional climbers were doing. You were either part of one of these big trips or you were out there forging your own path. And Fred was forging his own path. [Alex] While the Everest expedition spent a whole season climbing one peak and only a handful made it to the top, Fred spent the same amount of time doing dozens of first ascents all over North America. [Timothy] You could take, in isolation, probably a dozen Beckey peaks. Any of those dozen would make a career. But then, expand that by a factor of ten, and Beckey was just knocking them off one after the other. It was like, tell me a place that's unclimbable, and I'll be there on Saturday. He was astonishing people. [Ed Cooper] In those early days, Fred seemed to be climbing almost all the time. In fact, many of us wondered where he got all the money because he never seemed to have a job or work. [Don] No one really knew much about how he made his living or what he did. [Yvon] He had no money, I mean, he was working, I think as a paper salesman in those days... [Eric] When I first met him, he sold insurance and he usually had a company car... [Steve] He didn't work at all. I don't know quite how he did it. Then the big rumor... came along, there was this plane crash on Slesse, and the rumor was that there was all this gold aboard. Fred was trying to get people to go into Slesse with him. Some of us began to think, well, you know, maybe he actually got in there and got hold of that money. And that's why he was able to, you know, spend all his time climbing. [Alex] He put away money, and we never will find out how much, but he put it away in stocks... [Fred] How much do I have on the market? That's all? Well, I can't buy anything with that. OK, great, Thanks. How about this macaroni and cheese? [Dave] What do you say when someone asks you what do you do for a living? [Fred] It depends who it is. If I don't want to talk to that person, I just tell 'em, "Adios." None of their fucking business! [Timothy] When I got to know him, he was sort of twitchy whenever he was at sea level. He doesn't do well when he's not in thin air. Yeah, I wish they'd make the law, "Car first. Pedestrians, fuck 'em." Like China, Bangkok or Europe. Here, the fuckin' people walk out across street and don't even look! [Timothy] It's like he was in prison or something when he was in the city. The mountains are the only thing that made him comfortable. -[beep] -[Fred] Hey, this is Beckey. Can you rent a car? But we've got to get out of here. The weather might come in on Sunday, and it'll fuck the whole damn trip up. -[beep] -Beckey again! I called you over and over. The whole trip is not going to work unless we get going. [beep] Hey, this is a crisis. This is Fred. You have got to be here on the 12th, on Saturday! That was our agreement! You cannot be here as late as Monday! We are losing the whole weekend. [Rick Ridgeway] He called me up couple weeks ago to check in on how the book was coming along, and I said, "Well, how are you coming along on the climbs?" He said, "Oh, I got weathered off last year, but I'm getting all geared up, we'll get it done. We'll get it done before press time." [Fred] Don't take movies of me, I look kind of ugly this morning. [Jeff Wenger] Ah, you look great. -[Jeff] Hey! -[Fred] Anybody want agua? -[Jeff] Sure, I'll have a little. -[Fred] Yeah, it's free. -[Jeff] How many times have you been up here? -[Fred] Too many. Just, things just haven't clicked. Sometimes my fault, sometimes the weather. OK. [breathing heavily] Good lead. I'm not doing very well. Shitty. [Todd] I do see Fred get really defeated by not physically being able to do it, because mentally he still thinks of being able to climb this stuff. He still wants to climb Lucky Streaks, and believes he can. Hope I climb better than this tomorrow. Fuck. I didn't set any speed records on that, man. Kind of fun, though. Hope I didn't embarrass you guys too much. [Jeff] You did great, man. I don't know, I feel a little clumsy. [Todd] Very quickly after the defeat and the self doubt he's real quick to just turn right back around and somehow just erase all that from his brain and start fresh that he wants to climb Lucky Streaks again. Ah, maybe I'll go back next year, we'll see. If I do, I think I'm just gonna go up and climb three pitches and just bail out. Fuck it. [Jim] One thing about alpine climbing-- if you can't handle rejection or failure, don't even go there. [music playing] [Jim] We were in Bishop, California. It was a Saturday night, and we all went to a country western bar, and there were lot of women. Fred's there, and there's this table with about nine attractive women in their, maybe thirties. He'd go over, and he'd tap one on the shoulder, and she'd look up at him, you know, he's 35 years older and... "Hey, uh, hey, would you like to dance?" And, "No." And then, "Ok." You know, he'd go to the next one, "Hey, how about you, would you like to dance?" "I don't think so." But he went right around the table to, about the fifth or sixth one, and the most attractive even. And she said, "Sure, I'll dance." And they went up, and they disappeared, and we never saw him again for three days. [chuckles] Persistence pays off. [Fred] Something like that? -Yeah. It's good. -[Annie Musselman] Yeah. [camera shutter clicks] You want me to smile or grouch or... [woman laughing] [laughing] You're great. -[Fred] You're tall, what are you, 5'8"? 5'9"? 5'8". -[Annie] 5'8", yeah, and a half. [Fred] You haven't done any rock climbing at all? -[Fred] It's all right. -[Annie] Kinda scary. -[Fred] Yeah, sorta. -[Annie] You don't think? -[Fred] It is scary. -[Annie] Yeah. [Fred] But lots of of other things are scary. [Annie] Yeah, that's true. [Corey] Fred Beckey in his late 80s is more motivated for expeditions and has more ideas for what he would like to climb than any other climber, and it's because he's thinking about this stuff 24/7 for 80-plus years. [Yvon] Still now, he's not staying in motels, he's sleeping on the side of the road and hasn't changed at all. [Fred] OK. I guess we're out of here. I probably won't get back till July 12, 14th, maybe. -[Dave] Mm-hmm. -I'm not sure, you know. [Barry] One way you knew you made the North American climbing landscape was you'd get your first Fred Beckey phone calls... [beep] [Fred] Fred Beckey, let's get together on a climb. Actually I'm taking off, I hope today. I'm trying to get something together to go to Canada... Yeah, I'm hot to go on this thing as soon as we can get mobilized. [Don] In a way, you look forward to communications with Fred, and in a way you looked a little bit with dread at the next time he's going to give you a call. Right now, I don't know what I'm doing except tomorrow. I have no idea. Are you in Alaska? OK, you just got back? I've been trying to get hold of you, as you probably know. [Steve] He was persuasive, yeah. He'd get you the phone. He'd analyze the weather-- the "weddah," as he called it. [Fred] Called the weather man, it's supposed to be good. What do you think of this awful summer weather? I was trying to call Canada today and I may call some ranger up there like the ice fields and get an idea what is really happening. [Jack Tackle] How many thousands of people have gotten a call in the middle of the night, you know, "What's the weather doing there?" "Well, Fred, it's fucking dark out, I don't know. [Fred] I think conditions here are pretty darn good right now. The weather's excellent. Actually got room for another guy. Three would be perfect. [Alex] He would do his best to convince a guy to go climbing. [Fred] You're pushing your luck sometimes, like you might get high blood pressure by just working too hard. [Alex] He'd hound you until you caved in. [Erik Harz] He will not rest until you call him back. There's no blowing off Fred. [Fred] Shit! [Erik] Especially if he knows where you live, like, you don't know, he could just, -like, show up at your house. -[Fred] I'm Fred Beckey, remember me. Hey, we're right in front of your house! Fucking system, I got to do something about this. I'm on your street, but I don't know where your place is. Gonna stop by. Well, are you the one with the fence? [Todd] If you've ever seen Fred's filing system it's a series of different cards rubber banded together, in different areas. Phone numbers scratched out, more current phone numbers, addresses, what days a person has off. I've seen him fill this out on the phone. "So, what days are you off again?" And, "Oh, Thursdays and Fridays, I can climb with this guy." He thinks nothing of making that late night phone call. He just pulls in and just would throw his sleeping bag down in our driveway and crash out. I remember having kids walk past in the morning going to school. One of the kids said, "Why do you make your grandpa sleep in the driveway?" [Alex] In the early '60s, Shiprock only had one route on it. So, any other ascent would result in a first ascent, and that was Fred's forte. So he tried to recruit Eric Bjornstad and me to do the climb with him, and Eric agreed to go with them and I didn't. [Eric] When we went to Shiprock in the early '60s, the lady that I was going with at the time had tattoos over about 80% of her body. And Fred just hated her. [Fred] I really don't even know why he brought her. She was not a climber. What was she gonna do there all that time? You know, I think it was a really bad choice. [Eric] I spent 20 days on the Southwest Buttress of Shiprock with Fred and this lady, and finally had a falling out with Fred. [Alex] When Eric decided to quit, Fred just couldn't handle it. And of course they were out there in Fred's Thunderbird. Fred wouldn't even take Eric to the bus station, so, Eric and his girlfriend had to walk across the desert. [Eric] We hiked back out to the highway, which was several miles, and then hitchhiked back to Seattle, and Fred would dog us he would follow us in the car staying within view... and then as we'd get let off, he would drive by slowly. [chuckles] And he did that all the way into Oregon. He then got on the phone, you know, every few hours and would call me at my office, and so when the phone would ring, the boss would answer the phone and it'd be long distance and it'd be a long discourse of how great the climb is, and how good the conditions are. "Oh, yeah, Eric, you know, lost interest, you know, there was no big problem." Which was all a lie. My boss started getting angry with me because, you know, I was getting paid by the hour. I figured, hey, I've got a raise coming, So, I kind of asked my boss for the raise, and when he didn't give me the raise, it was a good excuse to quit and join Fred. [Fred] When Eric and I were there, it was too windy, too cold. And when Alex came, everything changed. It got too warm. [Alex] We were within 200 feet of the summit when Fred decided that we couldn't go any further because we only maybe had a cup of water left in our last bottle. He was adamant about going down, and I was adamant about going up. And Fred, I think, almost had a nervous breakdown. Eventually I felt exhausted just arguing with him and I said, "OK, let's go down, but I'm not coming back up again." And he said, "That's fine." [Fred] Luckily I'd been in touch with Harvey Carter, who I'd climbed with before. [Eric] Harvey came out and met Fred at Shiprock, and within half a day they reached the summit. So, the first ascent of the southwest buttress was Fred Beckey and Harvey Carter. But Alex had spent a whole week on the climb and I'd spent 20 days on the climb. [Don] We have an important announcement. We're standing on the summit of Mt. Seattle. [Don] The culture of that time was one of personal pride. If you were a climber, you kind of felt that you were a little bit special. [Eric] It was very appealing to do something that few other people could do. And back in the 60s it was pretty esoteric, you know. Why people climb now I think is totally different. [Peter] Some people talk about the sport of mountaineering, or the sport of climbing, and for me it's just, what sport is so much about is rules. You have to follow the rules, I think what defines being up in the mountains and climbing, is that there is no rules. [Ed Cooper] It was a fierce competition in those days. We didn't really get along well. I had my ideas of what I wanted to do, and he had his ideas of what he wanted to do. The first ascents were the thing. [Fred] Cooper might have been one that... he was interested, maybe sometimes interested in the same climbs I was, and that's fine! You know, there was some competition. But sometimes I joined him on climbs, too. [Ed Cooper] It became a little bit of a game. He wouldn't tell his partners where they were going, in case the weather turned bad and they never got there, then he wouldn't tip 'em off about this first ascent that he wants to do. [Alex] Fred was only focused on climbing, and his partners had to be dedicated the same way. And he never felt sorry for you if your climbing ended up in a divorce. [Dave] He's had to leave a few burning bridges behind, in order to live the life that he's wanted to live. [Eric] He went through dozens and dozens of climbers. He would have falling-outs with them, and he was a difficult person to be around, but I got along well with him because I admired Fred for his climbing ability and just overlooked the other faults that he might have had. [Nick] Now, climbers are a pretty single-minded bunch. But he's more single-minded than the single-minded bunch. People thought I was a fanatic, they thought my friends were fanatics, and that's nothing, nothing compared to Fred! [Ed] He would kind of talk almost constantly. [Yvon] Fred will wear you down. [chuckles] He'll repeat the same thing over and over again, and that can drive you nuts. [Alex] There were three subjects that he would talk about. Of course, the first one is mountains. The other, of course, weather. And the other subject was women-- women he'd dated, women that he wanted to date. Women he should have dated. Those were the three subjects that you were stuck with when you were in a tent with Fred. [Dave] You think people considered you sort of a renegade climber? They probably think I'm pretty independent. That's all right, I don't care what they think. I could care less. [Timothy] There was a school of thought that he was unsafe, that what comes with being a spectacular pioneer is recklessness. People died climbing with him. [Dave] Have you lost a lot of friends in the mountains? [Fred] A few, yeah. Dick Berge on Mt. Baring. That was a bad one. And we lost Charles Shiverick in an accident on Mt. Serra in the Mt. Waddington area... or Waddington Range. Very unfortunate. I feel very, very, very bad about it. Many climbers have lost some of their best friends climbing. it's not for everybody. It definitely is not. [Timothy] There is an element of luck involved in these risky sports. They never pinned the blame specifically on him for these deaths. It was more like, he lived and they didn't. They took the fatal wrong step. But, there was enough there for the gossips that he developed a bad reputation. [Fred] If risk appealed to me, I'd go out in the jungle and you know, hang around the lions. [Ed Cooper] He was, to my knowledge, never injured seriously in an accident. That's quite a feat with all the climbing that he has done. [Layton] You were guaranteed going back in the mountains with Fred, you weren't gonna get lost at least. He knew exactly where he was all the time. He'd spent enough years in the mountains to know that if you were gonna continue doing this sort of thing and survive, well, you gotta be careful. [Yvon] The reason I'm alive today is probably because of Fred and the things I learned alpine climbing with him. There were probably 250 serious climbers in America. I didn't know who Fred was when I first met him, but then I started realizing that he's one of the few guys that actually searched out hard alpine climbs. [vintage narrator] Beautiful Mt. Edith Cavell in Canada. Many have wanted to scale the North Face of this mountain, but no one has ever dared it before. [Yvon] When we tried to sign out with the park warden, he wouldn't sign us out, he said, "It's suicide." And so we said, "OK, we're gonna go do it anyway." [vintage narrator] 7:00 a.m., the men set out, to risk their lives, and there it is. Are they worried? You doggone right, they are! But the goal is greater than fear. [Barry] It's an interesting combination where you have Yvon, the young Yosemite specialist, apprentice to the master mountain climber. [vintage narrator] Not many of us can endure such a prolonged struggle. But Yvon and Fred and Dan keep their goal in mind. [Fred] We knew we could climb the peak as far as the difficulty goes. The danger is rock fall and possible avalanches. We had a bad lightning storm that pretty much frightened us. So, that night we bivouacked 500 feet below the summit. [vintage narrator] Suddenly, the struggle is over. And they become the first men in history to climb the dangerous North Face of the summit of Mt. Edith Cavell. There'll be time to congratulate themselves later, when they return to the everyday world where congratulations matter. [Yvon] We got back down, and there was a note on our car from the warden that said, "Good work, boys." [Fred] After we climbed Edith Cavell, Chouinard and I went to the Bugaboos and that's when we had our eyes set on the South Tower of Howser. That's the ultimate in climbing, is to do a first descent on a beautiful line. [Conrad] Fred's a climber's climber. He chose to do good routes that were challenging, that were aesthetically beautiful. [Jim] He has an artist's eye for the lines. [Corey] What Fred has given back to climbing is thousands of routes. [Jim] There's probably no human being on the planet that has more routes named after him. The Beckey this, the Beckey that, the Beckey Direct, the Beckey... [laughs] [Steve Gunn] * Hey mister shadow wreck * Cruel and dusted mind [Jim] He was a very good researcher, which gave rise whether or not this mythological notebook actually exists. [Todd] You've always heard about this black book that Fred Beckey has. [Dave] Of all the unclimbed peaks that he still wanted to do. [Peter] It's become legendary in American climbing. People whisper that somebody found the black book. [Todd] The black book... [Fred] There's no black book. That was in the haul bag until Tehipite Dome. No. I don't know of any black book. I would never have put a black book... Why would I put a black book in a haul bag? I mean, it doesn't make sense. People make up stories. I've never had a black book. [Alex] He didn't need a black book. He remembered every mountain that he ever saw pictures of, or climbed, or from the summit looking over to the next range. He knew what he wanted to climb, and he remembered those details. [beep] [Fred] Hey, listen. I'm planning on heading down for Russell and Whitney in a few days. But we wanted one more climber, we need somebody, but so far we've had no luck. I've called about 35 people, this is the only way I can do it this year. It's the only way. [Yvon] The fact that he still has these high standards of routes that he wants to do, and he's really, we all know he's really not capable of doing 'em. I don't think it's ego, I think he's just an idealist. Fred loves the mountains. And he still wants that lifestyle of having his car full of gear, just in case. He's a climber. He's not gonna give up till his last breath. [Jim] You know, you damn well wouldn't want your kid, to grow up to be Fred Beckey because of this exclusive focus, this unnatural focus. [Timothy] Other people have moved on. They had normal lives, they had families, they had wives, they have grandkids now. They have their place in history. Fred never did. In some cases, he may be a sad lonely man who doesn't have anything. But I think he also appreciates the fact that he can still do what most of us can't. [Dave] There's almost this morbid fear of being the one who's with Fred when he goes. Am I gonna be the one who's known as the guy who killed Fred Beckey? -[Dave] I can grab your pack, Fred. -[Fred] Ah, that's OK, buddy. I feel guilty. [Dave] Hey, Fred! -[Fred] I got a guilt trip. -[Dave] No, the main thing is that you get up high. -It doesn't matter how you get there. -Yeah, it does. [Yvon] When I see him, I think, "Gosh, he's so much smaller than I remember." I remember him being so much taller and straight. Now he's getting... you know... Like all of us, he's getting there. [Dave] What do you think? [Fred] I don't know, man. Don't take movies of me, shit. I used to just run up here. Maybe not run but... You better save your battery. I'm aware that you're trying to make a movie, you want to get some climbing footage? You want to get a movie about climbing, not backpacking. Me walking uphill, crossing creeks. I mean, OK, but how much of that is valuable? I don't know. [Dave] How you feeling, Fred? I don't know. I just... Let me lay on my ass here for a minute. Fucking lungs. I mean, fuck, I can't believe it's taken three days to get here. I don't think I can cut the climb, I got no fuckin' energy. We're goin' so fuckin' slow, I'm embarrassed. It's ridiculous. I don't know what the fuck is wrong. Yeah, maybe we just ought to might bail. I don't know. I just don't know how I'm gonna feel. I hate to do it. It pisses me off. -[Dave] Should we get going? -Yeah. It's probably the smartest move. I never deliberate this much. Either I'm gonna do something or I don't do it. [Steve] Well, I think today, Fred, with his age, that he keeps going, and he's kind of living on memories and living on a dream, that he can still do it. I say more power to him. You know, if he does fall off a steep trail or something, I don't think he'd have it any other way. It's hard to tell, was he just driven because through what he did would become immortal in a way? Which it will. [people chattering] Come on, be more like Beckey. -Take care. Yeah. -[man] Good to meet you. -Don't lose the books. -I won't, don't worry! In recent years, there have been a number of people who have recognized him for what he is, the last of a dying breed of wilderness explorers. [cheering & applause] [people laughing] I was perfectly OK, until about three years ago. Up in the Canadian Rockies, I started feeling funny. Don't know what it is. I'm probably lucky to be alive. And I've got a whole rack of medicines that the doctor wishes I would take, but I don't do it. Everything from A to Z, which probably- vitamins, vitamin C, which would probably help. I probably should do it. You want any candy? Definitely get some donuts, I like donuts. Trying to gain some weight. The best donuts are the Canadian ones, but they don't have 'em here. Favorite kind of donuts are jelly donuts, some kind of raspberry or jelly or something, or those donuts that have cream puff inside of 'em. They're pretty good. We're here in Canyonlands National Park, near the sight of Moses. This is the first time I've been back since 1972. I welcome the chance to climb in a different environment and the Utah desert is about as different, from my background. I thought it was very beautiful. And unusual, I- it took me a while to get used to the rock. I used to come out here for climbing practice. I think I was one of the earliest people to climb on the rock. [Conrad] Fred is sort of alone here in the States, and who's his family? Who's his support network? You need to have community to stay healthy. Fred's family is the climbing community. [beep] Right now, I have a driving problem-- the drivers license people don't think I'm a good driver. Maybe I'm not, but I think I am but whatever. It's difficult because I'd like to get somebody to go skiing with this weekend, and I'm not even sure who I have. I may not be able to find anyone. Are we going ski touring tomorrow on Blewett Pass... Can you please call me back? I hope this works out. But do call me, I'm waiting and would like to hear from you. Bye Bye You wanna go down by the beach? My brother was two and a half years younger than I was. He did everything I did. One time, my brother and I found a couple of logs, and we nailed boards together and we made kind of a makeshift raft, and then went and paddled across over to Vashon Island. [Helmy] We went a hell of a long ways out. freighters and ocean liners would come along. [Fred] One ship did come by. This ship created waves and wakes. I was worried that it might shake the raft apart. It's about three miles over to Vashon Island. We stayed on the island maybe a night. We abandoned the raft over there. We took the ferry boat back. I think maybe we were pushing the limits. I think we were pushing our luck. I sure wouldn't dream of doing it today. [Helmy] I don't talk to Fred, you know, 'cause he's always too hard to reach. [Dave] Have you talked to Helmy? [Fred] I made a trip there, we had some communication problems. He's having a tough time hearing. [Helmy] He came to visit, you know, over here, but not to see me, but to go into the Dolomites. He changed his lifestyle. He's just totally interested and immersed in music, which is OK, but I think he overdoes it. [Helmy] I'm proud of him. He's a real hero. And he's the most modest damn person in the world, you know? There must be a lot of people that are just plain resentful or jealous... 'cause Fred is different, you know? [Fred] Wanna pick up a duck? [Dave laughs] They either hate the guy or fear him, or love him. [Fred] I don't know if I'm contributing. I'm not sure I am. I hope I'm contributing a little bit to mountaineering education, people's knowledge of the mountains. I think the dirtbag thing, I don't know where it really started. I don't feel that I've been a dirtbag. I've always had a car. And I've always had a purpose. The first ascents I've done, going to Kate's Needle and Devil's Thumb, Mount Hunter, Mount Deborah in Alaska. The Waddington trip I don't think you could call that dirtbagging. [Dave] So, do you feel like you did everything you wanted to do? [Fred] Never, no. I just scratched the surface. Obviously, with climbing, it's endless. You know, you can make a hit list of things that you want to climb or places to visit. I'd love to go to Majorca, the islands in Greece, I haven't even been to Thailand. And even in North America, there are mountains in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana that I haven't even climbed, Mexico, all of South America, I've never done anything there. You can't do all these things. But I don't regret having done it, it may be better to look forward to it, maybe I'll get there sometime. I'd like to unwind and get younger, but I guess nobody's figured that out yet. [Dave] You have any single one thing you value most in life, -[Dave] that you value the very most? -[Fred] Stay alive. [Todd laughs] That's important. [Timothy] When we study individuals who break the mold, we should not just study artists and scientists and authors and architects. We should include Fred Beckey among them. Beckey was trained classically, but then he just smashed the model. Sometimes it just calls for a single-minded bastard. [Alex] So many of us grow up and are stuck in dead end jobs and can't get out of 'em. You see this person who has pursued his passion and has pursued it passionately. And we all know instinctively, that's what I should have done from the time I was 18 years old. [Fred] You know, I could say to heck with it and go play golf. Take up cards. Sit around the picnic table. It's a lot more fun, a lot easier. But I guess I have a certain amount of motivation or drive to go out and do these things. Why, I can't explain it. I'd rather do something than do nothing. Put it that way. -[wind blowing] -[panting] [Jeff screams] Come on, Fred, get up there! -[Dave] Yeah, do it! -Yes! Yeah! Woo! Yeah, buddy! Nice, Fred! [Fred] Lots of fun. [Vasiliki] What I believe about most people is as they get older, they don't necessarily get any wiser. In fact, rarely. They just become more so what they've always been. And I think, probably, with Fred, it's the same thing. He is... ...etched in stone. [music playing] [Steve Gunn] * There's a constant motion * Makes you feel like the ocean * * Hey there nature driver man * You are a welcome guest * Man with that wicked eye * Will lead you to your rest * Moving through the seasons * And I'm hoping for the best I remember once climbing at Cal Dome with Fred Beckey, and there was this swarm of bees up ahead on the trail. So we all shouted to Fred, "Hey, Fred, you know, there's bees up there!" You know, Fred couldn't hear shit, "What?" And he walked right through the bees, and, you know, one or two must have stung him, and he kind of just like slapped himself and grunted and just kept on walking. And all the other guys were like, "Fuck that, we're not gonna walk through the bees." So, they start, like, bushwhacking to cut the switchback, and I sort of in my own mind, I thought, "Man, if Fred Beckey's like eighty-something years old. If that guy can walk through the bees, I'm gonna walk through the fuckin' bees. Like, I'm pretty tough, it's no big deal." So, I start marching up through the bees, and a bee went right up my shorts and just got me right in the scrotum. and I just couldn't... There was nothing you could do. I mean, it's a natural reaction. I ripped my shorts off and I'm trying to kill the bee, and all the guys are like laughing hysterically, like, they just think it's the funniest thing. And it really hurt. And Fred's completely oblivious. We get to the base of the crag about 20 minutes later, and I say to Fred, "Did you get stung by any bees?" "What?" "Bees, like, did any bees sting you?" "I dunno. Maybe, maybe." And looked at his hand and there was, like, a stinger still in his hand, and I just thought, "Goddamn, like, this guy, he is so passionate and so freakin' tough. And that other stuff, like pain, doesn't affect him, apparently." [Steve Gunn] * Highway is fully stacked, * * think we'll turn around. * Go down another road * and through a different town. * * Feel the direction like * a rock upon the moon. * Come on the overpass * and hope to get there soon. * Hope to get there soon. When he said, "I really wanna climb the East Buttress on Whitney." I was like, "Well, why not? The guy's a legend, let's go have a good time." And as we're going down there, he's like, "I think I've got it this time, I can climb, it's just, I have trouble sleeping at altitude." And being a problem solver, I'm already thinking, "well, how can I help this guy achieve his dreams?" And so, the first day we hike up, and we get to camp that night and it's cold, and he pulls out this inappropriately light sleeping bag, with a tiny little Therm-a-Rest. Like, the guy's not gonna sleep. I couldn't sleep in that thing. Every so often, if people have trouble sleeping at altitude, you know, a little sleeping pill kind of helps. So, I grind up a little bit of this sleeping tablet into his tea, and he drinks it, and I don't tell him anything about it. We wake up the next morning, and he's like, "Dave, I feel great, I'm ready to charge!" So that night, there was no appropriate time to slip him the mickey. So, I said, "Fred, I've got a confession, I put a little sleeping pill in your tea last night, and that's probably why you slept well, we should do it." And he's like, "What!" He was just convinced that, that's not the thing to do. So, he didn't sleep a wink, woke up miserable, and we didn't get a chance to climb Mt. Whitney that trip. Dave Nettle had given me a great tip, Just sneak a little bit of, like, a sleeping pill into Fred's drink, Sure enough, gave it to Fred and watched him get drowsy and then, you know, got him into his sleeping bag and, it sounds like I'm drug- like we drugged the guy, but um... well, we kinda did. But the point is, he jumped up that morning, he was refreshed, he slept well, put his pack on, hiked up to the base and climbed the East Face of Mt. Whitney.
