Why didn't you tell me? Why are you quitting? Haru... It's the same. I... Why was I dreaming about the past? Good morning, Haru. Good morning. Let's go. And then, Nagisa still kept eating after that. That's Nagisa for you. And he still beat his personal record. Haru, are you cold? The breeze is cold. It's kind of chilly, isn't it? It's already spring. It's the scent of spring. This time of the year makes me reminisce. Do you remember? When we first met? A dump truck! Where? Wow. It's big! Wait. Are you okay? I'm really glad I met you. Thanks, Little Haru. - Drop the word "little"... - Hey! Haru, Mako. Nagisa? And Rei! You're both early. Spring break is already over. I'm so excited to show off the new me. I can't possibly sleep in! Wow, Rei you're so motivated. I think this running improved my stamina. You're both doing great! I hope the four of us will go as far as we can this year. Well then, Haruka is the regular course fine with you? Yes, that's fine. So... I'll lead today! Wait for me, Nagisa! Haru, let's go. So that's the plan for recruiting new students. This will catch everyone's attention and we'll get new members with amazing muscles! Yeah! This is the Iwatobi Swim Club member introduction. Treasurer! Second year. Hazuki Nagisa. My speciality is breaststroke. My best feature is the soleus muscle. Assistant Captain! Third year. Nanase Haruka. My speciality is freestyle. My best feature is my triceps brachii muscle. Secretary! Second year. Ryugazaki Rei. My speciality is butterfly. My best feature is my deltoid and biceps muscles. And our captain! Third year. Tachibana Makoto. My speciality is backstroke. My best feature is my trapezius muscle. We're waiting for new members with lovely muscles! Welcome to the Swim Club Why? And we tried so hard. Well, all we did was show off our muscles. Wow, Haruka? Thank you. Does that mean he matured? Yes. Honestly, I was surprised by last year's race too. But Nanase and the rest seemed to have learned something from it. As their counsellor I'd think about what I could do for them but was always unsure. I find myself being encouraged by them instead. Many things have happened but I'm glad he's come to terms with his team as well as swimming. Ever since he was little, he was so stubborn only wanting to swim freestyle. They're at that age where they're constantly growing. Youth is a wonderful thing. But Haruka is already in his third year. So is Makoto. I hope they're thinking about their future. I'm sure they'll be fine. Because they're so earnest about swimming. I hope you're right. By the way have you thought about what to do after graduation? Not really. Why not? Rin, you're aiming for the world, right? Yeah, but I've wasted so much time already. This summer's Nationals is my last chance. If I go, I can be scouted. I'll set a record and fulfil my dream. Haru, Makoto. What are you going to do? I... haven't decided yet. You haven't thought about it? This is a city competition so we only have volunteers competing... Rin! Anyway, those new to competing can get the feel of it here. - That's it. - Yes... Rin really looked like a captain. "I'll kill you if you don't do your best" is what I thought he'd say. That's going too far. You're all late. Goro, you're swimming too? Yes. There's a general competition too. It's laid back, unlike the Prefecturals. This isn't bad. But the swimmers lack toned muscles. Too bad there are no relays either. I know. But we can swim at the Prefecturals. Waiting for me? - Rin. - I've been waiting, Haru. Our lanes are next to each other again. You guys couldn't swim much this winter, right? I can give you a head start. That's not necessary. We couldn't swim, but we were training. You seem motivated. Show me the result... I'm going to win! No, I will. I won't lose. We can't compete in a relay today. So it's a race against you and me. I don't care about numbers. You're still saying that? Even if you're not interested in winning you still think you're the best, right? I'll fire up that cold heart of yours. Next are Haru and Rin. Brother! - Haru! - Haruka! Ready. They're both fast. Their distance is growing. Haru, don't give up. Haruka! They're in a league of their own. Haru is amazing. He's slowly catching up to Rin. It's a... Tie. The swimmers in the fourth and fifth lanes, Nanase and Matsuoka have set a new competition record. Haru. You did get fired up. Not really. Let's do the coastal route today. Sure. Since it's warm let's increase our distance to prepare for the competition. - Hey, Haru. - What is it? What do you plan to do? About what? What Rin said. What are you going to do? I don't care as long as I can swim. Typical of you. One more day until the Prefectural Tournament! Tomorrow is the Prefectural Tournament! Tomorrow is the Prefecturals. Everyone, please rest well tonight. Tomorrow we'll meet in the hall at eight. Tardiness is prohibited. Is that okay? Yes. We're all ready. We even have matching swimwear. That's right. Let's confirm our events just in case. Day one is the individual event. Day two is the relay. For the individuals Nagisa will be in the 100m breaststroke. - Rei, 100m butterfly. - Yes. Haru, 100m and 200m freestyle. I'm in the 100m backstroke and 200m freestyle. But Tachibana, why did you choose 200m freestyle, instead of 100m? In the 100m freestyle, I'm no match against Haru. Makoto has been working towards the goal of 200m by increasing your training. I still need to work harder to swim next to Haru. Hey Haru. I have a favour to ask. Men's 100m breaststroke, third group. First is Nagisa's breaststroke. Ready. Go. Go, go, go, Nagisa. Go, go, go, Nagisa. Push forward, Nagisa. Push forward, Nagisa. Go! Nagisa's leading! They're catching up. It's okay. Nagisa's arms will extend before he reaches the finish line. Nagisa did it. He passed the preliminary. Yay! Good job, Nagisa! Makoto's backstroke is up next! Continue the streak and go win. Yep! Men's 100m backstroke will now start. Ready. Go. Go, go, go, Makoto. Go, go, go, Makoto. Push forward, Makoto. Mako is so fast. Makoto passed the preliminary. Yay! Now it's time for my turn. I will show everyone the perfect butterfly stroke. Rei, that's an ominous phrase. Ready. Go. Despite seeming ominous Rei also passed the preliminary. Good job, Rei. Thank you very much. Tachibana, Hazuki, Ryugazaki you all did well. You all qualified for the Regionals in the individuals. Freestyle is in the afternoon. For Haru, we can assume he's already won. Makoto, you're going to swim freestyle too? - Yes. - That's exciting. Hey. Don't forget about my brother's race with Haruka. Haru. About yesterday... I know. Makoto is doing freestyle too? Ready. Go. Makoto passed Haruka? Tachibana is faster than Nanase? What is Makoto doing? Unlike the 100m, the 200m requires you to conserve energy. Doesn't he know that? If he swims like that early on he won't last until the end. Hey Haru, I have a favour to ask. For tomorrow's 200m freestyle I want you to give your all and compete with me. Why? Why did you decide to compete in the freestyle? Do you want to compete with me that much? After this summer's tournament the third-year students will retire, right? So before that I wanted to compete with you, Haru. What are you swimming for? It's to swim with you, Haru... and the rest of the team. But tomorrow I'll swim to win against you. It's the final turn. Haruka is catching up. Yes, but Mako's speed is slowly... dropping. Makoto. I lost! As expected, you're unbeatable... Haru. You're crazy. Men's 100m freestyle will now start. It's finally my brother and Haruka's race. Ready. Go. Go, go, go, Haruka. Go, go, go, Haruka. Go, go, go. Win this, Rin. What's up with that overpowering speed no one can even come close? Haruka won. The time difference is... Only 0.02 seconds. A-Amazing. That was an amazing race! Good job, Nanase. Yes. Although it's a bit complicated for me. Hey, why did you want to race with Haru? I wanted to have a serious match with Haru. I wonder why. Maybe I was envious of Rin. I see. You were amazing today. People will scout you from all over the country. Haru, if you are scouted, what'll you do? Nothing. You'll turn it down? It doesn't matter if they come or not. I swim because I want to. What's wrong? No, nothing. Good night, Haru. No hard feelings, no matter who wins. But you'd better make it to the Regionals. I don't have to be told that. I let you win the freestyle yesterday but not today. Those two will be okay. Take your stand. Ready. Go. His reaction time? It's okay. Tachibana can recover. Good job, Momo! He's ahead of the others. Go, go, go. Makoto is catching up. You can do it, Nagisa! He's not speeding up towards the end like he usually does. Samezuka is still leading as he touched the wall. Rei is doing his best but he can't catch up. Haru! Haru! Rin turned first. Yes! Good job, Samezuka! They lost. But they still passed. They qualify for the Regionals. Well done. You're number one, bro! Good job! Our Swim Club qualifies for the National Championship! They made it for us this year. Last year they recycled the one from the Judo Club. But why doesn't it feel gratifying? Of course, that's because we lost to Samezuka. Makoto and Nagisa, aren't you frustrated? I am extremely frustrated. Although we qualified for the Regionals we still lost to Samezuka in the relay. Let's practise. Yes. Look at this. Makoto, Rei, and Nagisa you all qualified for the Regionals in the individuals. But time-wise, you barely passed. Athletes from Samezuka are on top. As expected, time-wise, we are behind Samezuka. The only event we're leading in is freestyle with Haruka. Iwatobi is nowhere near beating Samezuka just yet. Everyone, don't settle for the results you got. Keep training... Oh no, it's an emergency! What happened, Ms Ama? We got a call... from a scout... for Nanase. They saw your 100m freestyle the day before yesterday. I see. Haru, you did it! This opens up possibilities for you after graduation. There is a saying "Tomorrow is another day but whether you decide to..." Haru. I wonder what Haruka wants to do? Haru wrote "free" on his career questionnaire. Free? What is that? Did he mean a part-time job? I don't think so. Then, a freelance swimmer? Not that, either. Then what? I don't know but to Haru, free is free. I don't get it. But that's very typical of Haruka. We had another call today... Nanase is his usual self. My brother is getting a lot of calls too. So, Haruka will be okay too. Soon enough, he'll be motivated to choose. Is that what Haru wants? By the way, have you chosen what to do after graduation? I haven't made a decision yet, but I might go to a local college. Is that so? Mako, you got "Excellent Luck". "The person you're waiting for will arrive. Will win every contest. Good time to start a new adventure. The direction is North and East." For me no matter what others say, I love the way you swim. There's no theory or calculation, but I felt a strong force and it made me want to swim the way you do. Freely. Rei. So, you should stay free. The word "free" has many meanings. But I believe that the real meaning is not to be bound by anything and to have an independent heart. So, no matter what you choose as long as you can be yourself you are free. Sorry, I didn't mean to tell you what to do. Haru, you came up with this training plan? I added it to Gou's plan. You added relay transition practice. Since we are slower you're planning to make up the time with shorter transitions. - Yes. - With our team work we can definitely gain some time to beat Samezuka. I want to swim with all of you. That feeling is important to me. Haruka. Let's go. The four of us. We'll beat Samezuka, and go to the Nationals. Yes. - Good evening. - Good evening. Coach Sasabe. Hey, it's Makoto. The swim club is very lively. I'm very happy but we're short-staffed so it's busy. I'm sorry I can't watch you practise. No problem. Well, Coach Sasabe about the record from the Prefecturals... Coach Sasabe! Hurry up! Hold on. I'll be there soon. Coach Sasabe. Can I help with anything? - Really? - Yes. Whatever I can do. Mako, you started helping out at Goro's place? Coach Sasabe has helped me a lot so I wanted to do something in return. But we can't just leave you to do it by yourself. We'll help too. Right, Rei? Of course. Thank you. But Nagisa and Rei, you both have things to do. But... Haruka, aren't you worried too? I'm going to swim. Makoto can do what he likes. - Haru. - Haruka. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Coach Tachibana, what are we doing today? Let's start by practising our kicks. Okay! Thank you very much. Bye, Coach Tachibana. Bye. Goodbye. Hayato. What's wrong? Was it not fun today? I hate... swimming. Hayato! Kisumi! Sorry, I'm late. Kisumi? Shigino Kisumi? Is that you? Makoto? Long time no see, Kisumi. Yeah. Long time no see. Since elementary school, right? Is there a reason why Hayato hates swimming? If you know why, I'd like to know. It's probably my fault. One time, our family went for a boat ride out at sea. Hayato got excited, lost his balance and fell off the boat. We immediately saved him, so he wasn't hurt but it must've scared him a lot. I see. He doesn't like the swimming class at school so I want to help him learn how to swim at his own pace at this swim class. - Kisumi... - But if Hayato isn't enjoying it... I... want to help Hayato to swim. Makoto. Hayato reminds me of myself when I was young. That's why I don't want anyone to give up. Including you and Hayato. Makoto, you must really love swimming. Makoto, please take care of Hayato. Let me know if there's anything I can do. Thank you. Haru! Haru? Long time no see. It reminds me of when we were in middle school. It was after Rin went abroad and you looked so lonely. Kisumi, did you go to elementary with Rin? Yeah. And Sosuke too. Makoto. - Oh, it's so late. - Let's go. You're so unfriendly, Haru. This is a long-awaited reunion. We can meet again. You're right. Kisumi! Hayato! Bye, Makoto. And you too, Haru. We should get going too. But Hayato seemed so scared, I don't know where to even start. What was it that helped you? Wouldn't that give you the answer? In my case... when I saw the sky doing the backstroke. I wasn't scared after that. But getting him started with the backstroke is not how it's usually done. That doesn't matter. Just do it your way. Haru... You're right. I'll try it. Hayato, let's try something different today. No need to go under water. You can swim while looking at the sky. There's no way that's possible. I'll support your body, so relax. You'll never drown. It's impossible because... because... I'm scared. It's okay. I'll never let go of your hands. It won't be scary? I promise. Hayato. You can do it. Let's go. Slowly move forward as if you're cutting the water. Hayato, open your eyes. Wow, that's a backstroke! Hayato! Hayato! Hayato! Thank you very much. Hayato. Well, I'm no longer... scared of swimming. It was fun. It's because you tried. Thank you, Coach Tachibana. Thank you. Thank you. Makoto. We just hired a new employee. So we'll be okay now. You don't have to come in after next week. What? You're not happy? No worries. Okay then. Be careful on your way home. Okay. You guys... You're still practising? Ms Ama. Go home on time or you'll get into trouble. The Regionals are next week so we want to practise as much as we can. The transitions really depend on the amount of practice. - One more time, please. - Sure. Transition practice? Yes. For us to be evenly matched with the stronger teams we need to shorten the transition times. Anticipate the moment he'll touch the wall then as he goes to touch the wall, drop your body forward then kick off the moment he touches the wall. The ideal transition time is zero seconds. But transitioning that quickly, what if you go too quickly? Yes, we'll be disqualified. But we can't be afraid of that. If we master this timing, then we can shorten our record. What are you doing so late? Sir! And Mr Principal! We're so sorry! We were about to leave. No, no, it's okay. But, Nanase it seems like you have been scouted. That's amazing. We're proud of you! Everyone is focused on you at the Regionals. Please work hard. Yes. What a big hotel. It's so different from last year. Maybe Gou and the teacher are here and we're put in a tent? Similar to the training camp last year? What are you saying? Yes. You guys are the star. But there is a famous quote. "Nothing is more expensive than something that is free. That price is priceless." I've been handed plenty of funds from Mr Amagata. So please eat whatever you want. Anything we want? I want this. How cute. Mackerel. Haru... Captain Mikoshiba? Why is he here? Gou and Nanase! Good evening. Who is that? This is Mr Toudo who's in charge of scouting for our university. Scout? As an alumnus, I wanted to introduce him to the students in Samezuka. - Nanase? From Iwatobi High School? - Yes. He knows about Haruka? Of course, I do. You're Nanase, right? Freestyle, Nanase Haruka. After seeing your swim at the Prefecturals no one can forget. Not just our university but the other schools are interested in you too. I believe that you have unlimited possibilities with your talent. You can't waste that talent. You can go to a much higher place. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. What? Haru isn't here? He was gone when I came out of the shower. Maybe he went for a run. What? Tomorrow is an important event with so many scouts coming. What is he doing? Did you want to talk to him? I wanted to make sure and see if he had made a decision. But it seems like he's continuing to run away. What is he thinking? But I'm sure Haru is thinking about it in his own way. Even if he doesn't say it. How are we to know that? And, what are you going to do? With your talent, I'm sure you'll get scouted too. I... Haru, Mako, listen to this. Rin? You guys, why are you up so late the night before the event? It's only eleven. What are you doing here? I came to see Haru. But he's not here, so I'll leave. Wait, Rin. We won't lose tomorrow. That's my line. We're proud of you. Work hard. Don't waste your talent. You're our hope. So bright. It's finally here, Haru. What? Today's race. There are probably many people here to scout you. I don't care. Theoretically speaking it's impossible for Haruka to go unnoticed by the scouts. That's enough. Nanase's swim is amazing. There is a famous quote "Don't run away. You'll end up at a dead end." Haruka. Look, my brother is waiting. Hey, let's go, Haru. Ready. Nanase. Swim and show us your freestyle strokes! It's finally here. I'm so nervous. What's wrong, Haru? Nothing. Isn't that the scout from the university? That person over there too. There are so many of them. If you swim well here, you'll get many offers from different schools. Haru... Hey, Haru. Are you really okay? Yeah. It's nothing. It's almost time. Let's go, Haru. Everyone, please do your best. Yes. Let's each give our best and do all that we can. Let's go! Men's 100m backstroke. Makoto! Mako! Ready. Go. Go, go, go, Makoto! Go, go, go, Makoto! Push forward, Makoto! Push forward, Makoto! Last, last, last. Last, last, last. Good job! It's a higher level than the Prefecturals. This is the Regionals. Makoto didn't qualify for the finals. Haru, have you decided? Not really. What do you mean, not really? After Prefecturals, a couple of the scouts contacted me. They came to you too, right? Never mind. Let's talk about this after the race. I'm going now. Men's 100m freestyle. Next up is Haruka. Ready. Go. Haru... Haru! What are you doing? Why did you do that? It's none of your business. Stop fooling around. The scouts are watching this important event. So what? Because the scouts are watching? To make a record in front of the crowd? That's not what I swim for. Then what are you swimming for? For myself and the team. Then swim for your team and for yourself. Don't you know that it leads to your future? Don't you have a dream? Why don't you want to face it? You can... You're the one that doesn't get it! What's the dream? What's the future? That's all yours. I'm not like you. I don't have those things. - Haru. - Haruka. You were all here? It's okay. Nagisa, Rei, Makoto I... will swim the relay with you. That's why I came here. I didn't qualify for the individual. Me neither. But, Rei, you were very close. You were so dedicated to the race I can't believe you've only been swimming for a little over a year. Thank you. You too. You were also close to qualifying. You swam beautifully. Thank you, Rei. Let's work hard on the relay. Is Haruka alright? Of course, he is. Haru said it himself, didn't he? "I want to swim with you." Let's believe his words. You're right. I can't swim in my usual style. Let's do our best and qualify. Yes. Something only the Iwatobi team can do. A person with glasses once recommended a book on mental training. Please tell me more about that book. Let me think about it. Please tell me. Rei, what's the matter? No, it's nothing. Congratulations. The medley relay qualified for the Regionals. Thank you. Wow. Hazuki and Ryugazaki really worked hard. Haruka and Makoto swam amazingly too. At this rate, they can leave a good record at the Regionals too. What's the matter? Since the competition, the time for the relay wouldn't shorten. Is Nanase okay? He didn't look like his usual self at that competition. Haru is staying behind to practise again? Haruka can't swim the freestyle at the Nationals, right? Was that really okay? What do you mean? "I only swim the freestyle." That was Haruka's motto. I saw Haruka swimming and it made me want to swim like that too. But instead of swimming the freestyle, he will only swim the relay. Maybe we had something to do with Haruka becoming the way he is now? Rei, you think this is a bad thing? Don't you want to swim the relay with Haru? Of course, I do! But I want Haruka to always be free and independent. Haru being free... It's almost Obon Festival. Haru, are your parent's coming back? Towards the end of summer. You're independent as always. Oh yeah, let's all go to the Fireworks Festival. Invite Nagisa and Rei too. Yes, let's do that. Bye. Haru. About the career path... No thanks. Wait. It's not like that. Brother! Welcome back. Dinner is ready. Join us too, Haru. Let's eat together. I'll pass today. Next time then? Good night. Look at this. I graphed everyone's time sheet. The relay time is not getting better. Yes. After the competition the individual time has been improving but the relay time hasn't. Our transitions are going well. Then there's a problem with us swimming together? That can't be. This is a serious problem. Coach Sasabe said he'd make changes to the training plan. So, everyone, please work hard to find a way out of this rut before the Nationals. This is... Last year, Haruka made that wooden Iwatobi strap to acquire new members for the club. Rei, you kept it! I wonder if any new students will join us next year. Of course, there will be. Because we are going to the Nationals. There's no way new students will not come into a club with such achievements. But after the Nationals end Haruka and Makoto will be leaving us, right? I wonder what Haru will do. Nagisa... what do you want to see happen to Haruka? I am the same as you, Rei. I want Haru to always be true to himself. So, I don't like seeing Haru conflicted. Nagisa... It's the last competition where we can all swim together. But, are we okay the way we are? I agree. I think we need to tell Haru exactly how we feel. It's beautiful. Yes. Hey, Haru. What is it? Before we swim at the Nationals there's something we need to talk about. Unless we do I don't think we can really be a team. Haruka Nagisa and I were both inspired by your swimming. When we saw you swim freely and unrestrained I wanted to swim just like that. But now that you no longer swim the freestyle your swimming is so unlike you. Haruka I want you to swim in front of a crowd worldwide. And just like us if they can be moved by your swim, and want to swim just like you I don't think there is anything more wonderful than that. Rei... Nagisa... I don't know anymore. Haru. Haruka. Thought you'd be here. Haru... I also think that there needs to be a change. Until now I always thought it would be fine as long as you were happy. No matter what Rin says I wanted to respect your feelings. But at the Regionals, you said to Rin... What's the dream? What's the future? That's yours. I'm not like you. I don't have those things. If you really want things to stay this way I won't say anything. But if you just can't find your dream I... want you to be able to find it. You want me to find it. Can I find it just by wanting to find it? Well... Forget it. This conversation is over. Wait. - Let go! - Listen to me! It's all the same. It's not something I can find, just by searching for it. I'm fine the way I am. Stop lying. You're wanting to find it too. You need to find it and go out into the swimming world. You have that power. Why are you saying that too? Where I swim, or whom I swim for I have the right to choose. I'm saying that I am fine the way I am. It's not okay! It's not okay! That's why everyone is telling you this! Nagisa, Rei, Rin, and even me! We all love you and you're special to us. Why don't you get it? We want you to see your dream and your future. Stop worrying about me! Stop meddling! Dream. Future. Then what about you? How can you talk when you haven't even decided? Say something. I've decided. I'm... going to a university in Tokyo. I've been wanting to tell you but didn't have the chance. I... Do whatever you want! Haru! Who is it? Rin. Haru, we're going out today. Get ready. We're going. Where to? Where else? Australia. What's the purpose of your visit? What did he say? Sightseeing. Hey. Hey. Where are you taking me? Just follow me. We're getting on that bus. Hurry up. Wait. Hey! Haru went to Australia? I don't understand. Why did Rin do that? I talked to Rin about Haru but I didn't think that he would take him to Australia. What's his purpose? Who knows. I don't know either. But I believe that this will be... a special trip for Haru. I hope Haru cheers up. Rin. Rin. Haru. I bought drinks. What's wrong? Don't leave me alone. Sorry. At the last competition... Don't you have a dream? You don't get it. I ignored your feelings and forced my ideas on you. I'm sorry. But I just want you to know this. I've always been... inspired by you. I feel better now. Let's go. Where to? Stop looking so worried. How is it? You feel calmer by the ocean, right? Let's go. I don't feel like it. What's wrong? Who always takes his clothes off first? Shut up. I thought you would refuse to come here with me. I'm surprised you came. What happened? Nothing. I just didn't want to be there. Did you fight with Makoto? I'm right? Who cares about a fight? I'm always fighting with Sosuke. For me... it was my first time. It seems like Makoto chose his career path. He was saying that he wanted to tell you. Doesn't watching the ocean calm you down? The first time I came here I saw this ocean and felt relieved. Welcome back. How have you been, son? How are things back in Japan? I've been doing well, Russell. My, how you've grown. That's because I've been swimming every day. Every day? - You love it that much? - Yes. Still swimming with that old mate of yours? Oh, you're talking about his friend Haru. - Haru? - Rin, is that your friend Haru? Yeah. Haru. Come over here. This is Russell and Lori. I stayed with them. Please start. Have as much as you'd like. Thank you. Haru is just as you described him, Rin. A cool attitude and eyes clear as water. You're right, love. She says you're cool and your eyes are clear like water. Rin says you only swim free. Haru. You only swim free? Yes. - So it's true. - Why do they know that? - Well, because... - Rin really looks up to you, Haru. Every time he talked about you, he was always full of admiration. Hey now... What are they saying? It doesn't matter. It does. They're saying how I used to talk about you. So, mate, you got a girlfriend back in Japan? That is... I guess that's a no. Our boy Rin's a late bloomer. Right. Remember the time he... We don't have to talk about that, Lori. It's summertime in Japan now, right? - That's right. - Isn't summer really hot there? Yes. It's hotter than hell. Rin, Haru. Glad we got to see you boys tonight. Please come back to visit us anytime. I'll keep in touch. Have a great stay. Thanks, Russell, Lori. Bye. - Is something wrong? - No. - It's nothing. - Okay. Let's go. This is ridiculous. Look. Is this common in Australia? No. It's your fault. Because your name sounds like a girl. That's you. No, it's you. - It's you. - No, it's you. - It's you. - It's you. We don't have time for this. I'm going to the reception. Ridiculous. Just sleep. Go to sleep. You're right. Hey, Haru. Remember I told you that I always looked up to you? Maybe you don't remember but I still remember when I first met you. Honestly, I didn't think I would lose to anyone. But instead of being frustrated, I thought there's someone better than me. And I wanted to swim like you. That's why I need you to always swim ahead of me and be there wherever I go. Otherwise, it's not thrilling. I remember that competition too. Remember the spring competition when we swam the free? Where we tied and set a new record? I was testing you then. To see whether you were someone who is meant to end here or not. Then you came from behind and caught up with me and I was convinced. That you were someone meant to be in the same world as me. Haru, did you feel anything at that time? You said that you couldn't find your dream. But if you find it, what would you do? We're here. This is... This is where they have the world swimming competitions. Let's go. Haru, this way. This is where athletes from all over the world have competed. I wanted to show this to you. Let's swim, Haru. We can? Of course. Anyone can swim. I don't have my swimwear. I'll let you borrow mine. This way. It's the national team. National team. They use it for practice. We can swim in a place like this? No one is swimming. There's a recreational pool there too. Those who don't have the courage to swim with the national team won't come. And you? Hey, mate. How's it going? Let's go. I want to swim. Here. Forever. I want to continue swimming. Haru. Let's go. Yes. Haru, Rin. Makoto. You came to pick us up? Welcome back, both of you. Haru. Welcome home. Thank you. Let's go. Everyone's waiting. We're finally getting used to this pool. At tomorrow's event, those seats will all be filled. Rei, are you nervous? No. I've worked hard for this day. I don't have time to be nervous. Did you grow hair on your heart? No, I have not. Makoto will return soon. That late already? Let's hurry. Rei? Will Haruka return to his usual self? Don't worry. He will come back all well. Let's go. Yes. Everyone's here starting today and preparing for the race. I'll go meet up with my team. Bye. Rin. Thank you. Hey. Haru. Haruka. Nagisa. Rei. Welcome back, Haru. I'm glad you returned safely. We were so worried about you. Rei especially... Nagisa! I'm sorry to make you worry. It's okay. In preparation for tomorrow, please get a good rest. After that, we can make the necessary changes before the race. Makoto, Nagisa, Rei. There's something I need to tell you. Until now I never cared about the time or winning and swam because I wanted to. I thought that if I did, I wouldn't know why I'm swimming. So I thought. Rin's dream is to compete in the World Championships. He's heading to that world to fulfil that dream. Then, for me will I go to the world of swimming just because I want to swim? To the world of winning or losing. That's not right. I'm not like Rin. I don't have a strong desire like Rin. That's why I didn't have the answers to what you asked me. I didn't think that a dream can be found, just by searching for it. But I was led by Rin and I saw many things and felt how big the world is. What will you do when you find it? Then, I found it. I want to swim. In that world. I want to continue swimming. So, I'll start caring about the time and winning. For my dream. That trip really became something special for you. Good for you, Haru. If that's the dream you found, Haruka then all we want to do is to fully support you. Thank you. As expected of the Nationals everyone is so fast. Makoto. The other day, I said... horrible things to you. I'm sorry. Haru. I'm sorry too. I couldn't bring myself to tell you about my career path. I felt that I wasn't cut out for the world of competitive swimming. The world of competition is not for me. That's why I was wondering if I would go to a local college. There wasn't anything else, in particular, I wanted to do. That's when I helped out Coach Sasabe. At first, I was just helping out but slowly, it became fun to teach the kids how to swim. That's where I met Hayato and I wanted to teach him how to swim. When I was lost Haru, you gave me advice. Not really. When Hayato swam the backstroke he said he was no longer scared, and that he had fun. I was really happy. That's why I want more and more kids to experience that. The joy of swimming. I want to be on the side that teaches swimming. To learn that, I'm going to a university in Tokyo. That's the dream that I found. I see. I'm sure you'll do well. Thank you. But from now on, studying is going to be difficult. That's true. Will we see something we've never seen before? We will. The four of us. Yes. Let's go. Men's 400m medley relay. Group one tournament. Makoto! Makoto. Ready. Go. This scenery... Nagisa! Rei! Haruka! Haru. Haru. Haruka. Haru! Haruka! It's over. I had so much fun. Me too. I'm so proud that I was able to swim in a relay with all of you. Thank you. Thank you. But I guess this is really the end. Nagisa, you're looking so glum. There's still time before graduation. Sorry, Mako. Nagisa. I'm so glad you invited Makoto and me to the swimming club. Thank you. Rei, you worked so hard. Haruka. Even after this ends we will always be a team. Let's keep in touch. Yes. Makoto. You've supported us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Look, look. Wow! It looks like wings. It's beautiful. Let's all take a picture together. Nagisa, don't run so fast. Hurry up, you two! Yes, Haru. Where am I? Where's Sosuke? He went to go buy drinks a while ago. Oh boy. Did he get lost again? I'll go look for him. Go, Ikuya! Kirishima! Go, Ikuya! What? Who is that? Is that so? Good job! How was your time? You haven't hit the wall? No, I'm doing well. My strokes are longer. In fact, I can't feel the wall. How reassuring. But Kinjou from Sudahigashi, and Terashima from Omori Gakuin are also shortening their time. Wasn't it a tough race? Don't worry, brother. I won't... lose to anyone. Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
