Hi, Mom it's Josh. Obviously, got your message. Just been practicing. I know, surprise, right? Um, anyway, the piece is really shaping up. Can't wait to play it for you. I can't really get there before morning, so hopefully it can wait. Um, okay, see you for breakfast. Love you. - Good morning, Charlotte. - Morning. - Where are you going now? - Just going. - You're always going. - What can I say? I'm busy. Happy birthday, Grandma. - Coconut chocolate? - Of course. Oh! When are you going to sit down and practice? You're welcome. Thank you, dear. When are you going to practice? January. Show me your hands. These fingers have not touched the piano. - All up here. - Oh! All up here. Internet is ruining your work ethic, everything is too easy. It is Grandma, especially that pest, YouTube, filling our brains with infinite amounts of information. I'm surprised you have any brain left at all. Grandma, why are you on my case? Got it, I promise. Go, prove it to me. It's tomorrow, yes? Whatever happens, happens. Up against some tough pianists. That's never stopped you before. Back in my day, we just made music. We didn't have to compete to earn a living for ourselves. I know, I know. "Competition's are for horses not artists." - Who said that? - Your grandpa. But Bartok said at first, If you are going to have to compete to earn your supper, you've got to commit. You will be up against kids that eat, drink, and sleep with Bach, Beethoven and Horowitz. - Grandma. - Laugh all you want, but I know that Victor Zabov has a new favorite to win. Uh, Jake or Josh or something. A favorite, it's not a horse race. And what do you mean, you heard? My musical school is a hot topic at bridge club? This is serious, believe me. Zabov knows all the tricks. Please, if there was someone of that caliber, - I'd know about him. - You can't just float through this one. I don't think I'm going to compete. Yes you are. And besides, if I'm there too long then who's gonna - take care of you? - You don't worry about me. You just get yourself ready. I've never asked you for anything, but I am asking you to take this one seriously. - Grandma, don't get all- - Charlotte, I've got to know you'll be okay after I die. - Grandma, stop. - I've got to know. I need to know. It's just the competition. We both know that's not true. You remind me of your mother. Naturally gifted, incredibly stubborn. You're going to win that competition tomorrow. And she'd be so proud. Yeah, it was, I'll give you that. - When am I gonna see you? - Oh, gosh, soon. - I'm here. - Yeah? - I'm here. - All right. I'm back. - Mm! - So good to see you. - Good to see you. - It's good to be back. Hey, Josh! Josh, wait up! Josh! What do you want? Just a moment to talk with my son. You're 20 years too late. I know, but I'm back for good, I swear. I'm here for good. I can't deal with this right now. Josh, Josh, stop! Thank you. Thank you. Your mom tells me about the competition. She says every pianist who's won goes on to have lucrative careers. That's exciting. I'm proud of you. Hey, you know, it would mean a lot to me if you'd come by. It's no big London competition, but it's a start. For me to be here for good. You would name an entire gallery after yourself. Good morning, Barbara. How you doing, you look well today. Uh, thank you, your mom's in the kitchen. Thanks. Ew, boy, when was the last time you showered? You can't keep a schedule like this without getting sick. You need sleep and food that doesn't come from a paper bag. Why do you give him the time of day? How did he even know where to find you? - Josh. - And you're okay with that? You can just pick up right where you left off whenever he feels like showing up? There are things you don't understand yet. And I don't like what's been happening to you. You're in the practice room day and night. It's not healthy. Look at you, how many hours a week are you working now? I do it for you. I'm going to make things better for you. He's your father, you need him. I forgot, look what I have. And it's not your job to take care of me. Mom. A real Broadway show! Uh, touring, but yeah. People change, Josh. Take Barbara, you know, it'll be fun. You're coming, right? I have to work tonight. Not to his thing, tomorrow, the competition. - I have to work, sweetie. - Okay, my point exactly. I don't like how much you're working lately. I keep telling you, I could get a job. It might be nice change. We're not gonna get into this again. Getting through school is your job, putting you through school is mine. So many rich people go to that school. And maybe I could find you some new clients, you know? One of them would equal three Barbaras. Watch your mouth! Those people don't need me, the Barbaras of the world do. I'm going to win for us. Come say hi to Barbara. Mm, I need to get back to practice. Boy, you better get in there and say hello. So I understand you're leaving us. Hope so, especially now. Well, you win and you get to see the whole world. And take your mom with you. Yes, that's the point. Stop, both of you. If I win, you're coming with me. Otherwise, all my hard work will have been for nothing. Am I doing mom-guilt properly? Yes, very well done. Hmm. Did you see your father earlier? Barbara, how did you know that was Josh's father? I'm old, not dumb. They are the spitting image of one another. Yeah, well looks are all we have in common. Josh! Take a shower and go to bed. All right, peace and blessings. - Bye, Barbara. - Good luck, Maestro. Is it too much to ask that one of you will be at the piano when class begins? A little enthusiasm, people. Beatrice, Beatrice. Let's hear your Beethoven. Yes, Mr. Dempster, yes, sir. I think we've heard enough. You all have smartphones, right? I've been reading about apps lately. I've heard they have one were you can keep track of how many hours you practice. Um, would anyone like to volunteer to help me download an app? You, sir. You can leave now. You seem so much more enthusiastic about this technology than you do the music. I'm serious! I don't have room in this class for dilettantes! If any of the rest of you would rather play with your phones, you're free to go with him! I don't care if you know how to download an app! Just like I don't care if you have rehearsals scheduled or classwork to do. And I particularly don't care, if you have a social life! You're all here for one thing, the music! Oh, and for those of you that have been chosen for the final round of the competition, the only thing you'll be doing between now and tomorrow is practicing! You've never experienced this kind of competition with these kinds of stakes! Nerves will take over! London Prize only comes around once every five years. So you won't get another shot! Josh, you're next. You think you're expressing innocence, but it's not working. You need to play this piece from the viewpoint of an old man, as though he's remembering his youth. Listen to yourself, dig deep. Let me hear you as if you were 70, understand? Now, go practice, you all know what you need to do. It's been years to this point, folks. And now it's tomorrow night. If you've made it this far, you have what it takes to win. Although I'm starting to wonder if it's all a fluke. Come on. So now we're supposed to play from the point of view of an old man. Sometimes I wonder if we're in a music school or is this a real acting school. Charlotte. And you're the Josh I've been hearing about. Don't worry, it's okay. Uh, I don't know who you've been talking to. Well Zabov is crazy about you, that's obvious. You look like you could use a break. Wanna hang out, get out for a while? Did you hear him? I can't go anywhere, shouldn't you be practicing too? Even if you're not in the competition, like Zabov expects it. Consider that a tip from one of his most abused students. So you practice because he tells you? I practice because I wanna win the competition. I wanna have a career. So are you coming with me? You know, I could help you. - Help me? - Yes. Tell you what, why not play hooky for this afternoon? Or are you afraid Zabov will catch you? You know how crazy things get around here before a competition. That's called practicing. You see a guy standing on his head while he practices, you know you've been here for too long. What guy? You know when you see him, and when you do, you know it's time to get out of here. Well, if you change your mind, I'll be around. You know, you're not going to find what it means - in the practice room. - And what exactly... It's way too tethered, do you understand? Ah, Joshua Irving. A word, please. What happened in class today? You seemed distracted. Nerves, I guess. If you win this competition, you'll be in demand. They won't all be big concerts, but concerts, nonetheless, college towns, small cities. Did you know that there are people who don't want to see you in this competition, Joshua? You have to want it. I gave up everything important for my career. Are you ready to do that? And you've got to work twice as hard because of who you are. Here you go. Two totally different interpretations of your Beethoven. Listen, get some ideas. Hey oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had a student in here. I'll come back. No, no, we're winding up right now. This is Josh. He's in the finals tomorrow. That's quite an honor, what piece have you chosen? - Uh, "Pathetique." - Really? Well that's quite an intense piece for a man so young. He handles it like a man beyond his years. You'll never get another chance like the one you have tomorrow. Victor, will I see you tonight? Ah, crowds aren't my thing. Uh, thanks for these. Josh, you may think I'm harsh, but out there are people who will judge you harshly based on everything from your technique to your skin color. You've got to be flawless. You've got to play so that they have no excuse not to hire you. Do you understand? All right. Dude, get out! Hey, Mom, Um, I know you're at work. I'm just here practicing, probably for a few more hours and then I'm gonna head home early. So call me if you need anything. Hey, your mom gave me your number. Uh, said I should call. You know how convincing she can be. Anyway I'm really hoping you'll come to the opening tonight. It would mean a lot to me. I just wanna share this with you. Saw him? Yeah, it's something like that. I just needed a break. What's with the balloons? They're for my niece. You know, when I asked you to hang out for a while, I mean, it was longer than just a break. I have to be somewhere now. And we're gonna be there a while. Why me? Why not? Coming or not? You got a car? Happy birthday, Amy. Kazoos, thanks, Aunt Char. Who are you, are you my aunt's boyfriend? Daddy, who's that man? Well, I hope for his sake, the balloon delivery man. - Daddy, you silly. - Yeah. Cute, yours? So how did my sister rope you into this? I volunteered. Huh, that's what he thinks. Uh, take this. Um, I'm sorry I don't have a present. Oh no worries. All the presents are donations for the local animal shelter, anyway. - Amy insisted. - She's a weird child. Laney. All right, well, I guess we'll cover this later. - Okay. - Sorry. - What is she up to? - Oh, give 'em a break. - They're a cute couple. - It's not so fun when it's your party, is it? Ah, could you go get the cake, please. Uh, go sit over there, come on. I'm Bryn, by the way. Oh, sorry, Josh. And you've met Laney, our neighbor's daughter. But she's here so much, she's like family. And inside's my husband Milo. So how long have you known my sister? Oh, we just... Not long. And do you play piano? Yeah, actually, apparently we're at the same conservatory. "Apparently." We have a family full of musicians. Um, Amy is just starting to take lessons, and Milo plays cello. Though, not so much anymore. Um, are you competing tomorrow in the London com... You like our song, Amy and I are gonna start a band. - Oh. - The Kazoo Keepers. You get it, you get it? It's very cute. So is Josh coming tonight? Is that within our schedule? Well, I have to go practice, actually. So I don't think that's gonna happen. Oh, you could take a page out of his book, huh? See, Charlotte's so naturally gifted, she takes things like practicing. - We have to go. - For granted. Look at that. - Here you go. - Oh. But we haven't had cake yet. Poor kid. Cake! So where can I drop you? We had an understanding. You said you wouldn't weird out on me. - Don't do that. - Do what? You say like I said something I didn't. Well, we're here now and it's still early and I know you want to be alone and this competition is a big deal to you, but I'm gonna be late if I don't go now and it's on the way back to school and I promise we're gonna go right back to school and I'll be out of your hair. It's on the way? Okay. - This my friend Josh. - Woo! Right, rock stars, button it up. Wanna show Josh what we worked on? - Yeah! - Yeah. One, two. Woo, yeah! - Way to go! - Yeah! You composed that? I mean, then they busted out with that rock riff. I don't even understand where that comes from. Like how, what made you put that with jazz? I put things I like. Um, like what kind of music do you listen to? - What do you mean? - What's on your playlist? I don't know, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart. What, what's on yours? Led Zeppelin, John Coltrane, Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift? You can't live in the world doing the same thing over and over and expect to be inspired. Besides, Taytay knows how to get the party started. So why classical? What do you mean? Why are you studying classical music, why did you pick it? I don't know, I... It picked me, I guess. I mean, I was around age six when I started taking lessons. And it came easy in a way. You know, my anger just seemed to flow right into the music. Why were you angry at six? Um, so what's the deal with you and those kids anyway? Like, are you like a teacher? I volunteer there once a week. Music helped me when I was a kid. Figure it was something small I could do to bring back. Besides, it's fun. Speaking of ways to have fun, how's working with Zabov? Huh! How long have you been with him? - Four years. - Oh my God. - Yeah. - Ooh! Wanna hear something funny? Okay. My grandma and Zabov used to have a thing. A thing? And it was serious, apparently. She talks about him all the time, but she would never admit that. I think it's hilarious. It's basically the reason why I avoided studying with him. So how's that going anyway? What, your grandma and Zabov? You and Zabov. He's tough. I need that. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, like discipline. What? We've been in the same school, both about to graduate, and yet I have never ever seen you. You've never been to a single party, to a single school competition or show. I mean, I bet you spent all of your time in a practice room. This little 10 by 10 practice room, doing nothing but practicing all day and eating food delivered to you. I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just some unpleasant problem with discipline. You have me all figured out, huh? Well, you missed the part where I haven't been here all four years. Zabov pulled strings and got me in this year. Apparently, he felt community college was beneath me. Yeah. Tell you what, the $30 classes weren't beneath me. Look, it's your first year at conservatory and you made the finals. - You're gonna win. - Huh. Well, I guess if having no life is winning. So I was right, all of your time in a practice. I have to win. "I have to win." You'd think piano cured cancer or something. You wouldn't understand. It's all anyone talks about. There's more to life than music. Says the girl with the musical family. I wish my family understood what I did. And you know, they try to, but really I'm alone. I'm alone at home, I'm alone in school. So my grandma's having a birthday party tonight. - Wanna come? - The one who's dating Zabov? - Ah, no, thank you. - Ew, no. And that was a million years ago. I can't, I have been out too long as it is. I think you'd really like her. Sounds fun, but you know, discipline. Yeah, yeah, Zoolander. Listen, if you're not ready by now, you will never be ready. Okay, we've wasted enough time, let's go. - What's this? - Whoa. "The Art of Ted Urban Grand Opening, 200, Josh, hope to see you there, Love Dad." Whatever. Back to school, right? Oh, just one more stop on the way, okay? - Where are we? - Oh, here, here. - Stop, stop, stop. - Here? Yeah, yeah, good. You're crazy, there's no one here. - Gotta see this place. - Why? And wouldn't it be better to come back when it's opened or never? Scared? Yeah, I'm scared of being a black guy caught breaking into buildings. What are you doing? No breaking, just entering. Watch your step. What is this death trap? Why are you whispering? This used to be a great concert hall. All the best of the best used to play here. Now they use it as a revival church and not even they can fill the seats. - Yeah, no kidding. - Daniel should be here somewhere. Who's Daniel? He's sort of a caretaker here. Takes care of the place and hooligans coming in. Like us. I know you're up there, I hear you breathing. Come on guys! Daniel. Charlie, chaps, ooh, stand back. Got bats up here, three of 'em. I brought a friend. - Oh, a friend? - Yes. Are you a musician too? The best, he's gonna be a famous concert pianist. A pianist, oh, you gotta see this! Come on! Let's go. Oh, boy, the acoustics are just perfect. It's so sweet. It's a little torn up now, but there's plans for a remodel.

Hey, Charlotte. Late as always, glad you could make it. Hi, come on in. Welcome to the Kraken Factory. We do this thing where we, playing and stuff for each other. Kind of like the guys over Ireland has. Except these are the class clowns. Shut up, I prefer to think of ourselves as open-minded. Welcome to our somewhat famous alt classical enclave. What are you doing? And what are you talking about? Who is he? - Just a friend. - Holy crap. - He's the guy. - No. The guy from the competition tomorrow. The guy that you've been stalking. No, I wasn't stalking him. Are you purposely trying to sabotage the poor kid? I was just curious, don't be weird. Hey, hey, what's been going on with you? I kinda don't wanna do the competition. And I haven't rehearsed like at all. Charlotte, you could win that competition with your eyes closed and your fingers chopped off. This time, it's different. He's really good, like really good. Why do you care about the competition at all? You can just quit. Grandma. I'm sorry, sweetie, you are so screwed. - All right, everyone. - Woo! - Yeah! - Woo! Let's get this thing rolling. Woo! - Woo, all right! - Woo! - Yeah! - All right! - Let's do it again! - Yeah! - Whoo! - Whoo! Goodnight. See you next week. You ready? This is so weird. Why? I don't know, it just is. You just haven't gotten to know it yet. Come. Hmm, come. Are you forgetting something? Crap, grandma! - Hello, beautiful lady. - Oh, Margerie, dear. - How are you? - Wonderful. Happy birthday. Will you be singing for us tonight? Excuse me, dear. Where's Charlotte? Oh, you know, she's always late. Your husband should be here. Well, he had to wait for the sitter. He'll be here soon. I don't need all of this anyway. Oh, it's your birthday, we have to celebrate you. Besides, it's some unwritten law that we have to annoy our family members with cake and presents. Corinna, Corinna! - Oh! - How are you, my sweet? It is so good to see you, happy birthday. I cannot wait to hear you dazzle us on the keys tonight. - Uh. - Bryn, tell her this is her night and she can have whatever she wants. Is everything okay over here? - What he says? - You get whatever you want. Isn't this nice? Beautiful night, great friends. Great music and no more protest. Oh, she's so old. - Grandma. - That is so delicious. I dare you to throw it out. Someone I want you to meet. Oh! This is my friend Josh. Oh, yes, Josh the pianist. Uh, happy to meet you, ma'am. Please, ma'am is not necessary. So you are a Victor Zabov's new student. The next one in line for all the accolades, yes? I'm surprised he let you out tonight. He usually keeps very close guard on all his musicians. Hothouse musicians, we used to call them. So this is Charlie's idea, I presume. Gotta hand it to the girl. She's a wily one. It's my birthday. And I want to hear my granddaughter play. Hmm, I'm not getting up there. Why not? Okay, I'll tell you what if that bartender does a cartwheel before she gets back to the bar, you'll get up on that stage. Wait for it, wait for it. It's gonna happen. It did not happen, okay. I'll tell you what. Go up there, I go up there. Oh, please. The silly arguing, both of you, you're musicians, yes? Get up on that stage and play. You know what? Push. Yeah. Bravo, oh, bravo. Come on Mr. Beethoven. Put your fingers on the keys and wiggle them. Bravo! Yes! - Did that just happen? - Yes, it did. That was unreal. Not too shabby, Mr. Beethoven. That's my roommate's girlfriend calls me. She said it's 'cause I'm a slob like Beethoven. Oh, really? You look like a young Denzel Washington when you laugh. "We didn't land on Plymouth Rock! Plymouth Rock landed on us!" It's Denzel. As it's Malcolm X. - Is that a movie? - Oh, Charlotte. No, no, no. I've seen every Denzel movie at least six times. And not just because he's hot. - I... - What is it? I, I'm sorry. - Did I... - No. - Should I not have? - No. I'm not good at this. It's me, I shouldn't have kept you out so long. You have an important day tomorrow and you should go. Yeah, actually, yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, uh. - Yes. - Um, okay. I'll just go grab a water. - Sure, yes. - For the long bus ride home. Really been a rough night in there. - Thank you. - You know, heroes. Mm. Are you out here fake smoking again? Some show, huh? Well maybe we should go easier on her, she is only 20. Old enough to know what she's doing. You see it, right? She's doing the same thing to that kid. You know what, maybe this time it'll be different. People don't change. Are you forgetting that maybe if things hadn't happened that way we wouldn't have happened? Another drink, we got a sitter. Certainly that's cause for celebration. Ah, two waters please. - You bet. - Thank you. There he is, man of the hour. That's nice playing. Thank you, thanks. Did you ever do the Beethoven cello sonatas? No, but I'd love to. - Mm. - Anything else, gentlemen? - No, we're okay. - What are we drinking? Yours truly did many years ago at the conservatory. My accompanist was just a kid. What was that like? Humiliating! Aren't you gonna ask me why? - Uh. - We just started the first movement and she took off like a bat out of hell, Just ramrodded through the whole thing. Just pure ego. She was a real piece of work, that one. I got slammed by the papers, but the kid, she gets rave reviews, they loved her. They just can't wait to see your next appearance. She was just a kid, right? I'm sure she didn't mean to, you know, sabotage... Just watch yourself. And what you see is not what you get. We will have no crying in our beers - at this party, thank you. - Mm. Oh, and they just put out scallops wrapped in bacon. Speaking my language. Here is to Beethoven ala bacon. Mm, this vodka's gone bad. Taste like water. Uh, yeah, excuse him. Yeah, it's okay. Um, nice performance earlier. I didn't expect that, I thought you were strictly classical. Well, tonight's been different. This whole day has. Are your parents coming? I'd love to meet the people who raised that one. Oh, I'm sorry, did I say something wrong? No, no, it's okay. Um, they're no longer with us. There was a car accident. I don't think Charlie even remembers them. She never talks about them. I'm sorry. Now she's the only one who ever really got Charlie. - Your grandmother? - Yeah. I mean, when Mom and Dad passed, I was already pretty much out of the house and Charlie was still a toddler. Well that explains the accent. Oh, yeah. Well, and Grandma raised Charlie, but I think she picked up the accent on purpose to be closer to her. She's pretty great. On the piano. On the piano, yeah. Look, Josh, I know it's none of my business, but that London competition. Uh, don't remind me. My teacher would yank me from the competition - if he knew I was here. - So you do know that... - No, ooh, hi. - Mm. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, well we'll talk later. - Okay. - Come, you. - All right. - Let's, let's, let's... He's a good guy. Hello everyone, hi, um... Can I get two more waters, please, sorry. I would like to thank our guest of honor. And thank you all for coming. Our guest of honor is Grandma Corinna. I think as a thank you gift for us, for her birthday, she should sing us or play us something. - Yes! - Yes, yes! Yes! Those among the crowd, come on, some cheering! Yes, yes, yes!

I must know a hundred melodies, but the last few years I've been playing the same ones over and over. I sit at the piano and it's the same melodies all the time. I don't know if I was trying to perfect them or if I'm just a creature of habit, but then my hands couldn't stretch as far. And then it became difficult to play at all. And it's hard to admit that even here on my, hmm, birthday. When you love something and then one day it's gone, you realize that maybe it's good that you decided to have a life outside the music, but I have no regrets. I have lived fully. And I have loved fully. And now my Charlie is going to take over in my footsteps and make her grandma so proud. Congratulations to Charlotte and wish her well for her big competition tomorrow. I thought you left without saying goodbye. Why is he here? I think it's because of grandma. No, no, you said they weren't a thing. - They're not. - Okay, I have to leave before he sees me here, but my bag is inside, my bike is out front, what am I supposed... There's something else. What, what else? Josh, I need to tell you something. What, what, Charlotte, what? There you are, missy. I don't appreciate you forcing me up on that stage. And you, where are you off to in such a hurry? I have to go. Zabov is gonna pull me from the competition if he sees me here. That's absolutely correct. Victor Zabov, nothing has changed. You're still an ass. That's crass, Corinna. If you don't let your musicians live a little, how are they going to bring any life into their music? He's a good teacher, Corinna, he's just trying- - I can handle my own battles, Josh. Oh, you said something he has always been able to handle. His battles. Let me take you home, I have a car waiting. Why? So you can lock me in a room like you do your musicians? Not letting them live their lives. I do that for their own good. Joshua wouldn't have gotten this far, if it wasn't for strict discipline. And now he's playing for one of the greatest - competitions in the- - Oh, posh! It doesn't matter who you're playing for or what you're playing. A musician has to connect with his audience. I don't care if you play every single note perfectly. If you don't have anything to say, don't waste my time. And you, what you did in there tonight, now that was something special. - Oh, oh! - Grandma! Corinna, are you all right? I told you I was gonna take you home. Now I'll take you to the hospital. Lift her up. - Josh, grab my purse. - Hold her, hold her. Come on, go ahead, go. Go, go, go. Amy is sound asleep. I don't think she missed us one bit. Gosh, seeing those kids tonight reminded me of how I used to be with us. When was the last time we were all goofy and playful like that? Baby, hey, it happened, it's over. Besides, she's not the reason you stopped playing, remember? Come on, why did you stop playing? Because I quit auditioning. Why? 'Cause that curmudgeon conductor said my bow work looked like a hippo with arthritis. Oh, come on, why? 'Cause I was losing my soul. And it became about winning. Do you regret our life together? What, no. No, I love our life. You're right. I love you. Remember when it used to be fun? No! Yes, come on, play with me. - No! - Come on! - No, no, no. - Come on. No, no, please, turn it off. No. - Play with me. - No. ♪ Some days it seems ♪ ♪ We can't agree ♪ ♪ And our duet's gone out of key ♪ ♪ I wonder if this love's passe ♪ Mm. ♪ But then you croon a note or two ♪ ♪ And soon my will to fight is through ♪ ♪ You sing my doubts and fears away ♪ ♪ Your smooth vivacious voice ♪ ♪ Leaves me without a choice ♪ ♪ And drives you right back to my arms ♪ ♪ You're like a tidal wave ♪ ♪ That washes me along ♪ ♪ I'm a prisoner of your siren song ♪ ♪ Yes your siren song ♪ Don't be silly, I'm not dying. Let's get you to bed. I still think she should see a doctor. She needs an x-ray. I'll call first thing in morning. Stop, all of you! Can't an old woman have some peace? So last time something like this happened, the doctor said it might have been a mini-stroke. He said it could come up again with no warning, but she keeps saying this was nothing. She'll go to the doctor tomorrow if I have to take her myself. Stubborn woman. What I want to know is what's going on between you two? Don't you care for your careers, your music? I have been studying non-stop. - I convinced him to go. - For four weeks. - It wasn't even his idea. - This is the first night - I left, okay? - And he was practicing. - I'm sorry. - And I was helping him. - I messed up. - Silence! Josh, I am disappointed. You actually had what it takes to win. And then you go and do something stupid like this. Did you really think the way to win was to sabotage another competitor? Wait, what? If you just worked as hard seated at your piano as you do distracting Josh, you'd have been the sure winner. And you, after our talk today, I don't understand this behavior. I put too much faith in you. Now go, both of you. Get out of here! I'll stay here for Corinna. Why won't you unlock? Josh, please, I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you. When, like when did you try to tell me, Charlotte? When you, when you made me think that I was somehow special and you wanted to hang out with me? When you, when you used me as your escort around town all day? - Like when? - You can still win. Oh my God, how long have you been in the competition? And you're one of the finalists? Josh, please, you can still win. So was that your plan all along? To, to distract me, right? Like throw me off my game. - Was that your plan? - Yes. - Yes, at first, but- - And the girl Milo told me about that stole his moment, that was you. I didn't want to believe it, that this girl that I... - That you what? - Forget... - What, Josh? - It doesn't matter. Okay, not anymore. Dammit, Charlotte, you put my entire life in jeopardy. Everything I've worked for! Runner-up gets nothing, okay? If I don't win this, then all the lessons, all the money that my mom put in to pay for those lessons, for nothing! Because it isn't about winning. Do you really wanna go there right now? I'm sorry, it's just, everyone was talking about how perfect your technique was, how you were everyone's favorite. Because I spend my life in a practice room! I have done nothing but work to get to this moment! You could have done the same thing instead of... You couldn't even tell me you were in the finals. Do you really think that would have changed anything? Maybe, I just... - Josh, please. - Stop, stop it! Charlotte, just leave me alone. Okay, this day was a mistake. My life, my plans, everything's all jacked up! You have no idea what it's like for me here at this white-ass school! You think people are clamoring to hire people like me? People like you, but you're so talented. I can't make a single mistake. Not one, you have no idea what that's like. Yes, I do, I'm a woman. It's not the same! Like you saying that just proves you don't know what you're talking about. You just, you just coast through, not taking anything seriously, just... And somehow you got into the finals of one of the most prestigious competitions in the worst! Why is everyone making such a big deal out of it? Everyone's gonna know who's Beethoven in a hundred years, will they know who Josh Irving is? Oh, shit, Josh, I didn't mean it like that. Josh! No, I'm sorry, I meant all of us. You are not the person I thought you were. Neither are you. You act like everyone is abandoning you, but you're the one who choose all of this. You choose to spend your life in a practice room. You choose to think that you're somehow different so you couldn't have any friends. And you choose to think that you have to be perfect to have a career. I don't know what the thing with your father is, but at least you have one. - What about your bike? - I'll take the bus! I'd never seen her happier, hmm. Mm, you were her whole world. You were the light of her life, man. After you were born, she didn't need anything. Not her art, not me. You were hardly there. You don't know what she needed. I know, and I'm sorry. You know, this photograph, this photograph is the thing that got me painting again. Deepened my love for art. Your mom and I had just come from a little flea market and I bought her a used Roller-flex. And I snapped that on the fly. And later that night, she told me she was pregnant with you. Why are you here? Why are you suddenly hellbound on staying? I had an opportunity, I had to leave. I'm not saying it's right, but it was what I felt I had to do. But looking back, all the traveling, all the places, all the running around, trying to get the perfect shot, the perfect sunset. I would trade all that in a heartbeat to get back the moments I lost with you and your mom. I didn't know it then, but I do now. And I'm gonna prove it to you. Like tonight, this competition, whatever happens, I'm gonna be here for you. If moving mom away, is what you and she wants, then I'll go wherever you go, 'cause it's not about where I am anymore, about where you are. And I'm gonna prove that to you. If you knew how hard mom worked all these years while you were out living it up. All pompous with your travel log photos and drinking wine with these pretentious idiots who think you're some kind of genius! And then you come here and pretend to be interested in what I'm doing every couple of years. You have no idea what it's like. You don't care about me or my music or about my goals to move mom away from here. It's all about you! Still. Hey grandma, shouldn't you be at the doctors? I'm back, I'm fine. I told you. Where is Zabov? He went to buy some groceries to make lunch. Stubborn old fool. What you did last night- - I know, I'm sorry. What you did was wrong. You're better than that. But I take some fault. I pressed you too hard to win. No, Grandma, it's not... I forgot what it's like to be young. Have a life of opportunity in front of you. In love. I'm not in love. You are so head over heels, you can't walk unless you're doing a handstand. I was so worried about your future. I could only see that competition. It was the love of the music, not the fame, not the money. It was always the music. When I watched you and Josh up there last night, a new fire got lit in this old dusty heart of mine. Oh, I haven't felt that since- - Grandpa? No, before. Do ever regret not taking a chance? I'll meet you in the kitchen. Sometimes, but then I wouldn't have you or your sister. You have to figure out what it is you want, not what the rest of us want. Everyone is just trying to figure out their own shit. Grandma! Yes, your grandma curses on occasion too. Practice, don't practice. I'm going to get myself some lunch. I would've stayed. I know. That's why I left. Hey, package for Josh Irving. - Yeah, that's me. - All right. Just sign here, please. - You have a good day. - Thanks, you too. Okay. You, I saw you at the piano bar. That was magnificent, young man. The caliber of your talent is gonna put you on the world stage. I look forward to what your future holds. And look at that face, the full package. Fabulous. You're ready. You're ready. Confidence. Saturday is gone, take a deep breath. Deep breaths. Now, once you perform, you come backstage and wait. The results will be announced immediately following the competition. So Beatrice, you're up. - Good luck. - Thanks. You too. I'm glad to see you've come to your senses. Potassium for the nerves, smart boy. - Victor. - Corinna. Hmm. I just wanted to tell you good luck tonight. You are a stellar pianist. And just remember, play from your heart. Hmm? - May I help you off? - Certainly. Why do you play, Josh? I, because... 'Cause why? Do you love it? I've taught you everything I can. Now it's up to you to do what's in your heart. Trust your instincts. Don't let any moment get away. Now that we got that over with. Once upon a time, a young Beethoven got to play for his idol, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, in the hope that he would get to study under him. Uh, the story goes that Mozart had no interest in being interrupted by something so frivolous and was even colder when Beethoven played a studied piece of Mozart's. Beethoven begged for another chance. Mozart played a tune that the young composer could never have possibly heard. Beethoven then went on to improvise on that tune. Rumor has it that after Beethoven played, Mozart said, "Look out for that boy. One day he'll give the world something to talk about." Beethoven never went on to study under Mozart, but he became beloved all on his own, doing his own thing. Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to try my own thing, inspired by Beethoven and a few new friends. For you tonight. Sorry, Grandma, my heart's not in it. But everything will be fine, promise.

We handed them out to everyone in town. This place is gonna be packed! You're gonna make so much money. Charlotte, hey. Hey. We're gonna go home and get our stuff and shower. Back to rehearse, you know, in like an hour? Yeah, yeah, that's perfect. I'll be done with the choir by then. How did you know where to find me? The other kids are great at music, awful with secrets. It's wonderful what you do for those kids in the church. I don't get it. You got everything you want, why are you still here? You don't know what I wanted, you quit. I left you a note. Well, at least you have it, that's something. I haven't read it. I just wanted to tell you that I... Ooh, the great Charlotte lost for words, Hmm, I guess there's a first time for everything, huh? When I was watching you play, you really loved it. But I don't feel that. I feel like when I'm playing with all the kids. I feel like when I'm playing with a gig on the toy piano. And I feel it with you. The performance, the competition, you were amazing. And my grandma couldn't stop talking about you. She told me that the judges were arguing for hours. Is it true? Okay, yes, all right, uh... I just wanted to say that I'm I'm sorry for messing up your life, for ruining it and I'm just sorry. I didn't care why you quit the competition. I cared why you quit on me. You left after all of that. And you say you feel all of that, but you you walked away. I know I messed up, but I can't take it back. I was alone. Again. I didn't stay for you, because of you or whatever. I know. I stayed for me. This is where I wanna be. I would just prefer you here with me.
