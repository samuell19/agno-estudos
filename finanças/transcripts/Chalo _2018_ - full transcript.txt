Come, cross the line. The threshold of your heart. Come, cross the line. The chaos of time. Come, cross the line. And hold my hand. Come, cross the line. You can do it if you want to. In this darkness, Come, cross the line. The morn won't come. But I will. In midst of this chaos. Come, cross the line. In midst of this confusion. The one to come. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. Cross the line. '211 up, Siliguri local will be arriving..' '..at 9: 15 on platform no.7.' Come on, come on. Carefully, there are bottles in it. What did you say? That you'll provide separate cars to everybody. Tata Sumo, Tavera, Scorpio.. ..and all sorts of tall promises you made. Why didn't you own up in the beginning.. ..that you'll be taking everyone in a bus? Look, actually.. there's a system.. ..there's a push back system available in the seats. Now he's showing me push back systems. I mean we've made all arrangements. Drinking water, an hourly stoppage for toilets.. What toilets are you showing me? - Make sure it doesn't fall. You never mentioned a bus while taking the advance. No, no. Actually, I mean, we'll adjust the money. What adjustment do you wish to make? I'm not here to adjust or advance with anything. Do you understand? I had told you a zillion times.. .. that I can't sleep on the upper berth. Did I or didn't I? How did that help me anyways? I'm repeating myself. I don't get into a bus if I don't have a window seat. May I say something? - No. Please, listen to me patiently. Look, this is our first trip. So, you might face a few inconveniences. Wow! Bravo! - Please try and adjust. Do you have to fail an exam.. ..just because you're taking it for the first time? No, I didn't mean that. You all are pathetic. This is why you all don't stand anywhere. Who all? Bengalis, who else? Look, I'm repeating again.. At the end of this road. You're sitting here humming songs? Look, there are responsible people fighting out there. Go, join them! Ms. Ganguly has taken the window seat ahead. That's why I captured this one, for you. Don't you want to sit here? - No. Go, get Bubai's bag from the top. I've kept your jacket and my cardigan in it. Go right now. Humming away to glory! - Has all the luggage been loaded? Excuse me, so you're not taking this window seat, right? Yes, I am. Where have you kept my black bag? On top or at the bottom? At the bottom. - Why did you keep it at the bottom? There's fragile stuff in there. I mean.. I mean.. It'll stay tight and compact at the bottom. Brother, you'll have to hand me.. ..that red, flat bag of mine. Why? What happened? My wife wants it, not me. - Sorry, I can't give it to you. It's all packed and done. Now, I can't. Hey, listen. What do you think? Don't you forget, we are your clients. Okay? So what? I don't slog free of cost. It's not the question of slogging free of cost. Just a minute. Just a minute. Please don't get angry. My red bag.. 'This is Shekhar's drawback.' - The bag.. 'He loses his temper at the drop of the hat.' Because of this habit, he quarrelled with his father..' '..and left his huge ancestral home in Manicktala.' Come on, fetch it. - 'The reason.. Grandpa, you go up and fetch it. - He wanted to form a Bengali band.' Come, cross the line. In the clash of faiths. Come cross the line. And forget all differences. Come, cross the line. Irrespective of depths. There are no boundaries. Ashim played the drums whenever he could manage..' '..to find time from practicing medicine.' Where there's no end. 'Shekhar played the base guitar.' 'Hari was our vocalist..' ..and I did vocals as well as composed music for us.' 'Our band was called 'Achieving Moksha.' 'God knows what we achieved.' Although once, while doing a show in Kuch Behar..' ..we certainly achieved the feat of being brutally thrashed.' Hey. Hey, stop it. Stop it you morons! Hey, what's the matter? - I'll finish you. Hey, hey. What's the matter? - I'll kill you all. Why are you getting violent? - Dare you spread this cheap culture! You don't lose your temper. No. Hey, what are you doing? Please, no violence. I'll neither practice medicine.. ..nor sing Bengali songs ever again in life. What else do plan to do? Take a look around. What? Look around yourself. There are so many mind blowing places in the world.. ..and yet we aim to make money.. ..by composing music for a cheap Bengali band. What do you wish to do with these places? Sell them off. You're not keeping a word of what you had committed.' 'Sir, the first experience always comes with risks.' 'just imagine, if it was a corporate tour operator..' '..instead of us, you couldn't have argued like this.' 'There's enough reason to argue.' What are we gaining out of this fight? It's bringing us closer. And that's our main aim. Personalised tourism. We all are travelling like friends.. ..or neighbours out on a picnic. Staying together, eating together.. ..and even bickering together over our petty ego issues. And that's why, our company is called.. ..'At Home Travels.' Excuse me, what's your exact point? That you are absolutely inexperienced, right? You don't need to tell us that. There's enough proof already. My point is that when you've already set off.. ..what's the point in cribbing? Rather, let's set all these petty complaints aside.. ..and picnic hard for the next five days and four nights. Yes, please. I'm not here for a picnic. - Again? When did he say that? Do you get what he's saying? At least I can't. - No, no. I mean.. Please, I think we're going around in circles. These boys are admitting that this is their first endeavour.. ..and they need our help. Exactly! - But Mr. Ashim, there's one thing. I've repeated many times that I don't have sugar.. ..and yet you've been continuously serving.. ..sugared tea on the bus. There are so many seats here.. so many empty seats.. In some of them, the springs don't work. My recliner doesn't work, my wife's window can't be shut. Yes, that means.. - You have to be much more organised. Exactly. - My dear, all you need is pen and paper.. ..and you can just jot everything down. Yes, I got you. - In fact, do it now. What say? - Silence. We should tell them our requirements.. ..or preferences one by one. Why don't you start with Mrs. Ganguly? Miss. I beg your pardon? It's not Mrs. It's Miss. Miss Ganguly. Oh, sorry. - Will you please shut up? Please stop! What happened? Why did they stop now? What happened, Driver? Why did you stop? How long would it halt? Now that the bus has stopped, I must get down. What is it, Hari? Will you tell me what the matter is? Are you going to stop every few minutes.. ..and pick up passengers like this? Is that at home too? - Please don't yell. Where did that gentleman go? The one wearing the specs with a black frame? Sugar. - What? Sugar. Please note it down. No sugar in tea. Not mine but I'll step in now. Look, I don't understand your 'at home' punch line. Do you remember my conditions? For breakfast, no omelets, no poach. Only boiled eggs. Fresh towels in the room.. ..and a mountain view from the window. Okay? Hey you! Come back! - That's okay. Yes, but are we picking up the boy? Times are not good. You shouldn't pick up anybody just like that. The boy's name is Riya. - What? 'Hari.' 'He could never pass out of college.' Every time he sees a woman, his clothes lose continuity.' 'Ashim, our leader.' 'He qualified as a doctor with flying colours..' ..but has no interest in medicine.' - Could we exchange our seats? 'Shekhar.' 'His father owns a huge umbrella showroom..' ..at Harrison Road but he spends time betting on races.' 'And myself.' 'I got a good job as journalist but didn't like it.' 'Ashim, Shekhar, Hari and myself, Sanjay.' 'We all went to the same school.' 'Ashim was two years our senior.' 'Ashim went to study medicine at NRS.' 'Shekhar got thrown out of school.' 'Hari and I got into Ashutosh College.' Shut up! - 'But our friendship survived.' 'First, an event management company..' ..and then a band, neither of which worked out.' This Tours and Travels company was Ashim's idea.' I don't understand a thing. You've come up with such a business plan.. ..which none of us have any idea about. Do you always think over everything you do? Of course. I do. You fell in love five times.. ..and fell flat on your face every single time. Right? Now this is getting personal, boss. What's about this business? Isn't that personal? How can you bring in the personal element in business? It'll be our selling point. We'll personally guide our clients on the tours. You're talking about conducted tours, right? There are loads of them. Go to Dharmatala and see for yourself. They're all sitting idle. You stop betting on races. Go back to your father and apologise to him. You belong to your family, go back there. Then coax Rs.50,000 out of your father.. ..and leave the rest to me. Hey, listen. I'll do anything but apologise to my father. Why? What has uncle done? You never cared to pay attention to your studies. Even at this age.. ..he's looking after the huge umbrella business all alone. You'll bet on races and sit around like a lump of bread.. ..and you expect him to accept that? Hey, do you even know my father? I know him better than you do. Go, go. Go, apologise. He'll surely forgive you. If you dive at his feet, he'll surely give you the money. Even if his father gives us Rs.50,000.. ..the question is, what do we do with the money? You all light the candles and I'll cut the cake. We didn't have to borrow money from Shekhar's father. Ashim arranged for it. After that, we roped in a handful of Bengali clients.. ..and set off on our journey. North Bengal. Our first destination was Gorumara. After that Kalimpong and lastly Darjeeling. Here, have tea. Thanks. Isn't Ms. Grouchy having tea? - Who? Ms. Grouchy? Where's Mr. Ashim? Mr. Ashim! Ms. Ganguly. - Mr. Ashim! No, she doesn't have tea. What do you think? Is she a terrorist or a feminist? Why would she be a terrorist? Ever since she got into the bus.. ..she's not budged from her place even once. She might as well be a human bomb. You think she's a human bomb? She's certainly a bomb but how human or inhuman.. ..can be made out only after some time has passed. What exactly do you do? Madam Crackerology. What? Baby, could you take a photograph please? Sure, Darling. Why not? You ponder over it, while I take Mamoni's photograph. Come fast, the sun is going down! Here I come, darling. - Shut up. Don't talk too much. Look proper if the cap is in there. Hey, listen. I just discovered something amazing. What? - Listen. - What is it? - Extraordinary. Humungous sweets from the hills. Will you have some? You've already eaten your share haven't you? No, I just saw them. Won't you have some? Wear your monkey cap. If you catch a cold, I'll have to suffer the consequence. You look for it. Have you told uncle Shibu.. ..that we've boarded the bus? I'll do it right now. - You still haven't? Where will you find Uncle now? He must be in office. Go call Nepla's mother.. ..and ask her to send father a message. He's impossible! - Here's your cap. Give it to me. Hey, this.. No, no, no. No. We wanted three double rooms and three single rooms. I had myself called. What? What? You take off your cap and hold it in your hand. Okay, you wear this. Check out the paraphernalia after a single photograph. Maybe they stay abroad and don't visit this side very often. No, no. It's nothing but a bad habit. The Japanese are no different. They go on taking photographs. They barely see anything with their eyes. Hello, no enlightenment. That's why this race will never get anywhere. Who, the Japanese? No, the Bengalis. The Japanese are still disciplined. But the Bengalis, neither discipline, nor enlightenment. A whole community gone to the doldrums.. ..just because of their tall talks. So you mean no Bengali has ever spoken sense? No, we're all tall talkers. We quote Tagore, Vivekananda, and Vidyasagar.. ..at the drop of a hat. Here, Mr. Ashim. You said we'll take two hours. It's already been three hours. The driver says it'll take another hour. How long will it actually take to reach there? Should I tell you something? Yes, tell me. Travelling doesn't mean just reaching your destination. It's the journey, the sight seeing.. No, I can't see anything. Please go and try sitting on the last seat. The jerking doesn't allow you to see anything. Okay, you can take my seat? Beside Ms. Grouchy? - Yes. Not at all. Then go and sit next to Hari. The girl must've got down by now. Are you waiting for someone? Who told you? Naturally. The bus is ready to go. Will you.. stay? My phone is not working and I want to call home. Mine is working. Hari, listen. What happened? The hotel. - What does that mean? There's a goof up. - What's the matter? Two double rooms and one single room. What are you saying? What do you think I'm saying? Come on, I need to talk to you. Wait. The girl is stranded. Are you getting hooked on? Come on. No, no. That's not possible. Excuse me, listen. Excuse me, I'm talking to you. Yes, please tell me. - How could you even think.. ..that I'd share my room with somebody? And that too with Mr. Rudra? No. - What do you think? No. - Look, wrong. I can understand that there's a shortage of cottages.. ..but three women in a single room? Where have you been? - Take this cottage no.2. Mr. Sanjay, Tulu is the most sporting woman I've ever met. But the bed.. I doubt it, boy. Just take a look at the rooms. They're all deluxe rooms. Forget it. You can't provide normal rooms.. ..and you're talking of deluxe rooms. If need be, we can arrange for a separate cot. Sorry. No! What nonsense. Forget the mountain view. There's not even a window in that room. Change it. What are you standing here for? What are you looking at? How did Ms. Grouchy get a separate room? Go, talk to them. Mr. Ashim, my wife Madhuja wants to share the room.. ..with Ms. Grouchy. I'll stay with you all. What do you mean? - Okay, I'll share the room with Ms. Grouchy. Okay? Riya can stay with me. Come. Go get the luggage down. What if Bubai's bag gets lost? She's trusted me with it. - Come on. Coming. How did Rabi Chaterjee get a separate room with his miss? Even if though miss is not my Mrs. She still has a name. It's June.. and not Maliah. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, I'll take everything for you. Darling, I want to see tigers. This seat and room argument is rubbish. Where's the tiger? Change, change. I want the room changed immediately. There's no window, no view. Are you playing the fool with me? Are you trying to play the fool? - What is it? No.. it's alright.. just the view. Excuse me. I'm really sorry for the trouble. You all are in a problem because of me. Actually, I'm myself in a problem. That's why. I have no money. Otherwise I would've paid. But your friend.. Hari. Yes, Hari. He said there's no problem. Once we reach Kalimpong, I'll sort out everything. I have a friend there. We're not finding it inconvenient in the least. I hope you're not either. No, no. not at all. And Ms. Ganguly.. She's very sweet. Really? Yes. - Good. Will you convey a message to your friend? Whom? Hari. Oh. What? I'm really grateful to him. I'll.. - I'll tell him. I'll tell him myself. - No, no. I'll tell him. And if you need anything.. tea, coffee, food.. ..you can tell me. Great place! Or as we say back home. - Spiffy. No, seriously. You've.. apart from minor mismanagement.. ..which is understandable.. .. you've chosen a wonderful place. Thank you so much and I'm sorry I.. That's just fine. It's a part of our job. You two carry on, I'll just come. May I? Yes, sure. I'm yet to know your name. Riya Sen. Dr. Debashish Basu. Or as I'm called, Debashish Bose. Wimbledon. Where? South London. Have you ever been there? It's a beautiful place. Quaint, you may say. It's been almost.. ten years since I came to India. Me and my wife, Tulu. You must've met her? Lovely person. She's very unique. What you call psychic. Do you believe in tarot? Tarot cards? What? You know, people often confuse it for witchcraft.. ..or mumbo jumbo. As a man of science, tarot is not mumbo jumbo. For that matter, Tulu can predict even without cards. Past, future, everything. She just needs to hold your hand for a minute or so.. ..and then she'll tell you everything. You should try it sometime. You look so hassled. She'll hold your hand, just for a minute.. ..and then tell you everything. How long are you going to carry on.. ..with that ridiculous story? What does that mean? Are you trying to say.. ..that I'm trying to make a fool out of her? First of all you're a doc, that is, a science student. Secondly, the country where you stay.. ..is considered as a supreme civilisation. England, the birthplace of Charles Darwin.. ..and Issac Newton. You know why you're still here? Why? - That's because you're a Bengali. The world needs me. Please don't keep me in shackles. Please free me, beloved. Where's the beloved? She has headache. So, she's resting inside. What's this? Rum and cola in equal amounts? Increase the amount of cola, please. Please free me. Do you want to say something? Do you have some Vodka? With a bit of lime cordial? Even fresh lime would do. Won't whisky do? I'll just go and check with.. - No, no. Let it be. I was asking if you all have a bit. It's alright. Do you have a light? Most certainly. What do you do for a living? Man watching. Have you read about it? Man? Desmond Morris, behavioural science. What's that? - Studying human beings. Looking at a person's appearance.. .. and body language and predicting his behaviour. Oh. I must say you're talented. Okay, what can you predict from looking at me? Mr. Shekhar. - Yes. Stop betting on races. It never really helps anyone. Races? What does that mean? That race booklet has been peeping from your pocket.. ..all day. Professor Dhurjati pretends to be an open person.. ..but always puts a cover on the book he reads. And Mr. Ashim. There's no doubt you're intelligent. But a good businessman must also be honest.. ..apart from being intelligent. How did you understand that I'm dishonest? Amongst all of us only Mr. Rabi got a separate room. He's.. Yes. He's paying 'At Home' extra money for it. Right? No, no, no. In Kolkata itself.. You bribed 'At Home.' The lower berth in the train, a front seat in the bus.. ..and then a separate room here. But that doesn't mean.. .. everyone in your company is deceptive. Mr. Hari is extremely sensitive and transparent. Constantly helping a helpless girl.. ..calls for both, sensitivity and courage. Okay, what can you predict about me? You can't spend your life.. ..trying to satisfy others, Mr. Ananda. You feel you can avoid unpleasantness by being nice. Maybe Madhuja wants to talk her heart out you. Heart out. That was a sermon unasked for, wasn't it? Sorry. I ruined your conversation. But Mr. Ashim, this place is really beautiful. And if you don't mind, if you could get my dinner.. ..sent to my room, I'll be really grateful. Are you a detective? Not, really, but I write about detectives. You write? What does that mean? Thanks. Mystery thrillers. I write them. My pen name is Deepak Chatterjee. Good heavens! You're Deepak Chatterjee? I'm a great fan of Pralay Singha. I've read the whole series. Who's Pralay Singha? The detective of her novels. That means you're really what they call Agatha Christie. The range of detective stories in Bengali Literature.. ..by far exceeds those not just in the western literature.. ..but every other literature on the world. Almost each of our authors.. ..have a detective series each to their credit. There are other women apart from Agatha Christie.. ..who write mystery novels? I can't believe it. There are loads of them. You can start with say.. Ashapurna Devi. What? - Exactly. Ashapurna Devi? I didn't know that. Good night. There's nothing to look so defeated about. She's not as much as she shows to be. I've read Pralay Singha. Cheap stuff. Horrible. Giving bribes is cheap too as is accepting them. If there's someone who must ditch, it should be you. Five girls ditched you.. ..and you're again stepping into the same trap. Learn to ditch. Learn how to ditch.. ..otherwise your life won't change. Once, just once try to ditch someone. See how your confidence level boosts. You'll start paying more attention to the business. Do you think I'm not paying attention to the business now? No, you're not. You're not. If you did, you wouldn't burden us with that girl. On one hand we don't have enough rooms.. ..and our clients are not paying us on the other. Isn't it a loss for us? The poor girl is in trouble. Okay, I'll bear the expense of feeding her. It's not the question of bearing expenses. It is. What do you all think? That June or July or God knows what.. That Nabin Chatterjee or whoever he is.. You think he can make more money? You think he's smarter, right? Of course! I'm smart and calling you stupid is an understatement. Okay, okay, fine. Okay. Forget business. You tell me, how can you be so sure.. ..that the girl is not manipulating you? Oh, Lord. Oh, good Lord. She has herself told me. She was on her way to meet someone. What's she supposed to do if he doesn't turn up? She's a child, a young girl and she's stranded. Is there nothing called humanity? Hey, Shekhar. Shekhar. Marvellous. He's sure the girl isn't lying to him. So, you know everything, don't you? Hey, stop it you Morons! That nitwit Ms. Detective. Even if I bet on races, do I ask her dad to pay for it? She's driving me crazy. And that Professor and his admonitions. And the other moron and his pillows, windows, underpants. That fatty can't stop bragging about London. Go hug his wife and she'll predict everything. Where did you find these people? Why didn't you find some? Why didn't you? You were busy betting on your races then! I get the clients, I arrange for the money.. ..I do everything. I gave this idiot just one responsibility of booking rooms. And he's made a complete mess out of it. What have you done? What have you all done? You all know that I can't sleep on these tables and chairs. You don't have to sleep. You don't have to sleep here. Just get out! Go tell your dad to make you a mattress out of his umbrellas. How dare you bring my father into this? Why? Are you the Prince of Wales? No, don't mention my father. I've told you that my father's name ruins my drink. Hey, Poet. Poet, serve drinks. Does business mean only money? Yes, sir. Money is an essential factor.. ..and it takes caliber to earn it. Just a minute, just a minute. I'm not here only to earn money. Than what have you come here for? To write poems? I believe.. that whatever I do.. ..I put my heart into it.. and that's the way it should be. Hari did the same thing. He fell in love with that girl, picked her up.. ..put her on the bus.. as he wishes. Love can't be one sided. What does one sided mean? Have you tried to find out if the girl loves you? Hey, hey, wait. Wait. Hey, Hari. You've fallen in love? How can one person talk so much nonsense? Mrs. Basu. I wanted to as you.. I've heard you can predict futures by holding hands? Debo told you this, didn't he? He exaggerates a lot. Please. Can you or can't you? It just happens sometimes, I don't do it on purpose. Can it happen right now? Please. It's not happening. It just happens accidentally at times, you know. I mean the accident can happen right now. Can't it? Please. What is that book you're reading? A thriller? No, it's a book of chemistry. Oh no. It's not happening. I mean, is that much time enough to make out? It happens in the snap of a finger if it has to, otherwise not. Come. You've come here all alone? The place is not safe. I know this place very well. I've lived in the hills for a long time. Oh, really? Where? Darjeeling. Loreto Convent. Oh.. yes. That means you must know this place like the back of your hand. Right? Last night you all had a major argument over me, right? I'm really sorry about it. Oh, last night? Last night, we all were cracking jokes on each other. Shekhar doesn't approve of me staying here at all, right? No, no. Not Shekhar. Actually, Ashim is the one in charge of the trip.. ..so, he was just a little stressed out. And Shekhar? That drunkard starts yelling every time he gets very drunk. No. Actually he loves his father a lot. His father has a business in umbrellas but he's aged. Shekhar looks after everything. He doesn't let his father work. His father is all alone there and he was missing him. So, I was just trying to console him and nothing else. Lovely guy. And you don't look after the business? What? The business. Oh, me.. actually.. I do look after it. The four of us were in school together. We're from Bagbajar Vidyapeeth ( university). Okay. So all of you are school friends, yes? Yes. We had a band too. You sing? Yes, a little bit. Please sing something. What? - A song. Here? Why, is it a bad place? No, it's okay. Come on then, sing a song. Please. Please! Okay. Oh, my God. Listen, where are we going? I think.. I mean I've been thinking for a while.. ..that we don't ever have heartfelt conversations. Heartfelt? - Heartfelt. Last night you must have poured liquor down your gullet. The moment I went to another room.. ..you went and joined those morons. But what I'm saying has nothing to do with drinking. We never have a useful conversation. Who fails to say useful things? Did you call Nepla? Did you remind him about Dad's medicines? I'm sure Nepla has that much sense. How can one forget about a medicine just like that? Amazing. Whose responsibility is it? Nepla's or ours? I couldn't catch tower. What couldn't you catch? - Tower, tower. Don't you try to fool me. I've spoken to Bubai a little while ago. Really? You should've called them then. Of course. I should do everything. Its better I do everything. I don't need anybody to do a favour to my old father. I'll do whatever needs to be done. Go away. Madhu. Oh, no. Madhuja! A morn found by chance. On an unknown path. I find a song inside my soul. I find it. The warmth of the sun on a winter morning. All over my face, limbs and body. I suddenly find a song. I do. A meandering river on it's way, Amalgamates into the mist. A picture from childhood. Left back in the maths book by chance. A lost poem written by naive hands. A busy evening in a traffic jam. In my bustling city of Kolkata. I suddenly find a song, I do. A very ordinary sea, almost like a canal.. ..no beach, you know. Only pebbles. Spruced up with Fish and chips joints merry-go-rounds.. ..two piece bikinis, etc and sold to the whole world.. ..by the name of Brighton sea side. And look at us. What isn't there? What do we lack? We have forests, mountains.. what's the sea side called? Digha. - Yes, Digha, of course. Anyways, sorry. What do we lack, brother? And still we can't make the best of it. Marketing is where we failed. This is one thing, you know. Whenever I come back here, this really hurts me. Is that why you never returned to India? No, no, no, no. The reason for not returning is different. There's a lot of politics in our medical profession. It's beyond imagination. I mean, I'm young. I'm relatively new in the profession. But I know, I see them day in and day out. I know. Here, ask him. Has he shifted to tourism from medicine just like that? How's everything going? Absolutely fine. Yes. I've ordered breakfast. What do you want to have for lunch? How's Ms. Detective doing? Absolutely fit. I think she's writing. Good morning! - Oh, she writes? Yes, Agatha Christie. Good morning. Good morning. - Baby, where are the others? Have they all gone off to see the tigers? Some have gone for a walk. There's a jungle right opposite. Want to go? Are you nuts? I don't have that craze. A vacation is meant to conserve energy not waste it. Don't say that in my Tulu's presence. She's a hardcore trekker. That's why I saw her leave early in the morning. Where have they gone? She's found a tribal temple nearby. Elephants are said to come there.. ..and offer water by spraying it with their trunks. Wow. Is the Professor interested in temples too? I thought it was chemistry. The Professor's name keeps slipping off my mind. He's Dhu.. Dhur.. - Dhurjati. He's.. I mean.. difficult to gauge, isn't he? No sense of humour. He's dangerous. Baby, why do you keep making up stories? You know, he's talking nonsense all the time. Really? - Yes. Why, what did you see? What do you think I did? A professor of chemistry and perpetually in a bad mood.. ..but leaves early in the morning with a lady.. ..to visit a temple. Oh, you don't have to worry about that, brother. She's a black belt in Karate. Karate? What happened? Tired already? Forget it. Is this possible at this age? You carry on. I'll wait for you. No, no, no. That's not going to happen. Please, please, please. Don't be a spoil sport. Come on, get up. Listen, do you really think there's a temple in this forest? Let's forget the temple. You know what Mr. Ashim was saying? There are a lot of wild elephants in the forest and.. ..it's sacred to view them. Rubbish. I don't believe a thing they say. Can't we try once more? Rubbish. Oh, God. Ashim, where's that Shekhar? Why? His family's been trying to call me up but I keep losing signal. There, again. Yes, Aunt. Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. Did you write something? No, just gibberish. Is your tea over? How would tea get over so soon? You're in the land of tea. There's tea all around. The flavour's really good. Also the colour. I agree. You know, I didn't get to see any temple. According to the professor there is no temple. You need one of those local guides to take you around. Where would I find one? Why, are you looking for that temple too? No, I'm looking for the 'Dhanesh', Hornbill. I'm sure you must never have heard of it. What's that? - Bird. It's a bird. I thought this was a tiger resort. Debo. - Are you the Salim Ali type? I mean bird watching. Whatever is special to whichever place. If you want to visit a temple, you can go to Tirupati.. ..or Tarakeshwar or at least Kalighat. Whoever looks for a temple in a forest? The tea she's having here, is it CTC or Darjeeling variety? Have you ever thought about it? Listen. - Yes, tell me. Are we leaving after lunch? I'm not supposed to know that. - No. no. I didn't mean that. I mean if that is the case, then I'll cancel the eggs for lunch. If we have eggs for breakfast I won't be a good idea to have them.. ..again for lunch. Do what you want. Why are you talking like that? Anyways, forget it. Pass me a nice egg. Hey, what's this? Sorry. - We're having chicken curry and rice for lunch. By the way, it'll be evening by the time we reach Kalimpong. Listen, are we going to be at home there too? I mean do we have to share rooms there too? No compromise in Kalimpong. Your mountain view is guaranteed. Good morning! So, did you sleep well? You're having eggs again? No, it's my first? Don't lie. I've been watching you hog on them for a while. Have you seen Hari? Showing around the river bank. Whom? The Professor? The professor is in bed with a hot water bag at his feet. He went to looking for a temple early this morning and.. ..couldn't take it. Right now he's rejuvenating in his room. - Hey, Shekhar. What? - Come here. So, what do you say? We pack up? You all can take rest after breakfast. Then pack up, have lunch and then we'll push off. You all can indulge in a game of cards if you want to. No, no. Cards are boring. Is there no other game? No, no. Then Karaoke? Please, please I'll play Karaoke. Hindi, right? You're on my team. He's sneaked out with that girl as soon as he got a chance. What can we say? This is going over the top. How're you going to stop it. Let the moron come back. Listen, your family has been trying to call on my mobile. Forget the family. Who cares? Let that Hari come, I'm going to clobber him. Listen, I've set them to task. They'll take an hour. In the meantime we must make plan. What plan? Kalimpong's houseful. There isn't a single room available. I just called them. There, now they'll clobber us. No, they're not the clobbering type. We just have to plan out properly. Amidst all this confusion Hari's roaming around with that girl. Is your phone catching signal? It's coming and going. What will you do? You will.. you'll act. You'll get a phone call and you'll flare up.. ..which you're anyways an expert at. Acting? - There, Dr. Basu is annoyed now. Okay you can be in your wife's team. Please don't argue. You can go over the songs mentally. May I have a cup of tea? Professor.. sorry, your name keeps slipping off my mind. Kiriti Roy. Why don't we start with the game? We're playing a game of Karaoke. Which team are you on? None. My tea? Fine. I'll start with one of my compositions. You don't have to worry so much. Listen carefully to what I say. When the bus nears Kalimpong.. ..we'll get a phone call. I'll give the phone to you. You receive the call and just flare up. And then? And then leave the rest to me. The phone call just needs to come on time. Come on, there's still time. Let's set off leaving behind all worries. Free of all bindings, let's transcend all obstacles. Let's travel for the sake of the journey. Let's forget the destination. I'll hum the tune of my journey, While you start off with yours. What if this road never came to an end? Tell me how it would be. What if this world were a land of dreams? Tell me how it would be. What if this road never comes to an end? Tell me how it would be. What if this world is a land of dreams? Tell me how it would be. The bluish sky peeping from the gaps in the pines. Beckons you towards itself. The playhouses on those distant mountains. Float on the clouds of mist. You too, through the gap between your lips. Smile without a reason. Walking through these winding streets. Leading uphill, let's together sing that song. What if the road never came to an end? Tell me how it would be. What if this world were a land of dreams? Tell me how it would be. Just a second. Stop the singing. Stop the singing, please stop the singing. Could you please stop the bus? What happened now? Yes? What happened? They have stopped the bus again. What's the excuse this time? A new stranger? Hey, Shekhar. Hey! It's for you. Can't he answer the call while the bus is in motion? We are being delayed because of a mere phone call. Hello. Be careful. The time isn't good. 'Shekhar had to return.' 'His father passed away all of a sudden.' 'Massive heart stroke.' 'Shekhar never returned to our business.' In fact none of us are into this business anymore.' That was our first journey and the last as well.' Yes, keep it there. - Go, go. Yes, listen. Listen, listen. I've decided. One of you can share the room with me and Professor. And you can have an extra cot put.. ..in Dr. Basu and Mr. Ananda's room. And the third person can put up with Rabi Chaterjee. That's it. Problem solved. But has the watchman been convinced? I mean after all it's a forest bungalow and without permission.. You don't have to worry about that. It has been arranged for. Fine. Only, we couldn't arrange for your mountain view. You can think about them later on. First think of me. Come. Mountain view. Forget it. Oh, one more thing. I hope you've called Shekhar's family. Yes, I have. Fine, then there's nothing to worry about as of now. Oh, and there's no soap in the toilet. I'll see to it. - Please. We're going to the market. The watchman said that there's nothing in the kitchen. So, we thought of having a small picnic in the lawn. No, no. Trust me we have all arrangements in place. No way. We want to organise a dry lunch.. ..so, we will. But we have.. Look it's no problem at all. And I wanted to cook. Are you sure? - Yes. Do you know your way to the market? We're taking the driver with us. Don't worry. Go carefully. Yes, we will. Yes, so.. What's this? Why did you go there? What are you doing here? What's wrong with you? No, I was just thinking, will it be very inconvenient.. ..if I don't go to the market? But why won't you? No, I'm feeling a bit uneasy in the stomach. I shouldn't have had the cauliflower yesterday. So last night you gobbled on cauliflowers with your soda? Do what you want. Speak softly. I'm fed up. Come along. - Come on, let him relax. So they're going to the market. The lunch is managed. But the dinner.. The dinner is completely our responsibility. We have all arrangements. - Oh, then its fine. Brother, the place is very nice. But it's cold here. So if you could.. Actually, my stomach is not well. The cauliflowers last night didn't do me good. Excuse me. Yes. I hope your foot is okay. Yes. Could you arrange for a little bit of liquid for warming up. That way. Actually, right now there's only tea. Yes, yes. Tea is first class. Tea is fine. I'll see to it. There's one more thing. I don't know if I should be saying this. No, no. Tell me. - This is my personal opinion. This girl, Riya is hanging around with Ms. Grouchy.. ..and I'm sure she'll get into the same room with her. The point is that she was supposed to get down.. ..at Kalimpong. What's all this? There has to be some discipline. - Hey, come on. Where? Come on. We must put this to an end. I'll just come. Do you have a cigarette? I don't smoke. What do you do? I'm a librarian at South Point School. And you? Have you heard of Calcutta Auction? Of course. Park Street. Yes, that belongs to my grandpa. So, do you have a grandfather's clock there? The one which strikes every hour.. ..and a sparrow peeps out? Not sparrow. It's a cuckoo. Why do back bite so much? What does that mean? You can see whatever is going on. All of a sudden why did you bend upon.. ..having the girl chucked out? Oh, God. What's this? I mean I was only trying to help them out. Why would I want to have her chucked out? And what did you say? Back biting? That what I heard you doing. Not at all. Don't ever say that. I.. you.. you.. you sell age old antiques.. well and good. But I can't stand this age old mentality. Back biting? That's not how you talk to a gentleman. A cigarette.. Forget it. Excuse me. I wanted to speak to you. To me? Yes. Could you please come with me that side? Sure. - Please. Nice place. How did you get the permission? Ms. Ganguly was saying.. ..you need a letter from the forest department for that. Yes, actually, Ashim made all the arrangements. Do you want to say something? No, I mean.. how long are you going to stay with us? No, nothing else. Just so that we could make arrangements likewise. Can I have a cup of tea? Sure. Of course. Actually, go to your room. I'll have the tea sent over. You're a writer, isn't it? But if you write somewhere that we entered the forest bungalow.. .. without permission, we'll be in a soup. Did you bring me here so that we could discuss my writing? The way you've been at it since morning.. ..it looks like you'll be out with a novel soon. If the truth about the bungalow sneaks into it.. I believe, you brought me here.. ..so that you could speak to Riya alone.. ..which is what Sanjay is doing right now. When you understand so much.. ..you must also understand that you should've asked us.. ..before accommodating that girl in your room. Because we are still in charge of all the arrangements. What's your problem? The money? You may snub at the name of money.. .. but you also can't deny it's importance. Instead of having to spend the night in the bus.. ..we could enter the bungalow.. ..because the watchman needed money. I need it too. For me there's a need of honesty as well. And if some one is in trouble.. ..there's a need to extend a helping hand as well. The watchman is poor. He has taken to dishonesty to get a better life.. ..but you're the one who has tempted him. Whose fault is it? Yours or the watchman's? You forget that I too am running this business.. .. to have a better life, not to take people on tours for free. Whose fault is it? Mine or Riya's? My name's not Riya. It's Keya. I stay in Kolkata. I was about to get married. Neither my parents nor my family accepted the marriage. They were forcing me to go to Texas. We decided to elope and get married. Me and my friend, Ronny. What does your friend Ronny do? Nothing as such. I mean, he doesn't do anything as such. His uncle owns a hotel in Darjeeling. He was going to work as a manager there. We were supposed to meet in Siliguri. At the Siliguri station. We were going to go to Darjeeling from there. But he didn't meet. I mean, he didn't turn up. And he's also not taking my calls. I don't know where he is. Nothing's wrong I hope. Accident? Had that been the case, his family would have told me. His family members are disconnecting the phone.. ..as soon as they hear me speak. I don't have any place to go. How insulting! She listened to the song at the banks of the river. I sang to her while shivering in the cold. Just imagine. You start thinking clearly. Can you even think? You're fattening up like a broiler chicken.. ..as the days are passing by. First, it was Sharmila. You didn't know English, so she left you. Then it was Nandita. She didn't know how to send an email so you called it quits. Don't shiver. Try to understand. She was Riya. Now, we come to know that she's Keya. Next, she'll say that she's Saira Banu. God knows who she really is. She's supposedly been ditched.. ..by the one she's married. She's spending a jolly time and travelling at our expense.. ..while you're singing a song to her. Just a second. - Idiot. I want to say something. Actually Ronny's ditched her. In that situation, a girl couldn't have done much alone. Oh, stop that. Whatever we're earning is all getting spent.. ..in paying the interest along with the loan. We're left empty-handed. On one hand there's Shekhar's matter.. ..on the other hand this moron was singing songs to her. Look, I don't know. We've to chuck her out. That's all. Someone else can stay with Ms. Grouchy in her room. The doctor and Tulu in another one. So, there's no discount. I mean, this is too much. They talk of Wimbledon, Shakespeare.. ..and when it comes to sharing a room, they talk of discounts. No discounts will be given. No, no. No one's causing problems regarding the house. That's only because Shekhar's father's no more. Will you handle them when they realise the real problem? Look, I'm just saying that suppose Shekhar's father.. ..hadn't been dead and we stuck to our original plan.. No, no. Ashim is saying the right thing. Hey just wait. The girl's eating out of our hands. Who's going to pay the extra money? You? Yes, I'll pay. I'll have to pay in case needed. A lonely girl is stuck in such a big difficulty. She was crying in the bathroom. Now, you can cry too but I'm going to get rid of her. And you.. you got her into the bus. You're going to go and tell her straight that we'll need money. She's a rich man's daughter. She has money and she'll have to pay. I'm giving you half an hour to tell her. It's no use looking at me. She made such a fool out of me. You'll see I won't speak to her again. She told you. You go and speak to her. If she has to stay here, she'll have to spend her own money. Oh, no! I think you should jump from here. Look, she's told you the truth, right? She's not told me. You should go and tell her.. Just go and tell her straight out.. ..that either she can ask me for forgiveness otherwise.. We've decided that.. - That I should leave. Right? No, no, no. Not at all. Certainly not. We can't leave you in such a difficult situation, right? What's he saying? Who? Hari. Hari, Ashim.. they all want that.. ..actually one can't blame them either.. ..it's our business right? We have to keep it running. But I personally feel, I feel that.. ..you shouldn't be alone in such a turmoil. I think that you should at least accompany us to Darjeeling. Hari is right. I lied to him. I shouldn't have lied to him. I should have told him the truth at the beginning. I know why he's so unhappy. Believe me I had no other way out. I know. See I.. I completely understand.. ..what you're going through. And trust me, I sympathise. If you can understand, then go and tell him. Tell who? Hari, that I'm sorry. Actually, I should have told him. Yes, actually I should go and tell him myself. Where is he? Oh, no. Why? Please don't bother. I'll do it. You can relax. What did she say? What she said.. - I mean, did she say.. ..that she's forgotten him? Did she say that it wasn't right to make a monkey out of me? No, we didn't talk about monkeys. No, I don't mean to talk about monkeys. I mean, did she say that it was wrong of her to deceive me? Look. Anyone can say this. I mean. Anything can have several interpretations. Now, if someone says this in sign language then.. She said it, right? She made a mistake. Yes. She said that to me, right? No. Then who did she say that to? - Good day. Who did she tell that to? She didn't say anything to anyone individually. Generally. She said it to everyone. Oh, then she can accompany us to Darjeeling. Thereafter, she can go wherever she wishes to. I'll deal with Ashim. You'll deal with him? Yes. - You? Look, when I got the girl into the bus.. ..I'm responsible for what happens to her. She deceived you. She's a nice girl. Look, the situation was such that she had no other way out. She told me all those things. Then she probably thought that if I get angry.. ..and get rid of her.. She likes me in her own way. She'd have definitely told me later on. I'm sure. No, I'm kind of confused. She loves you. And she's telling me the truth? You won't be able to get it. You won't understand what a girl wants. You go. Tell her. Don't do this. You're such an old friend of mine. Why can't you understand? I'll falter while speaking in English. I'll make a mess out of it. Go and tell her please. What am I supposed to say? I don't know where he's been out since morning. I haven't got a glimpse of him. There should be some sense of responsibility. In the morning.. in the morning, did you see.. ..how he fled when it came to shopping? Have you tried couple therapy? Which therapy? So, all you want is me to accompany you to Darjeeling? Well, I can't really vouch for the others. But I know I do. What did Hari say? You know what it's very difficult to gauge Hari. He's a bit difficult. It might seem that I'm backbiting. But I'm not, trust me. Hari is actually very unpredictable. He has a bit of a sad history with him.. ..and it keeps happening all the time. But you know him, right? I don't know. Even I'm confused at times. What are you saying? You don't trust him? No, I didn't say that. He's nice. He's really nice. It's not that he's bad. But people can't understand him. Exactly. See, it's so easy to understand you. You're very clear.. direct. What Hari lacks is clarity. He's not transparent like you. There's no mystery. Yes. I think there are two kinds of people. There's one kind which is very transparent. The other kind's mysterious. Somehow I feel that the first kind is very boring. And the other kind, I mean, if someone not mysterious.. ..then you can't interact with him for long. Getting to know him as a whole new person everyday.. ..getting to see a new side to him.. ..I guess according to you I'm very boring. No, that's not true. No, no. You.. sorry you, the thing is.. I think, I should apologise. Where is Hari? Yes? Maybe inside the bungalow, right? Hari.. - Thanks, bye. I was just looking for you. I can't help but ask you.. ..that have you ever thought of writing a cinema script? I mean, when one comes down to such a place.. ..there're many relationships.. ..so many colourful things. Actually, I have film society. I'm very passionate about it. I've seen a lot of movies like.. ..'Gone With The Wind. My Best Friend's Wedding..' ..'Walk In The Clouds.' I'm very fond of these movies. Have you ever thought of this? I mean, it's possible. I'll think about it. Come let's have a talk about this. Do you have a cigarette? Yes. You know, I was thinking.. ..there'd be a huge mansion's scenery and then cut to next.. 'Come quickly.' - 'A-1.' 'Now A-2.' - I'm here. 'A-3.' - I suppose you people are stuck on A. 'A-4.' 'Aan Milon Sajna.' Oh, great. - That's it. Now, it's your turn. You were talking a lot of nonsense since long. I'll tell. I'll tell. Don't force me. - A-1. 'Sajna.' That means it's A again. Count, count down faster. Come on count faster. - A-2. This is horrible. A-3, A-4. - What's the name of Satyajit Ray's last movie? A-5. - 'Aaguntuk.' Yes, that's it. Now, K-1, K-2. - K. - Oh, yes, it's K-3. 'King Solomon's Mine.' Would that do? Of course. 'Mines.' There's an S. Forget that. Is this a game about names of places? Oh, no! King Solomon's Mines.' I haven't ever heard of that. No, no. It's there. Stewart Granger, Ava Gardner starred in the movie. 'King Solomon's Mines.' Mines means it's an S you got to start with. A movie starting with S.. - 'Spiderman.' Yes! - Spiderman, Spiderman. N-1. - N-2. - N-2. I'm out of this. Come on, tell me. N-3. Where's Riya? She didn't have anything? N-4. She's caught a little cold. She's sleeping in her room. Don't change the topic. The count down is on. N-7. - What's the matter Doctor? - N-8 Tell us one of those London movies. N-9. There was this movie about snakes, isn't it? N. - Yes, 'Nagin.' Oh, that's the one. Yes, baby. N-1. 'Nishijapon.' Oh! Have some coffee and shake hands with me. It's N again. N..N..N. Noe.. N-1. - Oh, someone tell. N-2. N-3. Could you give me your glasses for a while? You're killing time by these things. I can understand. Give him these glasses. N-5. It's just at the tip of my tongue but I can't remember. N-6. - It's at the tip of your tongue. What was the name again? - N-7. Oh, it's looking great. - N-8. 'Nayak.' Oh, that was awesome. Really a good one. K..K-1. K-2. King and I. No, no, sir. There's a 'the' before that title. Debo, is there a the? No, no, no. You're not allowed to talk so much. K-4. K-5. K-6. 'Kuheli.', so now it's an I. Oh, superb. You're just amazing. - Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah. 'Izazat.' Of course. Oh, that's great. That's the spirit. It's a T. 'To Kill A Mockingbird.' It's not fun anymore. Come one. Tell. Three. 'Deya Neya.' Wow, that's a good one. What a movie. It's a D now. A-1. A-2. I'm not enjoying this game anymore. Come on, come up with something. - A-4. There was a Mrinal Sen movie. He'd got a Silver Bear (award) at Berlin. Of course. 'Aakaler Shondhane.' Oh, no! - You told something and that too for us. 'Shondhane' means it's an E. Tell something. Evita. It's an A. Anaconda. It's an A. Great! Simply amazing. Hey, have a sandwich. A-1. A-2. A-3. I'll get you some hot coffee. Everything will be all right. Oh, he can't get one now. - A-4. A-6. That's cheating. - What about A-5? A-5. A-6. - Can you think of something? A-7. - Come on quickly. This is not fair. You're counting too quickly. I didn't count like this. - Yes, count a bit slowly. Slowly, slowly. A-9. A10. You've lost. No, no, no. Yes, they've lost. - They've lost. They've lost. 'Aranyer Din Ratri.' Oh, that's fantastic. That's a great one. That's a great one. What happened? Ms. Basu? What happened suddenly? Ms. Basu? Dr. Basu? Has it got something to do with holding the hands? Are you okay? Are you feeling sick? Yes? What happened? Is it serious? Please everybody, no cause for worry. Whatever has to happen is unavoidable. What is going to happen? - What will happen? She'll tell everything all at once. What will she tell? Ms. Ganguly's past, future and just everything about her. Should I put her to sleep quickly? Get some water. - What are you talking about? This can't be true. Get some warm water. - Pure science, Mr. Rudra. Pure science. This is what parapsychology is. Oh, dear God. It's like 'Sonar Kella.' Would you shut up? - Let me see your hand. Can't you see someone's crying? - You're just too much! Is this a part of the prophecy? Oh! I can't explain it you, right? It won't be right if you go and speak to her right now. You can't understand. Ms. Grouchy has told me that she wants to talk to me.. ..since morning. I still can't explain it to you. The incident with Tulu just transpired right now. That's the reason why I'm saying this. You'll go in the middle of this to speak to her? You just can't seem to understand. Look. Everyone is with Tulu. Everyone's busy pacifying her. Now, I can have a frank conversation with the girl. You can't understand. Is this looking fine? Listen, tomorrow morning.. Tomorrow morning.. - Listen to me, tomorrow morning.. Apparently I can't understand anything! Everyone seems to know everything. Come on. Let's go. Where do I go? Come with me. I'll make it easy for you. Have this. Have a shot of this. All your worries will be reduced to none. I don't have any worries. - Thanks. I'm in this profession for a lot of days. Do you understand? Don't be shy. Don't be shy when it comes to me. Que sera sera. Have you heard that song? It's the anthem of my life. What'd I told you about dealing with things the other day? Oh, that madam something. No, it wasn't just something. It was crackerology. Madam Crackerology. Yes, Madam Crackerology. What does madam mean? A woman. Cracker? A fire cracker. Womanising? I've spent fifteen years like this. You mean? My passion and profession. It's what I do and I'm also passionate about. To meet women. To interact with them. To become friendly with them. To survive on their love. To spend money and make them spend as well.. ..until the love lasts that is. And then? A new number. Greener pastures. Cheers. Which number is this one, this June? She's number 15. You mean one per year. No, it's not that consistent. I mean, with some its for two months.. ..and with someone else its for two years. Who are these women? Either they are divorcees or their husbands have died. They might've inherited a lot of property.. ..or might have a lot of money of their own. But who's there to enjoy the luxuries with? Regarding June, it's been different. It's been different. She fell in love with me. What was I to do? She doesn't have a father but an uncle. They are into trading gold. Chuklader Jeweller. You've heard the name, right? You? Condemnable character. This is cheating. No, it isn't. I'm spending time with a woman who's lonesome.. ..and making some moments of her life ethereal. Would you call this cheating? You're earning this way. - I'm earning by loving someone. You're not doing that. This 'At Home Travels.' You're hesitating because you don't love what you're doing. Let's take Riya for instance. You think that you love Riya, right? Keya. What's in name? Let's concentrate on the crux of the matter. What's that? If you'd really love her, you'd want to know.. ..if she loves you too. She doesn't love you. She likes Hari. So, back out, back out. Look for greener pastures. I can't stand people anymore. Then, you'll have to understand.. ..you've to think of what else do you need except humans. How would I know what else do I need? It's a simple thing. Get Tulu to hold your hand.. ..she'll tell you everything. What nonsense! That's all rubbish. Parapsychology is meaningless. Everything is possible. Everything is possible. Did you get that? This car was moving. It was going smooth across the street. Suddenly, it stopped. It broke down. You'd call it an accident. I'd call it actual. Professor. He's preaching all the time. You'd say that he's spending sleepless nights.. ..worried sick about the country, right? I'd say something else. What's that? It's just Kiriti Ray's story without the cover. What's the matter? How long would you take, Driver? Would we have to walk? What? Are we going to stay here? Hari, listen. Oh, would you wait a while. Let me see what's going on. Again it got stuck up here. - I hate this. Instead of standing here, why don't you go for a walk? Why is that? No, Riya told me that she'd go for a walk.. over there. Could I get some tea? The pain in my foot has aggravated, so I.. You didn't get your chemistry thesis, right? Hold on. - No. Would you go? I'm.. - Go. Come, come. Let's take a picture. Would you have some tea? Tea. No. Are you sure.. that you didn't leave your thesis.. ..in the bungalow? No. I don't make such mistakes. I remember very distinctly that I'd put in into my bag.. ..with my own hands. It's been stolen. Nothing else. It's a theft? Who would understand your chemistry thesis, Professor? No one needs to understand it. It's a Bengali man's bad habit to encroach on other's things. Where's Professor Dhurjati? Oh, there he is! His thesis is lost so he's standing there all sad. Oh, we should be a little careful. In case someone's carrying something valuable. For example your camera. If it were to get lost.. - Would you stop? Please take the picture. Please take it. Oh, it's so cold. Could you take off your hood? Would I need to do that? - What's going on? It's sunny and then rainy. - We'll catch a cold. Take it fast. Listen up. Listen, I got it. No problem. Yes. There's a home up there. It's a missionary home. Take rest there for sometime. All the arrangements for the bathroom.. ..as well as food have been taken care of. It will take us some time to get the bus repaired. Home? It's a Christian orphanage. It's very nice. We spent that night at McCaulay's orphanage.' 'Someone in the orphanage was sick.' 'Ashim treated him all through the night.' You've been quiet since then and not expressive about it.' 'Hari spent the night romancing.' Rabi Chatterjee arranged for a bottle of country liquor..' '..from somewhere.' 'I drank quite a lot of it.' 'Hence, I don't remember everything.' Hey, come here. This is great. Keep the change. What are you trying to do? What? Here, it's forbidden to give money like this. Oh, please. Give me a break. The bus is not going to get repaired by tonight. At night.. who's going to arrange for things? He's been sick since long, sir. Since long. January. - Yes, I got that. Why didn't you call for a doctor? The father got him checked by a doctor a lot of times.. ..but it didn't help. Let go of that. It's no use asking for Bouse (a pill). Does anyone have Derifilin? (a pill) No, sir, to get medicine here.. Do you have Derifilin? What did you say? Go and ask that doctor from London if he has Derifilin. Derifilin. - Would you be able to remember that? Derifilin. - Yes. - I'll go right away. Go and tell Father Francis.. I don't know where the boys disappear.. ..when it comes to work. Hey, Sanjay. Sanjay. Is it hurting you? Is it? Is it feeling good? Will you say something? Hey, Hari. The serene night descends into the sky. The moon creeps in and sits beside it. It whispers songs into its ears. Thousands of stars light up again. My heart races away. I reach out to the sky. I don't know why? My heart troubles me so much. The night passes by. But I don't get any sleep. I lie wide awake.. ..in the shadows of my dreams. It seemed so adorned.. ..that I couldn't get any sleep. Will you throw up? Get up. Get up. Throw up. - You can't? I'd told you to get some salt water, right? What happened to that? Yes, it will just be here. It will be here in two minutes. See, he's been having this medicine. What rubbish! It's expired. He's been having it all these days. Would you have some sleeping pills? Sleeping pills? Go and get the warm water. Yes, I'll see to it. Sanjay. - You're not able to throw up? Come on, inhale. Inhale it. Inhale it. I don't know why sleep eludes me. I don't know what I wait for. I don't know why? My heart troubles me a lot. The night passes by. But I don't get any sleep. I lie wide awake.. ..in the shadows of my dreams. It seemed so adorned.. ..that I couldn't get any sleep. Don't worry. You took great care. Ashim couldn't save that man. You tried your best. To hell with what I tried. It doesn't happen this way. These treatments don't happen except in a hospital. There are no medicines, no facilities. Thanks. There was a time when I would feel very bad. I would feel angry. I would feel that everything about this country is hapless. I don't feel that way anymore. When I meet people like Father or you.. ..then my belief strengthens. The bus is ready. I think we should be going. Sanjay, call everyone. Let's go. Tell me, where has everyone gone? Mr. Rudra. Yes, it's happening. It's happening again. I can feel it coming. What? I'll tell you if I hold your hand. What do you mean? Seriously. A night as it was.. the Father's orphanage.. ..and then a sudden death. I'll tell you about it no sooner than I hold your hand. Okay, let's go to the bus and.. - No. Give me your hand. Let me hold it once. I'll tell you everything. I can feel it. Don't you want to know what lies in your future? Your love life? Your married life? Your conjugal life? You really don't want to know.. ..all your intimate details. Once, just once, hold my hand. Just once. Come, your husband is waiting for you. Hey, get up. This moron! Anyway, listen, I've called at Darjeeling. All the bookings have been finalised. Not only will discount not be offered for the net two days.. ..but we'll also have to incur the losses. First of all, I'll get rid of the bus. Hari is romancing Keya. You go jump off the terrace. Hey, Hari. Where are you? I'd once visited a saint in Tarakeshwar. I was in a relationship back then. The saint lay his hand on my forehead and said.. ..There's a prince coming your way. So, I didn't think much and got married. Little did I know that.. You know he drank.. ..all through last night? The frog prince. What? That tale about the frog prince. I read it long back, during childhood. I don't remember it anymore. Read it once more. You want me to read it? I've stopped reading since a long time. You know, I've spent all my life taking care of this man. Look, I feel that we should go to the Tiger Hill.. ..before going back to the hotel. Look, its much better if we go now. Otherwise, we'll have to rent a car again. The expenditure just keeps.. Have you joined.. ..the 'At Home Travel Agency?' What do you mean? I mean, you decided your time-table all by yourself. Do you have a problem with that? Yes, I do. - I do. I spent an awful night at the hotel yesterday. You were snoring away to glory. Who? I couldn't even see your face last night. I was treating someone. Treatment. Treatment and you? Yes, right. We won't be visiting any Tiger Hill. We've already spent so much. You can go and see the tigers all by yourself. Mr. Rudra has taken up the responsibility of our business.' 'We are not really a part of it anymore.' He's carrying on with it next to his auction house at Park Street.' 'He's stuck to the name we've chosen.' 'At Home.' Ashim was the first to quit this business.' 'He did that all of a sudden.' We don't know why he did that all of a sudden.' Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost. But now am found. Was blind. But now I see. 'You know, now a days I feel..' '..that its not really difficult to earn money.' Instead, there's an adventure in leading life to the fullest.' In my spare time away from the patients..' ..I farm, teach kids. I teach children English songs.' 'Just imagine.' 'I miss you all a lot.' 'I miss Kolkata a lot too.' 'But I can't stay away from here.' 'I don't know if I believe in God.' But to wake up and pray in the morning all together..' '..feels amazing.' By the way, what's going on with Ms. Grouchy?' 'Do you meet her?' It's grace that brought me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. You'll have to get an account of each penny. Money is primary and the house secondary. You go and collect the money from home. I'll get rid of the bus. Hari has gone to have some coffee with Keya. Yes, so, what do you want to do? Commit suicide? You! I won't give Hari a single penny. If you want your share then go and collect the money. Well.. have any of you seen June? No, she must be somewhere. And listen, don't take off. You still have to pay for your expenses. 'I can't find her.' All the facilities have been taken care of. Everyone would have a separate cottage. There'd be good geysers in the bathrooms. A fireplace which they will set afire.. ..after dinner as per their wishes. You can ask for a heater too. Anything else that seems to be problem? Now, let's discuss the money to be collected. If you all could pay the money.. Did you really join At Home Travels? No, no. Since Shekhar left, they've been facing some problems. I'm just trying to help out. That's all. It's an interesting business. Thank you. In our West Bengal, it can be expanded no bounds. Just look around. Do you.. - No, thanks. Unbelievably rich. However, Mr. Rudra, if you're in the business.. ..you have to believe in it. You've to love that richness and that panorama. You've to love it. You think so? - Of course. It's a simple thing. If you want to earn by exhibiting nature.. ..then you'll have to enjoy nature as well. You have to enjoy it. Regardless of anything else.. ..I was driven to learn one thing from the Englishmen. One can't do something just for the sake of it. You have to love your work. Otherwise it just doesn't work. Even with so much of knowledge.. ..it hasn't really helped the country, has it? Professor. Professor, that is relative. Living outside your country doesn't imply in anyway at all.. ..that you've forsaken your country. Today, Bengalis are no longer restricted to Bengal. We're all over the country, continent, world. Who is gaining from that? It's making all the Bengalis proud. - Correct. No, it's all about economics. You're settled in London as a second class citizen.. ..for the sake of a little money. Bengalis are not benefiting from that. We need doctors here and now. Professor Kiriti.. I mean.. You can't remember a blooming Bengali name.. ..and you'll apparently make Bengalis proud? Nonsense. I mean, I keep forgetting the name every time. Is it Durjodhon? Pauruti? Got it? Oh, got it. Dhurjati. Of course. Look, Mr. Dhurjati. Consider the Jews. They've dominated the whole planet. Isn't that correct? Be it in Europe or America. From nuclear science to rock music. You name it. Woody Allen, Leonard Cohen. Anybody. Now, why is that? Have they been sitting in Jerusalem.. ..bundled up in their kibbutz? No, they've sailed the seven seas. As have we. Remember Professor, there's a traveller in every Bengali. And yet we're not chameleons. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.. ..unless you're a Bengali. Definitely. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we remain Bengalis. That's right. Today, had our Mr. Jyoti Basu been a part of the democrats.. ..he'd have easily toppled George W. Bush. What rubbish are you talking? Oh, just a minute, Mr. Basu. Have you seen June? No. Have you all seen her? Have you seen Ms. Grouchy? How are you my dear? - I'm fine. Do you miss me? - Yes. Do you miss me at all? This.. Share this with all your friends, okay? All right. Had your dad come here? No, he'd called. Are you writing in to your dad? - Yes. You must write to him every week.. ..and make sure you listen to him, okay? All right. Would you need more pocket money? No, dad's given me. Sure, he's given you? Sure? - Sure. Stay well. - Yes. - And study hard. - Okay. Good boy. Go. You're class is going on. Bye. - Bye. You all carry on. I'll come back after a walk. Don't worry, I'm okay. I can't accept divorces. What can one do if it's already done? Can you accept a divorce? Suppose we get married and then have a fight.. ..and then a divorce. Will you be able to accept it? Actually that would depend upon the reason.. ..you want a divorce for. I didn't like you. I fell in love with someone else. I'll murder you. Don't talk nonsense. Just don't talk nonsense. What's so nonsensical about this? Anyways, I'm having a severe headache.. ..and I want to go home. You told me that you wanted to stroll around.. ..walk around a little. I never said I want to walk. I just said I wanted to shop. You can walk.. You can walk while shopping and shop while walking. Don't be silly. I don't want to talk to a man.. ..who doesn't understand the difference.. ..between shopping and walking. I'm sorry but I can't help it. I just can't tolerate those people.. ..who don't understand the basic difference.. ..between walking and loitering in a closed shopping mall. Okay, okay fine. I got you. You don't have to jabber in English. Just because you're from Loreto Convent.. ..you're so arrogant, aren't you? - To hell with you! If you bring in Loreto Convent into everything.. Hey, how are you? Actually, it's my cousin's birthday. So, I came to buy toys for him. I wonder if the shops have closed down. Listen, my cousin recently got married.. ..and she wants to go to Darjeeling for a vacation. Could you arrange for it? I've given up tours and travels. I don't do it anymore. You've given up too? So, who's looking after the business now? Mr. Rudrashekhar. He's doing really well. Is that so? Shekhar too, has earned a lot of name and fame. Do you meet him? No, I don't but I know he has. And Ashim? He writes to me. At the Father's place? Hey, when are you getting married? I'm in no hurry. Bye. Drop in at our place someday, please. I will, thanks. Call me. Yes, I will. I'm late. I'd better go. Bye, take care. Bye. I'm taking the car home. You can stay back if you want to. Why do you have to take everything so far? What do you want? - Do you want a divorce? You think I can't divorce you? I will divorce you before that. Tell me clearly, what you want. What do you want me to clarify about? What are you looking at? All these five girlfriends who ditched you one by one.. How come you didn't kill them? Why kill them? I was never in love with them. So, what are you trying to say? That you love me? Yes. I mean, actually. How do you understand? Well, you can feel it when you're in love. I never felt Ronnie would ditch me. I won't ditch you. My parents won't accept you. In that case we'll have to make an alternative arrangement. There's an extra room in Ashim's house. I'll go back home. If you go home they'll forcefully send you to Texas. Not if I don't want them to. Then why did you flee home? Because I didn't understand then. What? After travelling with you all for a few days.. ..I've realised something. There are no shortcuts in life. Waves are lost, And waves emerge again. Flowers wither away, And they blossom again. There's no death, nor an end, There's no poverty, nor any pain. In that wholeness, let my heart seek a place, Lord. There's sorrow and there's death, And loneliness incinerates. And yet there's peace and joy, And yet eternity prevails. I strained my back while returning from the mall. I felt a sort of cramp, so I sat down to rest. And then I looked at these trees and.. Yes, of course. Only the trees, mountains, rivers and rocks. Have you ever thought of me.. - No, no. ..and sung a song? No, it's not the trees. I actually sang because I thought of you. Don't lie to me! I've called Nepla. I've asked him to tell your father.. ..that we're reaching day after tomorrow. Listen, can someone really make a prediction.. ..just like that, by holding hands? What? Telepathy? It's also said that we are all telepathic. Whatever happened in our past lives.. ..is lodged in our subconscious minds.. ..but we don't remember it on a conscious level. We recall it immediately.. ..as soon as we get even the slightest of hints. Suppose, I was a French filmmaker, say, Jean Renoir. And you.. suppose you were Queen Rashmani. I was a queen and you were a foreigner? Why, can't I be a foreigner too? Of course you can. I was just giving an example. Tulu was saying that anybody can do that, you know. You just have to hold someone's hands.. .. and concentrate. Maybe, yes. So then hold my hand. Hey, I just remembered the story of the frog prince. No one knows what's going to happen and when?' 'Shekhar suddenly shot to fame.' He made it big in modern Bengali music.' Hey, there.. You quit 'At Home' as well? Yes. The business didn't succeed. Ashim, I heard, is meditating somewhere like a sage. You people made it in life. Not a sage. He's working for a missionary home. One and the same thing. Hari had come. Married and all. He came to ask for money. He has children already. Dirty affair! Did you lend him? I don't lend money. What's there to lend between friends? He couldn't pay the hospital bills. I did. How are you doing? Not good. How are you? Please give me an autograph. Not for me. For my wife. Pragyaparomita Roy Dutta Chowdhary. I'll make it 'Dear Sister-in-Law.' Okay, thank you. Thank You! So, rest all fine? Okay. - Okay, move on. I'm going on. You never got anywhere because of your going on. You could never complete a single sentence in your life. Listen, if you don't want tea, I have good stuff. Imported. No, I prefer tea. Listen, when a drink is served, it's served. Irrespective of whomever it is served for.. ..it must be shared. So, do you want it? Tell me. I'm fine with tea. Why don't you tell me what you want? You didn't get married. Do you have a girlfriend at least? I don't need money. Sir, they're all waiting for your album at 'Music World'.. ..those people from 'Sa Re Ga Ma.' Listen, the need for money never ends. You think I'm showing off because I have it today. There were times when I've eaten out of your hands. Nowadays, I don't get to see you all very often. Today that I have, I'll not let you go. I've a music launch with Sa Re Ga Ma. I'll have to go Music World for a while. But you wait right here. I'll be back in a jiffy. I think I should leave. I'm not letting you go anywhere. Today that I've got hold of you, I'm not letting you go. How many celebrities have you ever shared a drink with? Sit. Take care of him. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! I forgot my bag of cosmetics in the bus. Oh, no. Has the bus left? - Yes. I had all my imported cosmetics in that bag. I checked the bus thoroughly. There was nothing in there. I can't find my cell phone either. What? Please check all your belongings.. ..to see if anything else is missing. Because my wallet along with the debit cards is missing. What does that mean? Oh hell! Excuse me. I'll just come. It means even June is missing. What? She vanished as soon as she got off the bus. I think she sneaked everything she had to.. ..at the missionary's charitable home itself. You all can speak to the hotel management at Darjeeling.. ..or speak to the police. But I think she's on her way to Siliguri. June? Kleptomania. There's no mania. She's just a thief. Her uncle's jewellery shop has been contacted. It's all humbug. Over confidence. Too much confidence. This is why we Bengalis stand nowhere. How stupid can you get? You've been having an affair with her for so long.. ..and you couldn't gather this much information about her? Why, has she polished off everything? I'm not that much of a fool, sir. She'll spend ages swiping that debit card.. ..without gaining as much as a penny out of it. There's no balance in that account. Agreed. But the cash? With utmost care. I met June a couple of times at various places.' She was escorted by a different man each time.' I met Ms. Grouchy and the Professor once.' They were at 'Inox' (a multiplex) for a movie.' I suppose he has stopped putting covers on his books.' Kiriti Roy has hooked up with MS Grouchy. What about you? What does that mean? I think I'll wind up some work quickly. I'll just come. Sorry to bother you madam. Mallika. Are you Mallika? No. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You're a Bengali, right? - Yes. Actually there's so much of resemblance.. ..that I couldn't resist myself. Holiday? Yes. With family? Not really. Then what really? I teach in a school here. Oh, excellent. A teacher? In Darjeeling? Well, I'm an extremely good student.. .. in case you want to check me out. May I invite you to a good cup of Darjeeling tea? Ashim is doing quite well in the charitable home.' I've heard Hari and Keya have had two more children.' Shekhar has shut down his father's umbrella showroom..' ..and started a music studio by hid father's name.' 'And me.' Rabi Chatterjee's words were proved true at the end.' 'I didn't do well with people.' So, I moved away from people and chose something else.' 'Cinema.' 'I've written the script for a movie..' '..and I'm looking for a producer now.' The story that you've been watching patiently so far..' ..is the one. The blueprint of my movie's script.' I'm not meant to be a doctor. And you, you'll need to grow your hair long.. ..if you want to be a singer. Don't talk rubbish. - Of course. You want to say that long hair makes a good singer. Hair, this long.. Ask Shekhar to grow his brains. It'll help him. Here, tell this item, not me. Listen to me. The point is we need adventure. Why are you telling me? Hey, why are you fighting? There are other ways to find adventure. Quiet, quiet. Okay, now listen to me. Come on, move. Move on. May I say something? I'm losing my temper now. - What temper? I have a business idea in my head. All my dreams are fading away one by one. A confused cry in the middle of the night. Where's the Robinson Crusoe from my childhood lost? Who'd come to me all of a sudden and say. Come, let's go. Tom Sawyer beckoned me every now and then. A leap to the moonlit hill with Bibhuti Bhushan. Today, there's no one to beckon me as I sit alone by the window. Only my songs call out to you. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go.
