Open sesame. Close down. Come on, let's leave. Let's go. Aflatoon, hide Marjina somewhere very quickly. I'll hide her. Hide inside this box. In this box? - Yes, in this box. Don't worry. This is my magic box. It's of help during difficult times. Come on, hide inside quickly. But she will be breathless inside. She won't be. Arrangement for both air and light is made inside it. I'll kill you. My lord. - Move. Gohra. Gohra. You idiot. Shut up. Listen. Loot everything and put the tent on fire. Hurry up. Jeevan, there's a skeleton inside it. Leave it here. Let's go. Run. Marjina. Those vile people killed my parents. I'll kill them. Marjina. Don't be foolish. Leave me. - If you go, they will arrest you. Let me go. I'll definitely exact revenge against him. Let me go. Let me go. Alibaba, you always provide alms to the poor. God will make you prosperous. Stay healthy and happy. Not me, bless my brother. I'm giving away alms to celebrate his marriage. Master, God willing, you too, like Mir Kasim. . . .will marry a beautiful girl. Of course. God willing junior master should have four wives. There should be a line up of daughters-in-law in the house. Gulbadan, not even a single one is there yet. But you are dreaming about four? Go bring some more money from aunt Razia. No. You better go yourself. She will reprimand me. I'll go myself. Bless you. - Bless you. While Mir Kasim holds every penny close to him. . . .this boy gives away generously. Aunt, I feel like giving more alms. Please give me some more coins. You can give alms afterwards. The marriage ritual will start soon. Yes, first, see how your sister-in-law looks. Yes, I'd almost forgotten. Let's go. - Let's go. Not yet. First, the groom will see her. Bride, please remove your veil and look in the plate. Wow. It seems a golden lotus has blossomed in a silver plate. Oh, God. Oh, God. Groom, now, you look. Don't be shy, Brother. Look like this. Hey, why are you bending and looking? First, let the groom look at his bride. Please look at her. Have you seen, Brother? Bride, have you too seen him? Now, I'll look at my sister-in-law as long as I like. Brother, my sister-in-law is a fairy from heaven. Congratulations, Brother. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Sister-in-law. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm removing the dagger from your drape. The drape is lifeless. It will not get hurt with the dagger. But she is getting hurt who is injured with the arrow of your love. First, remove that arrow, Ali. Sister-in-law. Not sister-in-law, call me as your beloved. With just one glance, you've made me your slave. Sister-in-law. Don't move away from me, Ali. Look at the love oozing out of my eyes. It wants to kiss your lips and touch you. Ali, look at my enchanting hair. It wants to cover you fully with its beauty. No. No, no. You are my mother. And no son. . Don't mock my feelings by calling me your mother, Ali. I'm younger to you. But you are elder to me in relationship. Ali, don't be stubborn and make a mistake. . . .which you'll regret for your lifetime. Come and hug me. Let go of me. Leave me. What are you doing, Ali? At least think about your brother. Leave me, let me go. Leave me. My lord. My lord. - What happened, dear? Ask about it to this to this vile person. . . .who removed my drape when he saw me alone in the garden. And then he tried to molest me. You traitor. I raised you with so much affection. But you've hurt me when you became a young man? Brother, sister-in-law is lying. What did you say? I'm lying? You are looking at everything, yet you are being silent? Dear, don't start a fire which will destroy this family. Don't spread a fire of hatred. . . .which will make a bother go after his brother's blood. He is not brother, he is my enemy. He has tried to molest my wife in front of me. Sometimes you fall prey to misunderstanding, Kasim. I've complete faith in Ali. He stakes his own life for the honour of others. How can he try to dishonour his own family? You should not take sides unjustly. Ali, go away from here. Otherwise I'll get angry and ruin you. You are repaying your brother's affection in this manner? Is this the way you are honouring your father's legacy? In just two days your wife has made such a magic. . . .that you are thinking of your family members as outsiders? Very good. This is how you do justice? Instead of punishing your wayward brother. . . .you are taunting me? I'm so unfortunate that I'm married into this family. Otherwise would anybody have dared to. . . . malign my morality in this manner? No. Dear, your morality is pure and spotless like a flower of rose. Sister Razia has made a mistake in understanding you. I had understood her when I saw her dissatisfied. . . .after watching your face on the day of the marriage. Oh. Now, this witch has begun to hurl allegations at me? Mind your tongue, Sister-in-law. I can tolerate insult to me. . . . but I can never tolerate insult to my elder sister. Listen to me, now either these people stay in this house or me. If you want to keep them here, send me back to my parents now. Dear. Dear. Where are you going, dear? We'll go ourselves. Now, there's no place in this house for us. Lady, how can I stay in the house which has no place for you? I had taken shelter with you during my childhood. Now, I'll go away from you only after my death. Okay, go and bring our belongings. Okay. - Wait, Gulbadan. I'll also come. Yes. I warn you not to touch anything from here. Whatever that is here is mine. What do you say? - Yes, okay. Chief guard, remove all their jewellery and precious clothing. Move away. Don't forget your limit. No, Ali. Throw away the sword. Now, I detest even a penny of this house. Let's go, Ali. ''I'm innocent, my heart is innocent. '' ''My heart is innocent, I'm innocent. '' ''When the eyes meet. . '' ''What's going to happen?'' ''What's going to happen?'' ''I'm innocent, my heart is innocent. '' ''My heart is innocent, I'm innocent. '' ''When the eyes meet. . '' ''What's going to happen?'' ''What's going to happen?''

Oh, God. '' ''The heart is very strange. '' ''It doesn't know the secret of its heartbeat. '' ''It doesn't know. '' ''I'm innocent, my heart is innocent. '' ''My heart is innocent, I'm innocent.

'' ''When the eyes meet eyes. . '' ''What's going to happen?'' ''What's going to happen?'' Wow. - Very good. Very good. It was great enjoyment. I feel the intoxication of the wine. Very good. - Wow. Please listen, just now you've heard the lyrical song of Mynah (bird). Now, listen to the shrieks of this wild crow. Thank you very much for appreciating me. But empty praise won't be enough. I've given you joy with my job. You give me joy with your money. Please. Thank you very much. God bless you. May God make you the father of 20 children. May God make you prosperous. Thank you very much. It is really heartening. Please give me. Bless you. Please be kind, be appreciative. Not in the gathering of beggars. You will be appreciated in the palaces of the rich. If you wish, come to my master Kasim's palace. You'll enjoy great leisure there. You are forgetting that I do not dance for leisure. I dance to feed myself. Enjoy the money of your master yourself. We are happy doing our work. Hey, beauty. You don't know whose invitation you are refusing. Just one gesture from me. . . .can make you rub your nose on the ground. My foot! I am not afraid of anybody. Perfectly right. She doesn't even fear me. In spite of the fact that my name is Aflatoon. Soldiers. Aflatoon. Arrest this arrogant woman and take her to the Mir Kasim's palace. Please don't. . - Where are you taking us? Run. Let's run. Aflatoon. Aflatoon. Run from there. Run. You've done wonders, Uncle Mustafa. I feel like kissing your hand. Only hand? Because you've sewn this clothing so well. . . .that my madam will not have any doubt at all. . . .that this clothing had gotten torn at my hands. This is just clothing. If you mistakenly cur somebody's throat. . . .I can sew him so well that. . . .even the great surgeons will not find out anything. All right. Tell me how much do I've to pay? Payment? Why do you embarrass me? I received my payment when you liked it. Uncle Mustafa, you are so nice. All right. Now, let me take your leave. When will you return? When the cloth gets torn. The cloth can get torn everyday. You tear it, I'll sew it. You tear it, I'll sew it. Uncle Mustafa. Oh, God. Thief. Thief. Thief. - Thief. Thief. Thief. Thief. Thief. - Thief. There he is, sir. - Lets run. Come on. Thief. Guards, catch them. They should not run away. Run. Come here. Ill-mannered girl. You have tried to dishonour my master. Now, you'll face the consequences. You are hitting a woman, though you are a man. Don't you feel ashamed? Shameless. Marjina. Friends, you are just watching the drama here? Isn't there any brave man in this city who can stop this man? Nobody is born as yet who can stop Jaffer. Who is this arrogant man? Have you forgotten so soon? Who? Alibaba? Let these helpless people go. My master is Mir Kasim. Nobody else can order me. There is a bigger master present than Mir Kasim. He is God. He doesn't allow atrocities against innocent people. Don't talk rubbish. . Guards. Hey. What are you doing? Shut up. - Shut up. Shut up. - Shut up. Hit them. Oh, my God. He's coming. What are you doing? Get up. Cowards have run away. Take this. Give it to them when they return. Great. I've seen many warriors. But I had not seen such a dynamic swordsman before. You have shown such a great skill. I'll never forget your favour. If you had not arrived. . . .these vile people would have taken me to Mir Kasim's palace. Not a human being, you're an angel. Thank you. I don't like to listen to flattery. Especially of women. Why? What is bad about women? God save me from the treachery of women. I have no faith in any beautiful girl in the world. He has no faith in any woman. Arrogant man. Who was this madman? He looks like a crazy man. Mister, do you know him? Who doesn't know about him? He is Mir Kasim's immoral brother. Immoral? - Yes, that's why Mir Kasim threw him out of his house. So strange. I think this whole city is strange. Madhouse. Marjina, we better go away from here. Come on. Marjina. The trouble is once again approaching us. Let's run. Marjina, he is the same Alibaba. Let's plead to him. He'll give us shelter. No. No. I don't like to take shelter from such an arrogant man. Ali. Look. He said he doesn't have faith in any woman. I hate him. Alas, a girl hates me in this manner. What do you mean? - I mean. . Come with me. I mean the soldiers. . Come on, run. Run. Leave my hand. Leave me. Please open the door. Marjina, you'll die and get me killed too. Look there. . No, I won't come. - Alibaba. Alibaba. - Let me go. Marjina, the soldiers are coming from there. Please open the door. Come inside. - Let me go. How come you've come here? Kasim's soldiers are following us once again. Come with me. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Oh, God. Ghost! Ghost! Brother, please stop. They have run away. All of them have run away. Cowards. I have crushed all of them. I chased all of them away. Luckily, I was with him. Aflatoon, let's go from here. But please listen. . Stop. What's the hurry? He looks very innocent. Just like me. I think we should stay as guests for a few days. What do you think? - No. I won't stay here even for a moment. - Why? A woman cannot have faith in the man. . . .who doesn't have faith in women. Let's go. - Of course you may go. Who is stopping you? If you want, I'll open the door for you. Please don't get upset. Please listen. I say, move away. You may go if you want to go. Alibaba. What's the matter? Nothing, Sister. Sister? Who are they? I don't know. I saved them from our brother's soldiers. But she is being so arrogant. She says she doesn't have faith in men. I said she can certainly go. I'll open the door. You are ill-mannered. Does anybody behave in this manner with guests? Sister, what's the hurry? It would not be proper for you to go out now. Perhaps, they will harass you once again. Gulbadan. Oh, Gulbadan. I'm coming. I'm coming. Why are you walking so briskly? Please be cautious while walking. Who are you, mister? Gulbadan. - Yes. They are our guests. Please prepare snacks for them quickly. Yes. - Miss, please listen. Why do you trouble her? I can prepare nice snacks. Where is the kitchen? Oh, God. Will you work in kitchen even though you are a man? You are talking about kitchen? I've prepared dishes in Basra for years. You must have done it. Your face says it all. Madam, he seems to be a useful guest. Should I make him work in the kitchen? Shut up. Does anybody ask a guest to work in kitchen? All right. Bring grocery from the market. I'll prepare it myself. - Okay. Please stop. Stop. I too will go to market with you. You buy the grocery. I'll carry it here. Aflatoon, what's wrong with you? Has anything gone wrong with me? Yes, you've gone mad. You don't understand. I want to do some work. If you want to work and get food, take this. Come with me. I'm going to the jungle to cut wood. Take it. Let's go. - I'm in trouble. Hey. Why are you coming here? Your path is from that side. Mine is this side. Do you understand? I'll die. Alibaba, my back. . My back. . You are a strange person. What have you done? How would I know how to cut the wood? I'm not a woodcutter. Do you think I am? - When did I say so? Alibaba donkey. . I mean that donkey. It is running away. All right. Take those chopped wood pieces home. Okay? I'll catch it. He is saying I should carry the chopped donkeys on the wood. As if I'm his servant. Stop. Hey, stop. Oh. Oh. You donkey. Finally I've caught you. You donkey. You are fated to carry loads, kid. Run away as much as you can, the fate will not let you go. Open sesame. Partners. The caravan coming from Baghdad has reached Nazla. We'll not get a better chance to attack them than now. Close sesame. Come on. Open sesame. Close sesame? Oh, God. What secret is this? Come on. Open sesame. Close sesame. Oh, God. There is such a vast treasure here. Wow. My God. You are glorious. You are great benefactor. You've given me so much in this cave. Wow. Hey. Why are you sniffing it? Kid, you should not get tempted too much. Eat only as much as you can digest. Otherwise, you'll lose whatever you've got. Do you understand? Come on. Come on. Come on. Sister. Sister. Sister. . Oh, you are here? Where is sister? In the kitchen. Aflatoon. - Yes. Bring these bags inside. - Right away. It is so heavy. Alibaba, you are back? Why did you get so delayed today? Sister, I'll tell you later. First, give me something to eat. I'm very hungry. Wow. Great. What tasty food ! It seems I'm eating food from paradise. No doubt about it. I wish to kiss the hand of the cook. No, not mine, kiss Marjina's hand. She has cooked. Why are you just sitting here? Open it quickly. - I'm opening it. He is giving me orders. What dirt has he brought in these sacks? Look at this. Gold coins, jewellery. . Where have you brought this from? It seems master has carried out a robbery. Tell me the truth, Ali. Where did you get all this wealth from? Has poverty made you so dishonest? Sister, Ali can never become dishonest. . . .as long as I'm under your shelter. All this is God's gift. If this is God's gift, God should give you more. I think these guests are auspicious. As soon as they came in this house, we have received wealth. I'm the philosopher's stone. Whatever I touch turns into gold. But you are a stone yourself. You are a liar. Gulbadan, don't insult me on every matter. I don't like it at all. Do you understand? You talk like that. Can anybody be turned into gold if one touches somebody? So, am I lying? What else if not a liar? You've touched me so many times. But let alone gold, I haven't turned even into any metal. It's because I did not make you so deliberately. If I had turned you into gold, how could I have married a gold idol? Don't be under such an illusion. If you want to marry me, acquire wealth like my master Alibaba. Otherwise forget it. I'll not marry any pauper. Do you understand? Pauper? - Yes. - Is that so? Then I'll marry you only after I acquire wealth. I too have been thinking on those lines since a few days. It's not proper to keep you as guest here for too long. So. . let me take your leave. How can I let you go? I wish you should become a lady in the house. . . . instead of a guest. And I should stay as your guest. What. . I don't understand. I mean, God has sent Ali's bride in my house. I'll not reject God's gift. Now, you can think of this house as your own. Sister. ''The one who comes in dreams. '' ''You are God of my dreams. '' ''Alibaba. Alibaba. Alibaba. '' ''Alibaba. Alibaba. Alibaba. '' ''I've filled your love in my heart. '' ''I've filled your love in my heart. '' ''I've built a new world.

If anyone gets the wealth of the whole world won't he be happy? So, has master given you his entire wealth? - No. He's upset with me, isn't he? - Not only you. Except for sister Razia he's upset with all the women in the world. Okay, Gulbadan. If sister Razia tells him. . . .that he shouldn't be upset with one woman. . . .will he agree? - Oh, that's a tricky question. Master's here. I'll go and ask him right away. - No. Gulbadan. Hey, Gulbadan. Listen. No, Sister. I'll ask master right away. - Hey. - Oh. Go ahead. What do you want to ask? - Master, I? Not me. Sister was saying that. . - No, I wasn't saying anything. I didn't say anything. - Oh, Sister. You were saying just now. . - Actually, I was saying. . . .I was saying. . I was saying that this house is very old. Why don't we renovate it? - Well done, Sister. You just changed the whole topic. - Shut up, you liar. Actually, I was talking about this house. Don't worry, Marjina. This house will be renovated soon. Everything in this house will be renovated. Servants, maids. . - So, will you fire me and hire a new maid? Not at all. There'll be a lot of maids in this house. And you'll be their senior maid. - Senior maid. And me? - You? Marjina, you're an excellent cook. That's why I'll make you the kitchen in-charge. Kitchen in-charge? That's it? Hey. Marjina. My dear donkey, my lovely donkey. . . . like me, even you must have fallen in love with a jenny. And you must even be knowing. . . .that in love both man and donkey, donkey and man. . . . become useless. You know it, don't you? Jolly good. You're an intelligent donkey. Look, if I didn't get wealth, Gulbadan won't marry me. So, my friend, my brother, my father. . . .show me the way to the treasure like Alibaba. Come on, Buddy. Please, take me to treasure. Come on. Please, take me there. There you go. There you go. Brother. Listen. Even I'm coming. Let's move towards the treasure. Brother. Listen. Where are you running away? What's the matter, donkey, my brother? Is the treasure over here? Is it inside this wall? Well, my work's done. God bless you. I'll just dig it out of this wall. ''I'm innocent. My heart is innocent.

Destiny has held it. Wow, such a delicate and soft hand. Oh, my beautiful destiny. Keep holding my hand like this for the rest of my life. Don't leave it ever. Yes, I won't leave your hand even when I die, you idiot. Sweetheart, I've caught a thief. Come fast. Thief. Thief. - Thief? Thief? Oh, my God. My hand. You've twisted my hand, you fool. Come fast, Sweetheart. My hand. Oh, God. My hand. What happened, Darling? What happened? - Thief! My hand. Whose hand is it? - It's the thief's hand. Okay, keep holding it. I'll catch the thief right away. I'll keep holding him. - You don't leave him. Hurry up, Sweetheart. This idiot's getting away. I'm holding his hand. Hurry up. All right, Darling. Leave his hand. I've caught the thief. - Oh, Mr. Muscle Man. Swear to your beard. I'm not a thief. It's all that foolish donkey's fault. . . .who fooled me and brought me here. You're the one who's fooling us, you idiot. Give it to me. Does it belong to your father? - Forgive me, Mother. You call a young girl like me ''Mother?'' - Sister. Do you think I'll become your sister? Curses on you. I'll colour your face black, make you sit on a donkey. . . .and make you ride on it throughout the whole city. Break his bones. Crush his each and every bone. What happened? - What happened? He stole my diamond necklace. Beat him up. Beat him. - Beat him. Hit him hard. Now, for your final treatment. . A flower garland.

I've heard that Ali has made such a huge house. . . .that the whole city's talking about him. And there's no limit to his wealth at all. But how can it be possible, Darling? God knows how it happened. I'm getting restless since the time I've heard about it. But we threw him out of the house. . . .without giving him a single penny. - So what? The one who has been thrown out can even be called back. Darling, is it you who's saying that? - Why? What's the problem in it? - He has attempted rape on you. He has tried to ruin your honour. Everyone does it in youth. Look at yourself. You're above 40. But you still start drooling looking at other women. Isn't it? - Yes. And I'm not telling you to call him forever, am I? Then? - Come here. Have a seat. Got it. - Oh, swear to God, Darling. There's no match for your shrewdness. I'll send Ali an invitation today itself. ''The emotions of my heart and the joy of love. .

'' Wonderful. What fun ! Did you like it, Ali? What was the need to take this trouble, Brother? I got you, I got the happiness of the whole world. Yes, I haven't even met you properly yet. Ali, come with me. I need to tell a lot of things. Hear a lot of things from you. Come. Come here. I know you're very upset with me, Ali. I've been unjust to you by throwing you out of the house. You haven't been unjust to me, Brother. You've done a favour to me. If you wouldn't have thrown me out of the house. . . . perhaps, I would never have become self-dependent. Perhaps, you are, Brother. I'm trapped in the cage of wealth. But no. Now I'll get rid of this wealth. Look. Half of all the wealth over here is yours. But you can take all of it if you want. - Thank you, Brother. I don't need your wealth. - I know you have a lot of wealth. But I don't want Mir Kasim's brother. . . .to have illegitimate wealth. So, you distribute all that wealth among the poor. . . .and take this legitimate wealth to your house. You're misunderstanding, Brother. I don't have illegitimate wealth. - Then. . Then how did so much wealth come to you suddenly? I. .I can't tell you, Brother. You think I'm an outsider. That's why, isn't it? What are you saying, Brother? I'm telling you exactly what I've been through, Brother. The lion moved forward from that side. I moved forward from this side. He jumped from that side. I jumped from this side. He went above me and I went below him. You fool. Good for nothing. - Forgive me, Sire. I just got excited and thought that you're that lion. But you're a jackal. What? - No, Sire. I made a mistake. You're getting me absolutely wrong, Brother. I don't have anything against you in my heart at all. It's all just for the sake of saying, Ali. If you didn't have anything against me. . . .why would you hide such an ordinary thing from me? You definitely think that I'm still your enemy. I'm telling you the truth, Sister. Since the time you've left this house. . . . happiness has gone away from this house. Hey, where are you going? - Nothing. I'm feeling thirsty. So, why are you taking trouble? Have a seat. Sit over here. I'll bring some sorbet for all of you. I'm afraid. What if Kasim talks sweetly to him. . . .and gets the secret of the treasure from him? Even I sense something suspicious. You go first. - I'm not thirsty at all. Oh, don't be stubborn. If you're getting so stubborn, then all right. Listen. But for God's sake, don't tell it to anyone, Brother. You're suspecting me again. Am I your enemy? Say it in my ear if you're afraid. Open sesame. Close sesame. That's it. My work's done. A brother should be like you. Come with me. But. . - Stop him. Careful. I'll get hurt. Be careful. Jaffer. Take my brother under arrest with all due respect. Soldiers. Brother, I couldn't imagine even in my wildest dreams. . . .that you'll betray me like this. - Quiet. Take him away.
