See the sea lions? Some of them have cancer, and I think it's the water that's causing it. - How is the sea water giving the sea lions cancer? - It's too acidic. It's harming the marine life. - How? - Well, there's too much CO2 in the water, caused by global warming, climate change. - Damn global warming. - Recently, the news has been reporting that there have been a lot of collisions between the whales and the cargo ships. It's not the whole story. They're actually dying because of cancer because of the ocean acidification. That's why one of them washed up on shore. - That's tragic. I'm Evan, by the way. - Kim. - So nice talking to you, Kim. So I take it you're a biologist, then? - Marine biologist. - Awesome, I'm actually a scientist too. I study aging. I'm a gerontologist. - That's interesting. - Yeah. Any chance you'd wanna go up to the pier, maybe grab a bite to eat? We can talk more about how the sea water's becoming too acidic. - I'm really busy with my research. - Oh, come on. You're a scientist trying to save marine life, and I'm a scientist trying to discover how to extend the human life expectancy. We could have a lot to learn from each other. - Okay. - Cool, let's do it. (somber music) - [Narrator] At present, the human race is facing an existential crisis. It is the greatest threat to life on Earth, climate change. What we do now, and in the next 10 years, will significantly affect the future of life on Earth. The normal weather condition we have experienced are changing, and changing rapidly. For thousands of years, the weather condition has been predictable and stable to support life on Earth. (tense music) Now, in a span of 100 years, indeed in the space of one human lifetime, the extinction of life on Earth is a reality. The Holocene has faded. The Garden of Eden is gone. What we do now, and in the next 10 years, will determine the survival of human civilization. It is the extinction of life on Earth if we don't take action now. (intense music) If we work together, we can find the solutions to fix global warming. (haunting choral music) We can use carbon removal technology to remove and reduce CO2 emissions. And we have to stop using fossil fuels to power our industrial civilization. We can have a world with clean air and water, renewable energy, and food that can keep us healthy. But to make that happen, we need a plan. The climate is changing fast, and can lead to extinction. (pleasant music) (wings flapping) - Hi. - I'm really glad you came. - Yeah, thank you for having me. Wow, they're beautiful. - Shall we go sit? - Of course. See this? - Yes. - It's a water acidity chart. The higher the pH, the more acid in the water. And recently, the acidity levels in the ocean have been rising. That's why the sea lions and whales are getting cancer and dying. - Damn, we have to do something about this damned global warming. - Yeah, but enough about my work. You said you study aging? - Yeah, I study aging. Did you know there's actually nine mechanisms of aging? - No. - Actually 724 trillion cells in the human body. - That's a lot. - Yeah, there's more cells in the human body than there are galaxies in the universe. - Wow. - Yeah, as we age, cells begin to wear out, and there's wear and tear on the DNA, and it's damaged. And that's why we develop gray hair, wrinkly skin, and memory loss, as well as age-related diseases like Alzheimer's, macular degeneration, cancer, and stroke. That's why I'm doing research on the nine mechanisms of aging, so that we can slow them down using supplements and medicine, so that way people can look younger, be younger, and live longer. What really got me into the study of aging was when my grandmother passed away from Alzheimer's, an age-related disease. It was really hard to watch, because I was so young, and I just had to watch it happen, and there was nothing that I could do, at all. And, that's when I vowed to study aging when I grew up, so that I can develop these supplements so that people, even when they go to 70 and on, will have a really great life without these age-related diseases. - I'm so sorry to hear about your grandmother. So what's your advice to live longer? - Well, I would say eating less. Your body is kinda like a car, and the more you use your car, the more there's wear and tear on it, like the tires and so on. As well as having a nice, healthy diet. - So what's a healthy diet? - I would say eating like 90% vegetables, as well as eating fruits, and maybe white meats like chicken. - What's your other advice? - Another thing would be staying away from those sugary foods, and sugary drinks. I would say having a meaningful purpose in life, and lots of exercise really helps out. - That's great advice. - Yeah, and not that you need it now, but as you age, and get to around 40, you'll wanna take Longevity and Rejuvenate, two supplements started by my biotech startup, Immortal Therapeutics. They really combat the nine mechanisms of aging, and help you stay younger for long. - Think I'm gonna do that. - Definitely. - So what do you like to do outside of work? - I love movies. - Really, what's your favorite film? - Hm, Vertigo. - That's a coincidence, that's my favorite movie too. - Really? - Yeah, what's your favorite scene? - My favorite scene has to be when Scottie stalks Judy to the Empire Hotel, and follows her up to her room, and then they talk. - I like the scene in San Juan Bautista. - Oh, really? I was going down Highway 101 last week, and I had to stop and get gas at a gas station in San Juan Bautista, next to the freeway. And I was looking around, and it looked just like how when it was produced in the film Vertigo, so I had to take the tour. - Does it still look like it did when they filmed Vertigo? - It looks almost exactly like it did when they filmed Vertigo in 1958, except there's one thing that was there that isn't there now. - Really, what is it? - Well, you'll have to come with me to San Juan Bautista to find out. - Come on, I'm dying to know. (tender music) (upbeat music) - [Protester] No more fossil fuels! - Protect our environment! No genocides. - Don't let the world die! - People don't have to die! - The world does not have to end. - Protect her future. - No mass extinctions. - No fossil fuels, no fossil fuels! - Extinction insurrection. - Extinction insurrection! - No more. - Climate emergency! - No more fossil fuels! - No genocide! - Extinction insurrection! - People don't have to die. - No genocide. - Climate emergency! - People don't have to die. The world does not have to end. - Extinction insurrection. - No more fossil fuels! - Protect our future! - Woo, protect our future! - Please protect my future. - No more fossil fuels. Extinction insurrection. - Please protect our future. - [Protester] No more fossil fuels. No genocide. - Protect our future! - Extinction insurrection. - I want my daughter to grow up in a world where she can breathe the air, and have clean water. - [Protester] The world doesn't have to end. - Protect her future. - Extinction insurrection. No more fossil fuels. - I refuse to let my daughter, any of our children, breathe the poisonous gases from this wildfire. - [Protester] The world doesn't have to end. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. - Protect our children, and let them see a sky that is blue, and not orange from the wildfire. This is climate change. - No mass extinction. - Protect our children. Protect their future. - Climate emergency. The world doesn't have to end. - Extinction insurrection! - We can do this together! - Extinction insurrection! Extinction insurrection! Extinction insurrection! - Extinction insurrection! - [Protesters] Extinction insurrection! Extinction insurrection! Extinction insurrection! No one has to die! - Please protect my future! - Protect her future! - Protect her future! - Fuels! - Extinction insurrection! - Extinction insurrection! - No more! - Climate emergency! - No more fossil fuels! - No genocide! - Extinction insurrection! - People don't have to die. - No genocide! - Climate emergency! - People don't have to die. The world does not have to end. - Extinction insurrection! - No more fossil fuels! - Protect our future! - Woo, protect our future! No more fossil fuels! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - That's wonderful. Kinda reminds me of a Van Gogh painting. - Thanks, I love to paint. Van Gogh is my inspiration. I have to capture the beauty of this place before it's all gone. - Why do you say that? - Remember last year, when the sky turned from blue to orange, because of all the wildfires? I don't want to paint the orange sky. - What kind of bird is it? - It's a sea eagle. - I didn't know there were sea eagles in this area. - They're from Southeast Asia, Vietnam, and Australia. At least, that's what Dr. Jones said. - Who's Dr. Jones? - He's a bird expert and ornithologist. He was here to study why the sea eagles have come to Santa Cruz, and he pointed to a flock of sea eagles, and they looked magnificent, so I decided to paint the sea eagles. He was a little worried, though, about the sea eagles being in Santa Cruz, 'cause in 2008, a flock of golden eagles had attacked a small town of Half Moon Bay. - No way, did he say why? - No, he didn't. He didn't say why. (waves crashing) (underwater splashing) (waves crashing) - Shark, shark! Shark! - Are you okay? - God, no, no, a shark just bit off my hand, man. It nearly bit it off! - Are you injured, do we need to call 911? - No. No, no need to call an ambulance. - Sharks though? - Yes. Well, okay, a few years ago, it was very rare to find sharks in the Santa Cruz ocean, right? Okay, but now 'cause of global warming, and climate change, you know, the sea warmed and now they're out there. But now it's like every time I surf, it's like I'm playing Russian roulette with sharks. - That's awful! - Yeah, it's like I'm seriously considering quitting surfing, it's just, it's too dangerous, you know? (surfer sighs) All right, guys. Stay safe, okay? (waves crashing) - Nice house. - Thanks, I sell houses. I'm an agent. - Really? I'm actually looking to buy a house. - Okay, in that case, let me give you my card. - Thank you. Million Dollar House Realty. Are all the houses you sell really valued at at least a million dollars? - Absolutely, the price of houses are going through the roof. Even the price of a condo costs more than a million dollars in the San Francisco Bay Area. - Wow, well I'm looking for a three bedroom home, surrounded by trees, preferably in a forest. - Okay. Are you sure you really want a house that's surrounded by trees in the forest? - Yeah, what's wrong with trees? - Trees absorb CO2, they're good for the environment. - Well, usually I just find that dream house for my clients. I'm not obligated beyond that, and I mind my own business, and I collect my big fat sales commission. (realtor chuckles) But you look like a nice guy, a nice couple, so I'm gonna give you some advice to help save your house. Remember that small town called Paradise where a wildfire came through and burned down the whole city, and all the houses, a few years ago? - Yes. - Well, that town was and is surrounded by trees and forest. Then the wildfire came, and burned down all the houses. The trees were so dry they were ready to burn like matchsticks or firewood. And then they were all gone. - Why were the trees so dry? - Global warming, climate change. It's screwing up real estate business. It's screwing up the whole planet. - It's awful. (pleasant music) See with Rejuvenate, you could look younger, be younger, and live longer, because Rejuvenate restores cells, and also repairs damaged cells. Even more so, Rejuvenate really slows down those nine mechanisms of aging. - Yes, absolutely. I could sure use some Rejuvenate. After all, I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get some for my mother, too, because she suffers from arthritis. - Well, we could definitely do that. That would be great. - So, Evan tell me, what kind of money are we talking about here? - So, we are talking about roughly $10 million. - 10 mil (whistles) well, that's a lot of moolah. But like I said, I'm not getting any younger, and neither is my mother. But anyway, the world needs Rejuvenate now, so you got it, man. You're gonna get your 10 mil. (upbeat music) - Fantastic! Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, sir. - Congratulations. You're the man. - Yes, sir. - Yep, we're going to do some great work together. - Yes we are. - So, you take care. I'll talk to you soon. - Talk to you soon, sir. - Okay, bye-bye. (soothing music) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) - Very nice car. - Thank you, I just got it, directly from the Ferrari factory in Italy. - Very nice. - I really think you're gonna like this house. It's 5,000 square feet, three bedrooms, three baths. It's listed for $2.1 million. - You know, I like it. But there's two small trees out front. And weren't you just telling me I shouldn't get a house surrounded by trees, because of wildfire and global warming? - Yes, I know. But come on, these two small trees, they're not gonna burn down this house. Come on, let's go inside. Let's take a look. - Okay. (birds chirping) - Okay, here we have the main living room. As you can see, plenty of windows and natural lighting. - This is a very unique painting. - Yes it is. It's called "Orange Sky." It was inspired by the wildfires from last year, which turned this color of the sky from blue to orange. The owner, seller of this house is a climate scientist. He was so shocked to see the color of the sky turn orange that he had this painting commissioned. - The orange sky looks like hell. - Agreed. Over here, this painting is called "Burning Tree." Wildfires burned hundreds of millions of trees, releasing even more CO2 into the atmosphere. - So tragic. - Yeah. This painting here is called "Melting Ice," which depicts melting ice in the Arctic, and Antarctica, due to global warming. The owner told me that the ice in the Arctic and Antarctica serve as the Earth's natural air conditioners. The ice helps to keep the planet Earth cool, and at a normal temperature. He said that when the ice is all gone and melted, we're toast. (somber music) (whale spout hisses) (gulls cawing) (whale spout hisses) - Wow. - Yeah. This whale at the ripe old age of 50, died from natural causes. It's too bad today's whales won't live that long. They're gonna die of cancer due to ocean acidification. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - Awesome looking whale skeleton. - Yeah. - I think I know who you are. You are Mr. Green, founder of Pay Me, Odyssey Space Line, and the Green Car Company. You're like the richest man in the world. - Yes, it's me. - You know, I love my Tesla Model 3, but my next car definitely has to be the Green E, because it's fast, it looks great, and it has twice the mileage range as a Tesla Model 3, and it's only $20,000. - Hope you get a Green car. - [Evan] Definitely. - Well, we'd better fix global warming, or else the human race will wind up like this whale skeleton. - I completely agree, but how are we gonna fix global warming? - It's a good question, and I think I can fix it. Even if there was zero CO2 emissions now, in every country, the whole planet? It will not solve global warming, because, since the industrial revolution over 100 years ago, over 1,000 gigatons of CO2 has been released into the Earth's atmosphere. This massive amount of CO2 will continue to raise Earth's temperatures with all the harms of global warming. We are at a point now, according to a United Nations report, it's code red for humanity and civilization. - It's so tragic. - So that's why I started a company called Code Red Technology, to fix global warming. I'm funding it with a few billion dollars to build a space elevator that goes from the ground to the Earth's atmosphere, about 62 miles. This space elevator is a large tube and cable that is built from graphene carbon nanotechnology material. That's very strong, can withstand anything. My Code Red space elevator will be used to transport cargo, and people, to space. Hey, I'm gonna disrupt the space business by making it cheap, and affordable to travel and access space for everyone. And, it will be used to pump the CO2 out of the Earth's atmosphere. Here's how it works. My Code Red space elevator removes the CO2 out of the Earth's atmosphere, and sends it into space. Global warming is fixed. - That's incredible. - Hm, yes. And Mr. Green? If you're successful with this Code Red space elevator, you're not only gonna be a trillionaire, and win a Nobel Prize, but you will have done a great thing for humanity. - Thank you. Even if my space elevator does not remove enough CO2 out of the Earth's atmosphere, and the planet goes up in smoke, my space elevator will transport the human race into space, where there will be colonies in space near Earth's orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond. (birds chirping) (soothing music) (birds chirping) - Hello, here's your wine. - Did you know that this was the vacation home for the great director, Mr. Alfred Hitchcock? And it was here where he was inspired to make his films, "The Birds" and "Vertigo?" - Really? - Yes, and in 1961 a flock of seagulls attacked a group of people in Santa Cruz, and it was reported in a local newspaper, "The Santa Cruz Sentinel." Well, Mr. Hitchcock read that article, and it inspired him to produce and direct "The Birds." - Interesting, I didn't know that. - Yes, it was also here where he was inspired to film in locations like San Francisco, and San Juan Bautista, where he filmed his greatest movie, "Vertigo." - It's actually not just Hitchcock's greatest movie. According to a 2012 survey by the influential "Sight and Sound" magazine, the film industry, movie critics, and academics voted "Vertigo" the greatest film of all time, surpassing "Citizen Kane." - Wow. (rain pattering) (birds chirping) They look like they're having a lot of fun. - Yeah. (zipline whirring) - They're standing, walking, and flying with the trees, before the trees are all gone. (zipline whirring) - Last week, birds, specifically the sea eagle, was seen at the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk. Local residents and tourists were concerned for their safety as the sea eagle flew too close to the boardwalk. Scientists are researching just how the sea eagle came to Santa Cruz from Southeast Asia, Vietnam, and Australia. Cal Fire has reported 20 wild fires this year. They also predict to have 10 more by the end of the year. They have also stated that they are out of funding. In other news, Dr. Richard McLoughlin, a climate scientist from San Francisco, has given a dire warning about climate change. He predicts the human race is headed toward abrupt mass extinction, and the world and civilization will end in just a few years, because the industrial civilization has heated the planet Earth to the point of extinction. (pleasant music) - Here's your beer. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Hey, mister. - Yes. - I remember this bus used to be on that side. - You're right, it was on that side. (birds chirping) But of course, that was before the big bird attack, which came in, destroyed the bus and my business. It was a terrible day. Sadly, many people died that day. - The birds attacked? - Yeah, eagles. Eagles, they came by and just crashed into everything. It was a terrible day. I'm a little nervous though, because lately I've seen eagles hovering above the pub, and all over the Half Moon Bay area. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - James Stewart should have never let Kim Novak run to the tower and fall to her death in "Vertigo." - What tower? (birds chirping) - There's no tower. - Well, now you know. The tower was all a Hollywood invention. (dramatic music) I'm not very good at this, and it might sound cliche, but ever since I met you, Kim, it feels like my life has been uplifted. - That's wonderful. I'm glad I can have a positive effect on you. - Yeah, I feel excited. I feel energetic. I even feel optimistic. I feel like I can do anything, like doing the impossible. - Like what? - Like just last week, I successfully raised $10 million in funding for my biotech startup, Immortal Therapeutics. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - So, now that you have all that money, are you gonna buy me a Tesla car? - Sure. And even more, it's been a while since I've been in a relationship. And it just feels really great to be in love again. (tender music) (waves crashing) (wings flapping) Hi. - Oh, hi. - Is that a rose? - Kind of. Looks like a red rose. It's actually a galaxy far away called the Lagoon Nebula. - It's beautiful. - Yes, beautiful just like you. - Well, this rose galaxy is a cosmic beauty. - Did you capture that picture on this tiny telescope? - Yes, I did. - It's amazing. - This rose galaxy is actually two million light years away from the planet Earth. - That far? - Yes, and it's a good thing that this rose galaxy's so far away, so we and this human warming machine can't get to it and screw it up. - Yeah. - Universe has two trillion galaxies, and each galaxy contains billions of stars. The sun is one of 200 billion stars here in the Milky Way galaxy. There are stars, planets, and galaxies out there that I've categorized as cosmic beauty. - Thanks for the quick astronomy lesson. - Planet Earth is a cosmic beauty. To protect life here, civilization, and humanity, we must find a solution to stop global warming. - Yes, absolutely. (waves crashing) - Wine for the lovely couple. - Thank you so much. - Thank you for coming. - Of course. (glasses clink) Kim, I'm in love with you. - Just in love? - I meant to say, I love you. - By love, does that mean you're gonna get me a Tesla? - Yes, I can buy you anything you'd like. I can even take care of you, 'cause when I'm with you, and we're together, I can accomplish anything.

(birds chirping) (eagles screeching) - The birds are back to attack us! (eagles screeching) 12 years ago, they attacked me and Natalie in Half Moon Bay! - Who's Natalie? - A lady I used to know. She decided to go her own way, and we departed as friends. - Better be. (eagles screeching) - Come on, let's go, let's get in before they kill us all! (eagles screeching) (intense rock music) (motorcycles rumbling) (bikers chattering) - Long ride. - Yeah. (bikers chattering) - What are we doing after this, bro? - Let's go to the nearest bar. (bikers chattering) (eagles screeching) (guns firing) (eagles screeching) - [Biker] Oh damn, where's the other ones at? - [Biker] Look out! (eagles screeching) (guns firing) - Kill 'em, kill 'em! - Oh man, I ran out! (eagles screeching) (guns firing) (eagles screeching) (biker groaning) (birds chirping) (insects chirping) - Let's take their guns and defend ourselves against these crazy birds. - Good idea. (birds chirping) (insects chirping) (gun cocks) - Guys, I think this is their car. We should take it and get more aid. - Let's do it. (birds chirping) (insects chirping) (engine whirring) (people chattering) (eagles screeching) (explosion booms) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) - They're all dead, Rod. - She's dead, too. The birds are stressing me out! I need a beer. - Why are the birds attacking? - Gone mad. - Nothing new. I always knew that the birds were coming back to attack us again, because global warming has driven them to extinction. So maybe, they wanna exterminate us before they are extinct. - Well, let's get the hell outta here before they come back. (eagles screeching) (explosion booms) (eagles screeching) (gunfire rattles) (gunfire rattling) - Ah, oh my god! (eagles screeching) (gunfire rattling) (man grunting) (eagles screeching) (man groaning) (eagles screeching) (woman shrieking) (woman groans) (eagles screeching) (gunfire rattling) (birds chirping) (car doors slam) (engine rumbling) - You guys okay? - Yeah. - Why are these birds attacking us? - I knew this was coming. Last year, there was the Santa Cruz lightning complex wildfires that nearly burned everything around here. The fire came within 100 feet of my house, but I used my 100 gallon water tank to extinguish it. Wildfire everywhere, worldwide year round now. And this year, it's the sea eagles attack. And coming soon, you will not even have air to breathe because of the loss of oxygen due to the depletion of plankton in the oceans. We're headed towards abrupt extinction. The human race will cease to exist in a few years. They said I was wrong, on the fringe, a lunatic. They even nicknamed me Dr. Extinction. Well now, the endless wildfire, drought, floods, birds, are now in their face. - I thought the climate scientists said we had 'til 2050. - Don't believe in that fantasy. I'm a climate scientist, professor emeritus, University of San Francisco. Earth's temperature has risen to two degrees Celsius, and not the 1.2 Celsius now as they claim. It's not just the CO2, but other factors like methane gas have raised Earth's temperature to actual two degrees Celsius, where human extinction is inevitable. Even worse, Earth's temperature is heading towards 3.5 Celsius, where no human life can exist on Earth. - Is there anything we can do to fix it? - No. Industrial civilization has heated planet Earth to cause human extinction. - [Kim] Are you sure there's nothing we can do? - Yes, we have to accept our fate, it is death. At least we still have love, and I see that you are lovely couples. So spend a lot of time with each other, make love, have a lot of sex, be nice to everyone, because at the end, love is all we have left before we go extinct.
