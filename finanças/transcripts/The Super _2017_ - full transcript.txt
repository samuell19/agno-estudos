Getting better. - I dropped off rent this morning. - Yeah. I stopped by to see if you'll be home tomorrow so we can change out your locks. - Why? - A master key ring went missing. Well, can you change them now? No, no. No. We've gotta change the locks out on the whole floor. - Oh. - Yeah. Nothing for you to worry about. We'll surely keep an eye on you. Yeah, I was wondering too if, uh, you'd given any thought to my proposal. Yes. Yeah, I did. Um, thank you very much, but I cannot switch apartments right now. Be less expensive for you. Yeah, I know. I appreciate it a lot. If anything changes, I'll let you know. - Okay. - Okay. Bye, Mr. Johnson. - Thank you, thank you. - Okay. Ann, I'm home. Ann? Hey, Brad. Brad? Hey. There he is. Hi. How was your day'? Mine was okay. I think one of my students was sick. Threw up on my shoes, that was super fun. - No. - No? - It's your favorite. - Uh-uh. All right. I'm gonna leave this right here. Mm. Maybe a little later. I have a mountain of papers to grade. ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ ♪ Wake unto me ♪ See you later then. ♪ Starlight and dewdrops ♪ ♪ Waiting for thee ♪ ♪ Sounds of the rude world ♪ ♪ Heard in the day ♪ ♪ Lulled by the moonlight ♪ ♪ Have all passed away ♪ ♪ Oh, beautiful dreamer ♪ Brad? What's wrong? Sweetie? Wait, let me turn the music back on. What the hell happened to this thing? Here. There we go. See? It's all right. Ow! Mm. Brad? Brad, what's going on? Hey. Brad, where did you get these? Brad, where did you get these? - Brad, give me the keys. Brad, give them to me, please. Please, don't-- - Ah. - Get out! - Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Hello? Hello? I'm calling the police. No! No, please! No! No! No! No. No! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! No! No! Hi. Uh, Phil Lodge here to see Mr. Johnson. - I see you were here last week. - Yes, sir. - Yeah, right over there. - Thank you. - Daddy? - Yeah. - Why can't I come in? - I'm just gonna be a second. So you stay down here with your sister, okay? Hey, Violet, I want you to keep an eye on Rose for me, okay? Right this way. Mr. Johnson, this is Mr. Lodge. - Coffee? - No, thank you. - All right. So, Sylvi didn't tell me. How'd you hear about the position? Uh, one of my daughters. Her old teacher lives here. She told me about an apartment. I came to look at the place, Sylvi told me there might be a job available. Six years with the Newburgh Police. And Why'd you leave? Uh, my wife passed away. Oh, sorry. Loved being a cop, but, uh... couldn't risk having my daughters grow up without both of their parents, so here we are. Let's take a look. Ah, Bernard Shaw. Nice to see someone your age enjoying the classics. The building was originally the headquarters for Pete Moore Savings and Loan until it went under in the Depression. Depression put them under in '33. There's more than one sub-basement that made up the old vault area. Place is a maze. I don't even go down there. It's off-limits to tenants, of course. Owners and high-end renters have access to the gym the conference room, the lounges. Get a good deal. Well, we like to keep our more affluent residents happy. You know, they pay very expensive maintenance fees. Some pay for parking in our garage. It's more than-- more than some of the tenants' rent. This way, now. Hey. Give me one of those. Thanks. Who are you? I'm Rose. You don't belong here, Rose. Well, not that it's part of your job, but it'd be good to have someone on staff with your experience. - Are there problems? - No, no. Heavens, no. With the low-income tenants, it's always good to have an extra pair of eyes. I'm not familiar with furnaces. - I'm pretty handy. - You know what? That's good. That's one of the oldest working furnaces in all of New York City right there. That's-- Look at that. Pennsylvania Boiler Works, 1890. Yeah, don't mind those photos over there. Those belong to Walter. Now, Walter's our most senior super. Yeah, best to keep an eye on him. He's into some Ukrainian psycho voodoo shit, but... probably nothing to get excited about. Well, this is-- There you go. Usual staff quarters are all taken. But, uh, well, this should do for now. Have to call Conrad about that. It's not much, I know. No, it's, uh-- Uh, as long as it's only temporary. Thank you for this. Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m. Bright and early. - 7:00, it is. - Don't be late. How many times do I have to tell you? I'll get these myself. I don't want you in my apartment alone. I understand. Excuse me. Uh, my daughters, one 14, one seven, have you seen them? Do you mind? Excuse me, I didn't see a seven-year-old, but I saw a teenage girl a few minutes ago by that door. I appreciate it. Thank you. I doubt I'll still even be here when school starts, so... I don't even wanna think about where I'm gonna go. I told you to watch your sister. Bye. Bye. - Give me the rest of the cigarettes. - He only gave me one. He only gave you one? Daddy? Hey, there you are, baby. I was looking for you. Where do I get a ball like that, Daddy? - Ball like what? - The one the boy had. Everything all right? It's great. - I'm Beverly. - That's Violet. She's my oldest. Thank you very much, by the way. - Are you taking a place here? - Actually, I got a job here as the super. So, next time you see me, I'll be in uniform. - Phil Lodge. - Well, welcome aboard, Phil. Thank you very much. Can we leave now? - Why? - I don't like it here. If Mommy were here, she'd want to leave too. You're gonna like it here. - Stop that. Who's in here? Don't think I won't use this. Damn it, Murphy. Boy, leave it alone. That's not for you. You all right, baby? What's wrong, baby? I'm sorry. I thought the room was empty. Clearly it's not. I'm Phil Lodge. Hi. I just started working here. I live here, so-- Suppose they should've told you. Did you need anything else? Hey. What do you think you're doing, man? No, I'm just fucking around, dude. You can take that. You can take anything you want. 38-C moved out. She left all that. I'm Julio. Phil Lodge. Hey, Phil, good to meet you. Does this happen a lot? It's a lot of stuff. Well, you know, some people donate stuff and some people, they just leave it. I took a dresser. So, is this your first gig as a super? Yeah, I used to be a cop, actually. Well, this is gonna be a lot less exciting. I don't mind that. Get to spend a lot more time with my kids anyway. Vondell. Vondell! Vondell, stop with the ball. Stop with the ball. You're scuffing up the wall. How many times do I gotta tell you this? Fucking kid. Anyways, family is the most important thing. - Ah, it's pretty empty, huh? - Yeah, don't worry about that. Come Monday morning, it's gonna be like Macy's out there. What's your name? - That's Violet. - Hey, Violet. I'm Julio. Right, she's just quiet. See you later, sweetie. Rose? Rose? Rose? Rose! Rose! Rose? Hey! Hey. What are you doing, baby? Just looking at the flames. Just come upstairs with me. Please. How's the little one? Rose seemed lost. How do you know my daughter's name, Walter? She told me. You spoke to my daughter? Just enough, Phil. Just head up to 70-B, will ya? There's a faulty window. It's off the track up there. It's gonna break somebody's neck. We'll have a damn claim on our hand. Cal, listen up. I'm getting complaints about Mrs. Grey's dog yapping. She knows she can't leave that animal alone up in there. Go check it out. Yeah, but she said she'll have you fire me if I'm up there when she's not home. She lived in this building 50 years, payin' $100 rent. I don't give a rat's ass what Mrs. Grey wants. - Go check it out. - Yes, sir. Cal. I can go up with you if you like. Hello? Mrs. Grey? Mrs. Grey? - Did she say she was going away? - If she did, I tuned her out. Come here, boy. Get over here. Come here. Mrs. Grey? All right, put it down and let's get out here. Oh, but-- We can't leave him. We should take the dog, right? This is your idea, not mine. All right. - What the hell? - Daddy said I can have the dog. What's that thing? I think someone's little princess outgrew it. It's just perfect for mine. Okay, there you go, sweetie. - I wish Mommy could see it. - And I'm still on the floor? It's just for now. I'm still on the floor too. - I'm so fucking sick of this. - Hey, language. Everything's for Rose! Every goddamn thing we do! Violet, wait. Mom, door. Little busy over here, Vondell. Get your ass up and get it. Come on. Violet, right? Yeah. You know, I have a younger sister. She was always getting in the way, messing up my life. There are so many times I really thought I was gonna kill her. You know? What are you doing here? That was weird. Julio. Hey, you got a flat-head screwdriver? Must've left it inside. Beverly. - You're so athletic. My wife works for Beverly at the Folk Art Museum. - Hi. - Hi. Sofia reach you? Friday, 8:00 p.m. at the terrace. - Turning fuckin' 50, bro. My wife's throwing me a birthday party to depress me. You're coming, by the way. He said someone was at the door. - Freddy, what happened? - Vondell Evans is missing. I mean, he pulls this crap all the time, but usually it's just for an hour or two. Someone has my son! Von! Julio, what do you know about Walter? He's got those pictures by the furnace that freak me out every time I see them. I'm gonna see you later. If you ask me, the place is haunted. Something down, it's gone. Look again, it's back. - Hello. Violet? Violet? What's going on? The police are looking for, uh, Vondell, the kid you were smoking with, uh... They don't know what happened. He probably just ran away. I just got a little worried. We have to look out for each other, right? Violet, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Don't worry, Rose. Your father is still there. What's that? Now, this, this is Nisitas. He was tormented. So tormented, he moved to a cave and lived as a hermit. But then Nisitas learned to do something. Something so magic that no one has ever done before. - What? - He whispers. Can you hear him? You, you know what happened to this boy, Vondell. He is missing. Show me where he is. Show me. Show me where he is! Hey. Hey! What are you doing? I don't want you around my children. Never again. Bye-bye, Rose. Baby, come on. Bye-bye. Violet? Sweetie. Sweetie. Daddy? I just saw Mommy. Mommy and I were in the garden, and she let me use the hose, and everything that I watered turned into flowers. They were everywhere. Go back to bed, baby. - What are you doing, Lodge? - I'm just mopping, sir. Just do the halls. You don't need to go in there. It's not part of your job. Yes, sir. I apologize. All right. Violet. Give it a chance, okay? You might have a good time. What do you think? With or with no chocolate frosting? - There's the man. - Hey. - I'm Sofia, Julio's wife. - Phil. Nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. - Happy birthday, sir. - Oh, thanks, man. - Oh, all right. - Thank you so much. - My kids. - Hector and Diego. - Hey, Hector. Julio said you have two. Violet right here, this is my oldest. Little sister Rose is... run off to find some fun somewhere, I guess. Hey, you want something to eat? Uh, yeah. Violet, you hungry? Who is that? So, Violet, what do you think of Beverly? I wanted to stay at the party. Mommy would've let me stay. - Violet? - What do you care? Why did we have to leave? Other people got to stay. I know. - Daddy? - Yeah. - Smells bad. - What does, sweetie? Rose. Rose. - What's going on? - What's wrong? I don't like it, Daddy. It's all wet. Dad. I'll be right back. Hey. Did they find Vondell? Johnson doesn't like things on the walls. I know you were in my apartment, Walter. I'm gonna have to kill you, all right? Uh... Uh... Phil. Hey, Phil. What's going on, guys? Hey, are you okay? Wouldn't worry too much about Walter. He told me that after his wife died every night at dinnertime he'd see her sitting across the table from him. I thought it was kind of romantic. Yeah. You have a strange sense of romance. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, after my college boyfriend proposed to me, - I couldn't stop laughing. - You laughed at him? Then he called me a mental patient, and that was that. Don't worry, it's not like I'm gonna... come after you with a knife or anything. Hey, um, I should get going. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Well... um... just... put your dead bolt on. Okay. Phil? Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the color of these walls though. I love this building. It has such a good vibe. Well, the building was originally the headquarters of Pete Moore Savings and Loan till it went under in the Depression in 1933. Look at this. That's her. - That's the teacher. - I know her. That's Violet's favorite teacher. She was the one that told me how much she loved this place. - Why would she move out? - Family emergency. People split all the time. That's blood, man. Mr. Johnson? Can I show you something? Look at this. That's blood. You do some maintenance too, huh? So you like it? - Yeah, we'll take it. - Well, that's good. We have three terraces, a roof garden, and a gym, conference room, lounge. I have something I think I should show you. Hello? Excuse me. The elevator's stuck. It makes perfect sense that it's Johnson. We don't know that yet. But he was acting weird around this room. You get the old rent-control tenants out, prices skyrocket. There's nothing in here, bro. What? I don't know if he's a murderer, but... he's definitely a pervert. Hello. The elevator isn't moving. Excuse me. Hello! Hello? Shit! Aah! Shit. You're so stubborn. You would not listen. You are gonna re-- Get away from me! Get away! No! No! Get off! No! Hey, what's wrong? Hey, what's wrong? - This is your fault! - What's my fault? This would've never happened if Mom was here! Maybe I wouldn't have creepy, fucking old men chasing me around basements. What's going on? - I'm taking this guy down right now! What are you doin', man? What are you doin'? Dude, she needs that to get around. Exactly. She's not away. Something happened to her. The same thing that happened to Vondell. The same thing that's gonna happen to my kids unless I do something about this. What if it was your kids he was threatening? Dude, planting evidence? Make an anonymous call. They'll talk to him, they'll get a warrant. I promise you, they'll find plenty of real evidence on their own. He's coming, he's coming, he's coming. Hey, Walter. Sofia's looking for you. There's a leak in 12-B. So fix it. It's no secret they think I'm a shitty plumber. Johnson's office is right below. Please. We don't want that stuff leaking through. - I don't have my tools-- - Can you just get 'em, Walter? And do me a solid, please? No. I owe you, Walter. Don't fuckin' do that! Now fuckin' what? We make an anonymous call. When was the last time you saw the tenant in 15-H, Mrs. Grey? Oh, I got hundreds of tenants, you know. She could be in the park, or she's shopping, she's riding a bike. Who knows? Listen. Do me a favor. If you hear something, give me a call. When I was 12, my mother had an affair. And... my dad had all these connections, so he managed to get custody and basically... cut her out of our lives. Sorry to hear that. I was a little younger than Violet, so I know what it's like to act out at her age. Ah, Violet. I'm the bad guy right now. She blames me for everything. Which I don't really fault her for, 'cause... I blame myself. For what? There was a fire. And my wife was stuck upstairs. The floor collapsed. I was able to get Rose and myself out. But I wasn't able to reach her. What about Violet? Uh, she was in the yard. Thank God for that. So Violet, when her mom died... she wanted everything else dead too. I'm sorry. You're a good dad. Hey. Why did they let him go? He didn't know how the old lady's cane handle ended up in the dresser. They're not even convinced the old lady is missing. They also didn't find anything else when they searched his place, Phil. You can't protect them. I'm coming for them. - Dad? You all right? Yeah. What are you doing up? I heard you and thought you were having a bad dream or something. Come here. You are a good kid. Are you okay, bro? Yeah. Haven't been getting much sleep. I guess with Walter back, I'm just kind of freaking out. Hey, you seen Phil and Julio? Hello? Walter? Are you guys looking at the work screen or what? I've been texting you all morning. 38-C has a problem with the lock. - I got it. I got it. - Phil's taking it. You want the job, don't you, Phil? - You keep an eye on her. - Yeah, yeah. - Maybe I should go help him with the lock. - You're not going anywhere. - Oh. I'm watchin' the kids. - Hello? - Hey. Uh, the office said that you had a problem with one of your locks. Yeah, I woke up, and they were all unlocked. - The dead bolts and everything. - Oh, my gosh. Can you please just put some clothes on? I'm sorry to drag you up here. She just stumbled in really late last night. I did not stumble. I never stumble. I don't know what you're talking about. Julio? Julio? Violet? Are you all right? - Where's Julio? - He left. Where's Rose, Violet? - Where's Rose? - You know where she is. Something reeks. Smells just like Rose's bed. Hey, listen, you go back, and you lock the door. - Okay? Okay? - Fine. You're fine, baby. Hey, sweetie. Come here. Puppy, don't go. Puppy. Hello, Phil. The knowledge has been passed down for generations. Nisitas was the first. With a great fire, he summoned the unwanted souls. He forged a chain and sent back the cursed ones from where they came. Where is she, Walter? He protected us from the dead. Now it is me who must protect us. Where is she? Where is she? - Where is she? - Where is she? Dad? Where is she? Where? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Please tell me where she is. Give her back to me! - Coming. Violet. Can I come in? Yeah. Daddy? Rose. I was really worried about you. Where were you, baby? I heard the bad person. So I ran away. He was chasing me. I'm glad you're okay. Hey, I was just about to call you. Julio-- Listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. Hey, man, what's wrong? What's wrong with you? Mr. Johnson. You're not gonna like this. Let me call you back. I thought he had my baby, and I-- I just wanted him to tell me where she was. I just couldn't stop. Okay. Where is he? He was right here. Yeah? You lost him? Phil, look at me. Phil. What's going on with you, man? Why was this in your apartment? That's mine. Who are you? I'm Rose. I don't think I've ever met you before, Rose. Most people don't see me until it's their time. He was my friend. He found out. They'd take you away from us. That's my sister. She's the cute one. - You know, I think it helps-- - Don't try to be my mom. I'm not your mom, Violet. I want to show you something. This is Rose. Mr. Lodge? Mr. Lodge? Walter was right about you, Mr. Lodge. When I rehired him, he suggested you falsified your resume. Newburgh Police has no record-- no record of you. There must be some mistake. Oh, no. No! No! No! She's cute. You know, I've never actually met her. That was just before the funeral. - And that's Rose? - No, that's me. You looked a lot like her. That was taken seven years ago. - Daddy. - No. - Violet, I don't understand. - This is where we grew up. Burned down on our birthday. You and Rose have the same birthday? Of course we do. We're twins. I'm three minutes older. You and Rose can't be twins. Phil said she's only seven. No, we were both seven. We were both seven the day she died. She can't be dead. Phil talks about her. He sees her. He sees her, and that weird janitor Walter sees her ever since we moved here, and... You'll see her too. No! No. Oh, God! Please. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Please. Oh, no. No! Daddy. Violet's telling. Rose always did whatever she wanted, and no one ever did anything about it. My favorite teacher, Ms. Daigle. Did you know her? She used to live here until Rose got to her. We were friends. That's all it took. I had a picture of Vondell. I never got one of Mrs. Grey. I think Rose just wanted her dog. It's been happening like this ever since she died. I don't think she can be stopped. I don't understand what-- Don't you get it? She's evil. Hey, Phil. Have you seen Julio'? His phone is off, and I can't seem to find him. You're not covering for my husband, are you, Phil? I mean, I know the kind of man... Phil? Yeah, he's up on the-- On the roof fixing a railing. Give him that when you see him. Rose set the fire that burned the house down? It was all because Mom wanted to punish Rose. For all she's done. Rose burned down the house. I didn't know my mother was home. I swear I didn't. Violet told Daddy what I did. So he broke my neck and threw me out of a window. How did you get in here? You see her, don't you? - Daddy knows what Violet said. - We have to get out of here. Why are we doing this? If you saw Rose, it means my dad's not far behind. I don't understand. Shit! - Hello, Beverly. - Rose? - Beverly. I'm sorry. Phil? I'm sorry. Run! No! No! - Wait. - Let's go this way! There's no way out. Daddy! Rose. - What are you-- - No! You can't touch her! - Violet. - You-- - What are you doing? Get off of her! You do not touch her. You can't. He's getting rid of her. Daddy! - She's just a child. What-- - No, she's not! Violet, help me! Daddy! Daddy, Daddy, help me. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. Phil. Phil. I'm trying to save you, Phil. No. Phil, you don't have to do this. Please. Daddy, wait. You know what I really want? A mommy. - What do I do? - Just do what she says, and it's okay. Are we done, baby? No, Daddy. We're just getting started.
