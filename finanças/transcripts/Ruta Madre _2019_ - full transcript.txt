I wondered how I reached this point. How my dreams kept me from living. As in most stories, it all started a while ago. It all started when she leaped into my life. Hi. Yes, you. Hey. I'm Daisy. What's your name? Daniel. Hi Daniel. Well, looks like we are neighbors. This is you, and this is me... ...and we can live together in the castle. What do you mean we? Look, if we are going to be living here together in the castle, you better watch out for dragons, I mean... They breath fire, you know! I'm gonna get you for that! Can fate and chance make worlds collide while holding hands to walk the tides? I hide behind my see through walls and hope his spirit hears my calls. Trapped in my youth of here and now to find his love... I don't know how. I've always wondered, why don't you ever talk about your mom and dad? I mean, I know you live with your grandma, but do you ever get to see them? To be honest... I don't even remember what my mom and dad looked like. No one gives me a straight answer. It's like a freaking mystery. From what I gather, my dad's some Mexican guy that bailed on my mom when she was pregnant with me. Yeah? We have something in common. Oh yeah, what's that? I never really knew my dad either. He bailed on my mom and me. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be. Like my mom always says."It's an old story in a big city". Wait! Aren't you forgetting something? Here. It's your very own book of shadows. You can fill it with your dreams and poetry... ...even lyrics for that silly little rock band you're starting. It's not a silly rock band! We're gonna unleash the horns of rock on the world! And thanks. Gonna make me break this door down? Shit! There goes my American Stress. Let's go Mexican. Much better. What the hell, man? Dude, I don't speak Spanish, remember? Gosh! What are you even doing here in the first place? What do you mean you don't speak Spanish? What kind of a Mexican are you? ' No espeaky Spanish '. Speak English! Get up. Get in the shower. I'm taking your ass back to Mexico! Who do you think you are? I don't see you in years and you just come barging in here telling me you're taking me to Mexico? Says who? On whose authority? On the authority of the one who pays your bills. Is that enough for you? Grandma? What did I do? You didn't say anything, now, did you? No. Not yet. But I will... ...unless you get your nalgas in the shower right now! Okay! This is your car? Yeap! Can I drive it? No. That's never gonna happen. Hasta crees, güey. Hey! What's up, buddy? Grandma, do you have the rolled tacos with the guacamole? No. Eat your lengua. What's lengua? Tongue. Great! My first french kiss in Mexico is with a damned cow. Are you taking care of my house? ...clean as a whistle. We are going to the hairdresser. You're getting a haircut? No, you are getting a haircut! What? I can't cut my hair! This is my source of rock n' roll power! It's my lion's mane! Remember what happened to Sampson? On a bad hair day. You are getting a haircut... ¡y punto! You better eat it all up. You're gonna need your strength. I'm running some errands in TJ later... I don't need a psychologist! And eat your lengua. I can understand what you guys are saying. I can understand perfectly. I just cant speak it. So, what are you guys talking about? Personally I think he looked better as a girl. This is the way to the doctor's? Are you sure it's safe? Sure it's safe, unless you look like a tourist. What kind of doctor is this? She's no doctor. You don't speak Spanish do you? Inside. It's me! I know it's you! Sit down. Take off your shirt. Excuse me? Take off your shirt, now! You better do it or she might turn you into a... I'm serious. Just as I suspected. What is this? Stay there. Probably you are gonna need one too. Maybe I should have one too just in case... Shhh! Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it. I feel a strong presence. Daniel. You gave your heart to someone who didn't accept it. And now it can't survive on its own. There is hope, but you have to leave now. Rodrigo! What just happened? Your grandfather just showed us the way. If you want to live, both of you have to leave now and find the cure. I gotta go home and back, and... I don't have any clothes... There's no time to spare! I don't know how long it will be before the darkness takes over your heart. Borrow some of Rodrigo's clothes. Yeah. You can borrow some of my clothes, and then I'll take you to the bus terminal. No. I've seen Mexican buses in movies and they're full of chickens and pigs. Is there at least like a Greyhound or something? You're going with him! Eyyy! Both of you have to leave now! Now! Wait! There's a long way between here and where you need to go. Let the arrows guide the way. You must pay attention to the signs. Everything is an omen. Every person, a guide, a misguide,... ...an angel o demonio. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Hey! This is a clean machine. And this is her Chardonnay. You always have to make sure she's perfectly lubed. You know what? You actually look pretty good. Well, I feel like a drug dealer. Rodrigo! What is she doing here? ¡Ayy, cabrón! Get in the car! Open the door! You can run, cabrón! But you can't hide! What happened back there with Tía Mirna? Forget it. You know she's gonna strip me bare while I'm away in this pinche trip with you. So, we might as well enjoy it. So there's no problem with drinking and driving here? That depends. On what? On whether you get caught or not. So yo better pace yourself, cabrón. Well, when in Rome... Huh? Did you fart? No! Why does it smell like something's burning? It's just your car. No! - Well, pull over! Pull over! - What? The car is on fire! Pull over! Alright! What are you doing? ¡Ayy, güey! What the hell? I told Pepe to check everything! Someone is getting so fired. You know what I think? I think this is a bad omen. How is this a bad omen? It's some idiot forgetting to put the cap back on the oil. How is that a bad omen? Weren't you the last one who checked the oil? You know what? Why don't you just go and check out the kick ass view? ♪ It's the lonely road I'm traveling ♪ I'm past a broken man. ♪ Heading for destruction with a curse upon my head. ♪ Faith has got me now and it's time for me to fly. ♪ Faith has got me now and no time to say goodbye. ♪ Daisy, you'll see. ♪ Daisy, you'll see. ♪ It doesn't matter the road I'm running... ♪ ...or the way the wind is blowing,... ♪ ...it all comes back to you. So there I was, at the crossroads... ...with a broken car, a crazy uncle... ...and her name in every song I heard. Standing on the edge, with only one way to go... Hey! So, what's in the bag? Did you bring lunch? Funny you should ask. Let's walk. So, how did you like our demo? I loved your demo. But what I really loved is the lyrics. They're so poetic. It's because they are for you. For me? I'm serious. Everything I do is because of you. But it wasn't till right now that I was man enough to tell you. No! What's the matter? Daniel, I can't be with you. I can't have you sacrifice your life for the sake of saving mine. Do you even love this other guy? It just happened. So, then I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you and the baby. We'll get married and we'll start our own lives together. I have to go. I'm sorry. Hey! What are you doing? Didn't you read then sign? Your uncle is looking for you. Thanks. ¡Cabroncito! Step away from the ledge. What are you doing? Who's that girl? What girl? The girl you sent to come get me. I'm worried you might be getting sun stroke. Lucky for you we have the perfect remedy for that in the car. That is amazing! I told you! Newsweek says it's one of the best places to eat in the whole world. That was awesome! Give me some dollars. Why? Because I got the food, you get the music. I don't have any money! Run! The car is that way! You guys are great! Really good! You know I'm really glad we got to do this... ...you and me, partiendo la Baja. Me too, uncle. You keep your eyes on the road because the fog, see, it could be bad. We'll just stop and pull over. No, no, you don;t want to do that. Why not? Because there could be bandidos on this road. So, then we won't stop. Exactly. If you see someone on this road trying to make you stop, you don't! As a matter of fact, you aim well and step on it all the way. You mean, run them over? Yeah! But what if they have like a gun or something? Then you step on it and duck! Hey uncle, can you tell me about my grandpa? I don't remember much. He loved music-that's where you got your passion from. He used to bring out his guitar and he'd make me and your mom sing to him. You know, she had the most beautiful voice. Try and keep the car steady, alright? What are you doing? I need to pee. Alright. So, we'll pull over... No, I can do it in the bottle just try... No! You are not doing it in the bottle! Oh, gosh! Hey uncle... Hmmm. What did you say about bandidos I don't know. I don't remember. Why? Cuz these guys want us to stop. No! Stop the car! Are these bandidos? No, they are worse! They are bandidos with a license! Hurry up! Listen to me. Whatever happens you let me do the talking, okay? Hola! No. No. My cookies! Don't push it! Okay? We are lucky they didn't take our calzones. Just get in the car! Tell me again about this girl. Who? Daisy? Is that her name? Yeah. So, yeah. Tell me about Daisy. We kind of grew up together and she lived next door to me. We always had this amazing connection. You wouldn't believe her poetry. I mean, she is the best writer I ever read. Is she hot? What? You know... Are you...? Oh, come on! Really? What? She's a gringa, yeah? Yeah. You better watch out for those American girls. They'll rip your heart and throw it in the trash like a piece of rotten meat. Why? Did you ever have to deal with a heartbreak? Oh yeah! But let me tell you something. The difference between American women and Latin women... ...American women, they'll rip out your heart,... ...but Latin women...they'll rip out your huevos! Comprende? The fog is getting really thick and I'm getting pretty tired...we must have passed the hotel. I already told you, we haven't passed it. Just keep driving! If you want to drive, be my guest, cause I need a bed now! Well, that's why we have to find the hotel. You said you knew where it was! Well, this fog is confusing me, alright? Just pull over and we'll wait for it to clear! Are you ready to go eat? We should probably head out... the fog is probably... You've got to be kidding me! I'm such an idiot! What am I doing here? Buenos días. Sleep well? I slept in the car. Oh, I slept in the hotel. Why didn't you wake me up? Because you were sleeping like a baby. I didn't want to wake you up. Help me put these in the car... No, I have to make a phone call! ¿Cómo se dice...? ...collect call...Estados Unidos... The United States. I need to make a phone call to the United States. Hey, uncle... You know I've never seen a picture of my mom. Did you guys look alike? No. No, she was beautiful. I inherited the more macho rugged looks of my father. You never finished telling me how he died. One day we went swimming. He dove into the water... ...he didn't know a week before they dumped cement pylons into the ocean. He broke his neck. He died instantly. Can you imagine being 12 years old and having to drag your father's body out of the water? We got him to the bed of his truck... ...drove him to the ranch... ...haven't moved it ever since. I'm sorry, uncle. I'm having a déjà vu. This guy isn't going to screw us over, is he? Not if you don't give me no reason. You speak English? I'm from Huntington Beach. What are you doing out here? Look, let's just say that the less you know, the better. There's something we have to worry about, isn't there? I'm messing with you! Really? Okay. I swallowed some condoms full of drugs... ...that I have to crap out, but that's not till we get there. What? Are you kidding me? You know, you guys are okay. The minute I get there, you're off the hook. You're not serious, are you? Nah, messing with you! I think you were telling the truth. I mean, why would the Federales just let us go? Drunk driving is the least of their worries. Of course, if you really, really want to know... ...you can always cut me open and find out, if you dare. Come on, gentlemen. This here is for our protection and the protection of our merchandise. You know? I think what we need is a little music to lighten the moment. So, turn the radio on. Come on, keep trying! There's always something. Hey look, look! ♪ Ya estás aquí. No hay vuelta atrás. ♪ No importa el mañana. Estamos en Tijuana. Is that the only song they play in Mexico? You're uptight. You are gonna love Santa Rosalía. You'll thank me for it. Why do I have the feeling we are totally and utterly screwed? You know? They got a cathedral there that was designed by Gustav Eiffel. The same guy that designed the Eiffel Tower? Very same one. We should go check that out. Everything there is French. Including the french horse. Why do we care about french horses? Not horses! French horse! He means horse. Like the ones that run down the racetrack... Horse! Putas, prostitutas... Ohh. Whores! What are they doing all the way out here? I mean, isn't Paris the place to be for that? There used to be a french mining company there and when they left, they left everything french. Including the french horse. Whores! It sounds the same to me. Somehow I don't think you want to mistake the one for the other. I guess not. You will love it there! You know, the mixture of the races...the French and the Mexican... Man, I'm getting excited. I think I'm popping wood... All right! Save it for when we get there! You know Sobrino, this could actually be good for you. Forget about that heartbreak of yours. I'm fine, Uncle. Don't worry about it. You are not a virgin, are you? He's no virgin, you know, he is my nephew! Hey, maybe we can get a discount for deflowering him! I'm not a virgin! I'm not a virgin! Okay, okay, relax, relax. We're just gonna go there, talk to them, have a couple of drinks. It'll be perfectly innocent. Come on! Aren't you even a little bit curious, french whores in Mexico, Señor? The best way to forget about women is with more women. Listen to your uncle. So it's settled then. We'll go there.

I'm a Chicano. Where are my friends? The two older guys that were peeing on the street? Must be them. Police took them. Are you okay? Maybe I can give you some advice. Right now, I'm having a hard time believing in God. Why give me the talents and take away my inspirations? A wise man built his house on a rock. The rains came and it never fell. A foolish man built his house on the sand. The rains came, and beat on that house, and great was it's fall. I'm not sure how that applies to me. Where did you build your house? What do you mean? If you have the foundation, you can weather any storm that life will bring you. I don't care about foundations, alright? I just care about Daisy, and I need to get back to her. Where is the jail? Baby. ¡No! Hi. Ah, hola. ...peeing in front of the cathedral? - Huh? - They left! Oh my gosh! Where did they go? I'm a police officer, not a tour guide. Hey, excuse me. Please tell me you speak English. - English? - Yes. Me? Do I speak English? - Yes! - No! Nah, I'm just kidding. I speak English. Do you know a place where they have french whores? French... horse? Yeah, french whores. You want a french horse? Does it have to be french? No! French prostitutes! Mujeres! Women! Ohh, putas! Yeah! You go... over there... there's a house... ...that has the french whores. All kinds of whores. They got them all over there. Five... five... kilometers! Five kilometers? Five kilometers. That's just till you get out of town. Then, once you are over there, you're gonna go another three or four miles... ...and then there's like a bridge and a palm tree. Once you're ther.. you're gonna keep going... ...and then you're gonna go another three or four miles and it's over that way... and you'll get there. Three or four miles. Is there a trolley or a bus? No, there's no trolley or bus... ...hey, you know what? I gotta horse I can rent to you. It will take you there. Twenty dollars... one way... it'll take you. One way? How am I gonna get him back? The horse knows it's way back. He lives over here! I thought you said he was a horse! He's a horse! He's a horse! Well... he is mostly horse. Eighty percent he is a horse. His mom... maybe not so much horse... He's a donkey! Okay... technically, maybe yes, but... half. His mom was a donkey, but we don't talk about her too much. His dad, now... todo horse! If you look down there, you'll see he was a thoroughbred. Okay, all you gotta do... is you gotta hold on to these things... and then you go, 'gitty up'...not yet though... and I'll buckle you in. You gotta hold on for the ride of your life because he can get up to a full 5 mph if you push him really hard. Now, I'm also gonna give you this...because it can get a little rough down there. You hold on to this, and if you get into any trouble, start swinging that thing. Not at me! Wait till you get out of here first. Okay, hold on. You ready? So... what do I say? You gonna... you tell him the password, and he knows the way. You go like this... hey! Cuchi, cuchi, cola. You know the way. Cuchi, cuchi... Arre! Let's go! Cuchi what? Cuchi what? Thank you. I'm... I'm looking for two men. Ahh! I see. Well, we only have girls here. No, no... I don't mean... I love women. It's okay! No judging here! No, no. It's not that. I'm looking for my uncle and some guy. Hey! There he is! Come over here! Ahh! Ménage à trois. If there's one thing a man can always find is the... Hey, sobrino. Come here. You gotta try some of this elixir. Hey, I don't know. Be careful, that's for men. Hey Cherrie! These are my friends. Anything they want, is on me. Except this one... she'll be on me later. You two are just in time for the show. The show? What show? The show. The show? I don't know... Jolie femmes! Come down! Do you speak English? Some. Is this your first time? Look, you don't have to do this. I don't want you to do this! Hey Flaco! ¡No! ¡No! I don't understand. What are you doing here? Does your family know you're here? I'm here for my little sisters and brothers. They need a roof over their heads. This is the only way. I can take you out of here. I like it! I like it! I like it! I like it! What did they say? ¡It's a raid! We gotta get out of here! No, wait! I gotta find my uncle. Go, go! You get out of here! Sorry! - Sobrino, is that you? - Yeah, it's me! Oh, I've never been so happy to see you! Cut me loose! Cut me loose! Cuchi cola? What? Nothing! Where are my clothes? Here, take this! Wait! What about Flaco? What about Flaco? Well, we can't just leave him here! Sure we can! Just watch! No, no! I'm gonna find him! Where are my pants? I don't know! Just, come on! Should have stayed in jail! - The coast is clear. - Let's go. Conchita. ¡Mi Conchita! ¡Mi Conchita! ¡No! Your taillight is busted! Okay, okay. Where exactly did you say he was? I don't know. Let's just go find him. Stay quiet! No! Is he dead? Yeah, he looks pretty dead to me. Let's go! No! He's breathing. Come on, help me! Just pull his pants up. I'm not gonna pull his pants up! You've got to pull his pants up. Come on, hurry! You've got to zip him up too! You zip him up! I'm not zipping him up! You crazy? Let's just go! This guy is heavy for a Flaco. Maybe he didn't poop the drugs out yet. The car's that way. Put him down! Get the keys. If your grandmother asks, that did not happen! Wait, wait, listen! It's our song! Oh, yeah! ♪ ¡Véngase pa ca! ¡Muévase mamá! ♪ ¡Véngase pa ca! ¡Muévase mamá! You know, I always felt that same pain. You're that girl. Who are you? You can see I'm your guardian angel. I'm scared. I'm afraid I can't live without her. Well, this is why you're here. Just stay the course. Follow the arrows and you'll find the roots. But, is this root really gonna cure me? I mean, what am I supposed to do? Make it a tea? Eat it? Smoke it? Or... ¡No! Hey look! He's alive! We saved your nalgas from the Narcotráfico and the Federales, cabrón. Well, you were supposed to leave me there. Oh, you see! I told you! We weren't gonna leave you there! You would have been killed by the drug dealers or arrested by the Federales. Either way, we saved your nalgas! No, mijo. I'm DEA. Congratulations, gentlemen. You've just participated in your firs bi-national drug sting. You two guys are heroes. Wait! What? You're a pinche gringo police! I told you I was from Huntington Beach! So, I guess you didn't swallow a condom full of drugs? Hey, I don't swallow... ...and I wasn't gonna let you blow my cover. So, where are we? I don't know. We are somewhere close to Constitución. Really? Consitución... you know, there's this little Mexican restaurant... ...if you go straight, and then as you turn south, it should be right there. You guys hungry? I'll treat. You know, on me. Hey! I was gonna buy you breakfast! Was that close to the restaurant? Not far enough. Hey, we are getting pretty close to the ranch. Excited? About what? What do you mean about what? This is the end of our adventure. Oh really? So, this is where you tell me about all these ridiculous secrets? About how my mom died and why no one has ever showed me a damn picture of her? You know what? You can't even begin to understand... Why don't you try me. I'm all ears! I think I'm hallucinating. What? I think I see Tía Mirna. Mirna! No. Hey, Daniel. I'm sorry to call you so early in the morning. Your phone has been off and no one seems to know where you are. So, about the other day... ...I really need to talk to you. I've been doing a lot of thinking... ...and I just... I really need to tell you something important,... ...but I need to tell you face to face. So, if you could just give me a call back... please. Okay, bye. Rodrigo! Rodrigo! I'm sorry. I gotta get out of here. So, you come all the way down here just to leave? All by yourself? This whole trip was a mistake. First, there's something important that I need to talk to you about. Así que súbete. No, you don't understand. I gotta go, now! Daniel. You're not gonna like what I'm going to say to you, but Daisy,... ...she's just another girl. This is about your family. I don't care about this family! You don't say that. There is nothing more important than family. Who is that girl? There's nobody there. Listen Daniel, I'm real concerned about you because I think you might be having a nervous breakdown about this girl. No. No, I know what I saw. She was just there and I'll prove it. Daniel! Daniel! Ay güey. Walk with me. You know, my father...he told me to always remember... ...that this land was created from the desert. He wanted his grandchildren and his great grandchildren to see what a man could make from nothing. This was the first tree he planted here. That is why we buried him here. He was a giant among men. I thought he was invincible. Now, sometimes I wonder... ...if I hadn't insisted that he'd take me to the beach that day, he would still be alive today. Your mother and I wouldn't have had to drag him out of the ocean. I want you to know that I loved your mother... ...with all my heart. We were twins. The same sole. And here is something you may not know... your father...I knew him well. He was the son of one of the workers. He would come play with us everyday. As we grew up, your mother started looking at him a different way. I mean, she never said it... ...but I knew. I knew that she loved him. Then, one night she came to me crying... ...she was very upset and I couldn't understand what she was saying, but I just thought he had hurt her. So, before she could say anything, I just went out looking for him. Because anyone that hurts my sister, is my enemy... ...even if he is my best friend. Everyone said it was an accident... ...but I killed him. The families thought it was best not to tell her... ...till after you were born, so they just said he ran away. Your grandmother took us to the United States so you could be born there. At first. during the pregnancy... ...things went surprisingly well. She loved you so much, Daniel. After you were born... ...she became very depressed. She couldn't handle it... ...and one day she just walked out into the ocean... ...and she never came back. I'm sorry, Daniel. I can't take all this. I just want to go home. Daniel... I just want to see Daisy. I can't take this anymore either. Why did you bring me here? I'm sorry. I didn't ask for any of this. I'm sorry. I didn't ask to be brought into the world like this. I just want to go back to her. Please, just let me go home. Mom? You know, I don't want to go home. This is my home. And at that moment, I realized that I was an artist. An artist deep rooted with love and pain. Daisy had given me pain, Rodrigo gave me the love I never had... ...and the land gave me the roots that made me who I am. Rodrigo and I stayed down there for quite a while,... There is so much to discover, so much to write about,... ...so many amazing things to see. I had no idea how rich the desert could be. When I came back, I went to see Daisy. I wanted to show her the gift she'd given me and to thank her for loving me to the point of letting me go. As it turns out, she had been calling me to tell me that she decided to give the father of her baby a chance. They got married and... ...they are still together till this day.
