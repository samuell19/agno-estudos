(phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Yeah. Flakes is what? Nigger, you better not be playing. Man, get your ass over here. - Hey, there they go. Right there. (hip hop music) (gun shots) - [Devon] Surprised? I was a football graduate. Top of my class. Bound for stardom. So I thought. Damn, hi baby. - Hi. - How you doing? - I'm doing good. How are you? - I'm all right. Oh, listen. See that guy over there with the coach? - Yeah. - He's from a Big 10 school. He wants to meet with me next week. - You make sure that you don't leave me here all by myself. - Now you know I'm not gonna never leave you. You know why, don't you? - Why? - Because I love you. (giggles) - Come on, I brought you some food. - Oh yeah? - 435. That's the best I've seen in years. I could sign him right now. - You know, Devon, he's a real good kid. He works hard, keeps his grades up. I say we make an appointment. Get him in here to talk to you. Let's get him rolling. - Sounds good. - All right. - It's the newlyweds. - Newlyweds, yes indeed. - What's up, Paco? - Sup homie. - What's up, B-Rod? - What's up, looky lover? - What's up, fellas? - It's happening. Man, I heard there's a party, dog. - Oh, no shit? - At your house? - My house? - Yeah, you ain't know it? Everybody been talking about it, man. Everybody gonna be there. - Fucking Maurice. - You know my cousin's spinning. - Oh, is he? - Yeah, it's going down. It's going down. - Well fuck it. We gotta get our party on. - Better check with your wife, first. - Oh look at you. - Oh, he can party, with me. - What's up, dog? We can't kick it no more? Man, me and you go way back. Since grade school, dog. Man, we even shared the same bath water together. - Oh, so y'all been dirty since way back? (Devon laughs) - Well, fuck it. It's getting hot out here. Let's go. - Come on, let's bounce. - Come on, baby. You go the stuff? - What's up, big brother? - What's up? What's up? What's up, nigger? Sup, bro. - Sup, man. - Look at this. See that, there? That, there, a new car, new house and new clothes. For you, little bro. - You need to get that nigger some damn new socks to cover them busted-ass feet of his. Smell like chopped donkey butt. (laughs) - You know what else I need to get? Your dumb ass some brains. (laughs) - ♪ If I only had a brain ♪ What you need to do is buy this nigger a big ass blunt so he can finish smoking the rest of his life away. - Might get a bowl and shit and where's it at? (laughs) - See? That's all he thinks about. Can't even spell weed. - So, I know how to smoke this shit. (laughing) - Anyway, big bro, where you getting a shoe contract from? - Rodeos. (laughs) - Anyway, hopefully I can get one of them big fat-ass Nike contracts. - For real. - And not give your dumb ass none of it. - All I knows is I'm getting me some Reebok. - What you need to be getting yourself some damn deodorant. Smell like old, spoiled milk. (laughing) - Where the fuck mom at? - She in the kitchen. - All right. - Spoiled milk. I'll whoop your ass. - Get your ass whooped. - Pot head. - I am so proud of you, baby. - Ah baby, we're so proud of you. - Get your fucking hands off me. - Devon, don't talk to him like that. - [Kevin] My mother raised us right. To do the right thing. Every since I can remember, my mom was always making sure the three of us got along. Blood is thicker than wine. She always used to say that. A family is all you got. It didn't matter if the family was a little fucked up. It didn't matter to mom. She loved us all the same. Even though I sometimes suspected that Devon was her favorite. She would go on and on about her little star. And how smart and talented and so and so forth. And all the shit. But you can't really blame her. Not with Maurice around. They knew from the beginning that he was different. That's polite for maniac depressant. But frankly, I ain't never seen him depressed. He seems to be stuck in the maniac mode. With no off switch. And me? I was always the baby. The little Devon. Destined to follow in my big brother's footsteps. There's no denying that Devon got a healthy dose of the old man in him. My father. I don't remember much about him. I was too young. What I heard wasn't always good. Especially not the last thing. They said something about a drug deal gone bad. But how do they say? The seed doesn't fall far from the tree. That's true for all of us. Maybe, especially for Devon. People think there's no morals in the hood. There's a whole lot of morals. There's just a whole lot of poverty and crime that go with it. The bad part about the hood is not so much what's there, but what's not. Hope. Chance. A shot at a better life. That's what my brother had. A way out of this bullshit. - Hey, what's up? Can I get some of the loot? - Loot? It's all about the hustle. Look at them. Out there doing just what the white man wants them to do. Running. Jumping. Grunting, like some fucking animals. - Nah, yo. Not my brother. Look at him. He's doing what he's supposed to do. Staying in school. Getting that scholarship. - Scholarship? This only paper that count. You've got to use this and this to get it. Do you know what? When your brother blows his motherfucking knees out, he'll be back. Looking for me for some work. But I see something in him. He got skills. Street skills. - What? Man, what you talking about? Street skills. - He's playing the wrong game, your brother. He can't win playing that game. He gotta run his own. I'll show you. Call that fool over here. - Hey, Devon. - What's up? - Good shot. Too bad you can't buy shit with it. Whenever you wanna make some real money and control your own destiny you come see me. - Man, ain't no future in what you doing. Just a matter of time, bro. Just a matter of time. - Punk ass fool. (party music) - Hey there, super star. - Hey, how are you? - What's up, Paco? You can't speak. - I'm just mesmerized by this bright shining star. - There you go. - I'm just proud of you, dog. Keeping your eyes on the prize for so long. I'm just happy to see you raise up off these streets. - That's a toast to my baby. - Police. - Shit, it's the cops. - Got a call for a disturbance. The music is too loud. Is that weed I smell? - That ain't mine. - Whose house is this? Turn around, put your hands behind your back. You're under arrest. Possession of marijuana. - Man, what's up, dude? - Put your hands behind your back. Shut up. - No, you can't do that! (screams) - Get on the ground. - You all trippin', man. (girl screams) - [Female Officer] Get out of the way. Everybody out. Everybody out. Come on. - [Party goer] What you call taking my boy for? - Stay back or you'll go too. - Don't be like that. Shit, we can't kick it. - Get back. - [Maurice] Hey, don't hurt my motherfucking brother. Oh, man. Fuck! (phone ringing) - Hello. - Mom, yeah. You all gotta get me up out of here. - We're working on it, baby. It's gonna be awhile, okay? You just sit tight. We'll see you soon. - When's Devon coming home, ma? - I don't know, Kevin. Soon. - The judge is in a good mood today. And you're a first time offender. I just got the DA season tickets to the rangers. Okay? - Okay. - Your honor, the State v. Devon King. - All right, Mr. King, approach the bench, please. Mr King, it shows that this is your first offense. And believe it or not, I am in a good mood today. So here's what I'm gonna do for you. You're going to get deferred adjudication. However, should you ever appear before me in this court, regardless of the reason, even if it is for a speeding ticket, you will serve time in a correctional facility. You understand me, Mr. King? - Yes, sir. (bang) - Bailiff, next case please. - All arise. - Look here, little bro. I know I messed with you about a lot of things. Even when you was going to jail and all that shit, but I just want you to know. Even though, you know, you got fucked in the ass to shit while you was up in there, you're still my brother. I won't tell nobody. - Shut the fuck up, you stupid mother-- - I will not have this kind of language here in my house. - Why, Devon? Sounds to my like you're talking like a convict. - Man, that ain't funny. - Damn. - See, always gotta be playing. - Man, wasn't trying to hurt his feelings. - I'm sorry this had to happen to you, baby. You are one of the good ones. Don't you ever forget that. - Mom, I try so hard. - I know you do, baby. I know. But I know something else. You have something special on the inside of you. Right here. This is what you're gonna use to get out of this mess. You understand me? Hm? Tell me, who's your favorite girl? - You, momma. - I've gotta go. Don't you mess with your brother. - You know I was just fucking with you. - Yeah, but you play too much. - Look man, I fuck with you about a lot of shit because I know one of these days you'll get up out the hood and when you do, you'll be laughing at every motherfucker up in here. You know what, I love you and I got you a get out of jail present. Here, little bro. - Booty cream? - Yeah, booty cream. - Fuck you, man. Stupid motherfucker. (laughs) Stupid, stupid fuck, man. (sensual music) - [Voiceover] Yeah baby. I just wanna let you know. Won't be nobody coming in between us. No matter what they say. Believe that. ♪ I'll give my love to you and only you ♪ I'll give my love to all of you ♪ I'll give my love to you and only you ♪ I'll give my love to only you ♪ - I hope you won't be doing that to all the girls in college. - Only you, baby. - You know who tried to talk to me today? - Who? - That fool, Kiki. - So what you saying? - Nothing. He was trying to flash his cars and his jewelry in my face. I told him I had a man. - You shoulda offered that motherfucker some breath mints. (laughs) I see is nickel and dime, I'm gonna fuck him up. Damn. I've gotta go see my fucking PO tomorrow. - Look, you're a first time offender, so you don't have to drive up here every week. Just keep your nose clean and mail your paperwork in on time. Looks like you'll have me as your PO, so we might as well be cool. - All right. - All right, cool. - Appreciate it. - Thanks for stopping in. - Thank you. - [Kevin] Everything seemed to be going back to normal. It was like as if this all had been just a big dream. Thank God we awoke just in time before it really went bad. It turned out that Devon's new parole officer was a hard ass. Devon didn't show and that's all she needed. Devon was an issue right away. - Fuck, man. - Hey, what the fuck? What, did you speed? - No, I wasn't fucking speeding, man. - Just be cool, dog. - This shit ain't cool. Same old bullshit. - Cool it man. Here she comes, man. - Driver's license and registration, please. - What did I do? - I said driver's license and registration. Your tags are expired. - Didn't I just tell you, five minutes ago, to get that shit taken care of? - Shut the fuck up, Maurice. - This shit ain't cool. This shit ain't even cool, man. - Nigger, I'm already in trouble. Be cool. - Man, as long as she don't run all our names, man. Just let me handle this shit. Here she comes, man. - Here you go. I need to see the other two IDs. - What for? - Don't make this any harder than it has to be. I said I wanna see your IDs. Ain't this suspicious. Two brothers in the hood and a Mexican. What's the odds? - Shut up, man. You just can't do it, can you, man? She's gonna run some shit on us now, man. She runnin' all our names now, man. - You ain't got no warrant, do you? - I'm cool. She gave me my shit back. But what about you? - I hope no shit come up. - You the one, dog. Here she comes again. Be cool. She coming on the other side, now. - Which one of you two is Devon? I said, which one of you two is Devon? - You talking to me? - Yeah, I'm talking to you. You need to step out of the car. - Why? - Step out of the car. Do it now! Step out of the car. - For what? For what , though? - Place your hands, right here, on the side. Turn around, place your hands on the side. - For what? - I have a warrant for your arrest. - For who arrest? - Put your hands back on the side of the truck. Give me your right hand. - For what? - Give me your right hand. Do it now. Left hand. You're under arrest for your parole violation. - Parole? - What you arresting my brother for? - I have a warrant for your arrest. Let's go. - I ain't on parole though. - You guys go on. I'm gonna let you out with a warning. - What you arresting my brother for? - Get on out of here. Parole violation. Get out of here. Go. - Hey man, hey. Call momma. Hey, call momma! (door slams) - Court is in session. Please rise. - Be seated. Approach the bench. Mr. King. As I recall, I had you in my court room not that long ago. And, as I also recall, I told you never to appear before me again, regardless of the reason. Obviously, my warning had no affect on you and you decided not to comply with the terms of your parole. - But judge, I was-- - Silence. You will not interrupt me again, Mr. King. It is obvious to me that anything I say now is gonna be fruitless in your case. By God, I will be taken seriously in my courtroom. And if this means imposing the maximum penalty that the law allows, then so be it. Devon King, I hereby sentence you to 48 months effective immediately. - Forty? What you gonna do? 48 months? (yelling) - [Kevin] My brother always said, when God's really mad at you he don't send you to hell. He sends you to the pen. O.G. Larry turned Flakes on to the game. Larry's been running the south side of this city for five years, right out of the pen. And the reason why the cops couldn't find out who the biggest drug dealer in the town was was because his ass was locked down in Huntsville. When Flakes heard that Devon went up he asked Larry to watch out for him. Show him the ropes. Make sure my brother was safe. - Where the fuck is those cigarettes you owe me? - I'll get them for you tomorrow, all right? - Tomorrow's too late, motherfucker. - I'm serious. - I need my squares. You always gotta keep these motherfuckers honest. So you know what they thinking. You gotta get to a point where you know what they gonna do before they gonna do it. Know what I'm saying? - Feel you, dog. - Shit. - Hey, O.G. Can I get some squares too? - Fuck off. - Come one, crazy ass white boy. - Sometimes you can be as sharp as a knife in the drawer. Other times, you can be slow as a bowel movement. - Why you say that, dog? - I mean, you ask me about little man and the nation when you already knew the answer to that shit. - Duh, I know Slate gotta pay. But to turn him over to those stupid motherfuckers. Why, dog? - Why? Was it too harsh for you? Everybody that got anything in this country was taken by blood and force. Multiply that by ten and you got what's inside these walls. When it comes to money, green is the only color that matters. Business is business. The Aryans, everything is gonna be working smooth now. I don't like them no more than you do, but business is profit. Profit is money. Talk to Flakes. Said you gonna be a good hustler. Just need a little direction. Yeah? - Yeah. - Might be able to make yourself a little money. Might even make me a little money, huh? - You know what, dog? I don't mean no disrespect. When I get out of here, I don't plan on coming back. I'm gonna start from scratch, dog. Maybe even play ball again. Man, I don't know. Start over. - Start over and do what? Let me tell you something. The only way to get up outta here is to have the undecided determination to make it to the top. Three things. Be black and poor. Black and in jail or being black and dead. Five words, Devon. Five motherfucking words. It's all about the hustle. (intense hip hop music) - [Devon] Dear momma, Life's not mine anymore. Now that I think of it, never was. I admit, it's better to be free than in here. But I feel like I was still convicted as soon as light seen my face. They got me where they want me now. Stamped with a number. Eating, sleeping, drinking. Ruined for life. But I was that from the start. - What's up, nigger? - What's up? - How you doin', man? Dang, welcome home, man. Been missing you like crazy, dog. - Damn, you're big. You're taller than I am. You need some food. Where the food at? - Food in the kitchen. - Let's go eat lunch. - That's what I'm sayin'. - I'd like to work that ass, right there. Say baby, you late. - Nigger, please. (laughs) - Four years, same old tight-- - What's up, monogamy. What's up, man? - What's up, dog? - Aight, aight, aight. How you been, man? - Where Lisa at? You seen Lisa? - Man, ever since she went to college, man. I ain't seen her since. You being locked up for four years, I figured we'd kick it. Find some females. Start ratatataing some ass. (hip hop music) - Are we seeing ghosts? Devon King risen from the dead. - What's up, fool? - Sup. Hey, I just wanted to let you know I appreciate what you did. O.G. Larry looked out for me. - Yeah, O.G., that man's all right. So are you ready? - Ready for what? - For what? The game. - It's one thing OG Larry taught me, stay the fuck up out of here. - Devon, be you he'd teach you about this right here. I know it's been a long time. - He never taught me nothing about that either. - Don't lie. - All right, my ass you got handed, fool. - Holla. - Devon, stay up. - [Kevin] Our mom must have told him well. Even after everything he's been through, he was still trying to do the right thing. Still trying to be the man that he always wanted to be. - Well, my family is back together again. Welcome home, baby. - Thanks momma. - Hey, Devon. They didn't try to punk you in the ass up in there, did you? - Maurice King. - Mom, only a question. I was just wondering. Did we get Devon back or did we get Patricia back? - Man, quit playing. He just got home. Damn. - Ah, man. Devon, seriously, did they try to take your manhood up in there? - Maurice. - All right, man. I was just checking. - Always playin'. - Anyways, Coach Porter said that they're hiring down at the high school. I thought maybe you'd go down there and get yourself a job. You know, teaching the kids. - I guess, if you can't do it you could teach it, huh? But, Momma, I don't think nobody wants a convict around their kids. So, I guess my boy gotta get us that scholarship now, huh? - He's gonna have to. We sure in the hell don't have the money to pay for him to get in college. - Maybe if you save some of that weed money you're spending every week. You can help us out around here. - Maybe if I were Michael Jordan, I could buy everybody else in the Hood a scholarship. - Maybe you better watch your tongue, before I rip it out your motherfucking mouth. - [Kevin] Oooooh. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Lisa, it's Devon. - Devon? - Yeah, it's me. I'm out. - How are you? - Better, now that I'm out. You know? Well, I was wondering if I could see you. - Look, Devon, I don't think so. I'm going out of town pretty soon and I'm not really sure when I'm gonna be back. But I'll give you a call when I get in. - Yeah, sure. All right, peace. - Everything all right, bro? - Not anymore. - Okay, Mr. King. In the aptitude test, you scored very high. In fact, you scored higher than some of my supervisors. But there seems to be an irregularity in your work history. There seems to be a gap of three and a half years that's unaccounted for. Could you elaborate on this? - Look, mister-- - Mr. Jones. - Look, Mr. Jones, I'm not gonna lie to you, all right. I've been locked up for three and a half years. But, but, it was just a technicality. It wasn't my fault. Look, I don't steal. I don't do drugs. I don't sell drugs. I just need a job, bro. - Yes, I see Mr. King. But I'm gonna have to be frank. You are an ex convict. No mater how much you've reformed or how innocent you were, there's just no room for you in our company. I'm sorry, that's our policy. - But you just-- - I'm sorry. - Thanks. - I see. I understand. Yeah. Thanks anyway. - [Kevin] It's not that he didn't try. He was determined to play it straight. He put the same effort in as anything else he ever did. But he never had a chance. Nobody would give him one. I don't know for sure what made him do what he did, but I guess after everything he went through he needed only one more thing to push his ass over the edge. (club music) - What's up, Devon? Have a seat. - What's up, nigger? - Sup. - I know things have been hard. And I know people can say this is a dirty business. But you can always do something good with it. Like I do. Give back to the people. Let me give you a little something. Get you back up on your feet. - Take a look. - But there's four things you always need to remember. Never talk. Always listen. And I hate a fucking snitch. Boy, you gotta choice between living and dying. You better choose the one that's going to make you the most money. Welcome to the family. - I love you, bro. - Stay up, nigga. - [Kevin] I'm not sure, but I gotta feeling that the same place where Devon started dreaming is the same place he decided to get into the game. I guess he thought, where else would he get money? There was only one place to get it. - 230. Should we count it again? - No, you're money ain't never short. Hey Devon, I don't think they know who I am. (smooth hip hop music) - [Kevin] Devon had gotten good quick. Somebody tipped the police. But he didn't even panic. They called in a tip for a small bust two blocks away. But what police didn't know, there was millions in the building they had staked out all day. - Yo, Devon, it's all good. Whatever you said, it did work. Sure get the fuck out of here. We outta here. (club music) - Hey you, Devon. Pretty gutsy move you did today. We need to talk. Have a seat. Heard about the shit you did. You gave up three of our motherfuckin' keys to the cops. - Look, Flake. - No, you look Devon. You know what you did? Do you know what you did, Devon, the other night? You did what you always do. You used your motherfuckin' key. That's why we got you a little treat. (snaps) This is Roxanne. Shantae. Enjoy yourself. - Oh, damn dog. My nigga. (smooth hip hop music) - Ma, where do you want this at? - Honey, you can put it right there, on the right. - [Kevin] Money mysteriously started falling out of the sky for mom. She would never tell us how she got it or where it was coming from. But all of a sudden, we were in suburbia. We never heard another gunshot again. (hip hop music) - Mom. Who was that? - Nobody. - Mom. Where you been getting all this money from? - This is none of your business. Please don't ask me about it again. Why should you care anyway? Aren't you eating? Are you going hungry? You got brand new track shoes, football shoes, all the summer camps. You have everything you need, don't you? - But ma, I just-- - Don't you? - Yes, ma'am. - Hey, Moe. I've been meaning to ask you something. - Sup? - You know, Ma? I've been wondering where she's been getting all this money to be paying for all this stuff around here, lately. - Changes I love, bro. I have a fine ass female. I mean, a fine ass female. Bow, bow, bow. With no aids. Clean as a motherfucking virgin pussy. Come up to you and ask you to bruise her ovaries. Would you start asking a bunch of questions? Or would you start to ratatating that ass? - Man, Maurice, can't you just give me a straight fucking answer sometime? Damn. - Look, it's cool, boy, trying to swell up to me. You ain't swell, nigga. You ain't Big Moe. - Look, I heard a rumor. Me and you, we brothers. I just wanna know the truth. Is Devon still selling? Is that nigger still rolling? - What do it matter? It seems to me you already got every motherfucking thing. Jewelry, clothes, shoes. Don't you? - Yeah, so? - What the fuck you complaining for then? - Obviously missing the point. Look, we already lost him for almost five years. And now, look at this. We ain't got no phone call. He ain't come to see us. And everybody's walking around, acting like shit's all gravy. That ain't cool and you know it. And every time I ask, where the hell is my brother? I get some old bullshit answer like, Devon's working in Michigan? Devon's working in Georgia. Come on, now. I ain't stupid. I hear the rumors. I seen the money. - This motherfucker is fucking up my life. Look at you. Acting like you dying of thirst. Bitch because it's raining. You wanna know where Devon been for the last five years? Huh? He's been making sure your black ass is having a chance to do things he ain't never had a chance to do. - Look, just tell me the truth. Stop beating around the bush. Is Devon selling? - What do it matter? It seems to me you already know every motherfucking thing. You figure it out. - Whatever, man. Just fuck it. Forget it. - Hey, Devon. Yeah, I was thinking, you need to take a trip back home. Take care of some of my business with Larry. See some of my people while we out that way. Yeah. What? Yeah. Yeah, last night, you had a bad bitch. At the titty bar. G-Diddy Bar. Yeah, baby. Oh yeah, I'm gonna pick her up tonight. I'm on my way. Oh yeah, she a dancer. Yeah, you know how I like to do it. Oh, you took care of that for me last night? Yo, Devon, you're my man. I knew you was always one step ahead of the game. Yeah, you got a lot of street skills. Stick with me. We gonna make a lot of money. A lot of money. I'll halla back. Peace out. Oh, yeah. (motorcycle engine) - Hurry up, girl. (gunfire bang) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Kevin] Like most games, this game is played hard and fast. Things can change in the wink of an eye. (hip hop music) It wasn't long before Devon opened up shop again. He hooked up with Flaco, made him his right hand man. He even brought Maurice into the picture. Bring him in as the muscle. (motorcycle engine) - Got to stretch them hams at least 30 seconds. Skip on them hams, through, boy. So, what? You gonna stare at me all day? Or are you gonna give me a hug? - I'm not sure. So I guess I'm gonna stare at you. Where you been, Devon? Or better yet, what you been doin'? - Seems like you'd be jumping for joy to see me. Looks like you're pretty disappointed. - I've been working real hard all these years you've been gone. Just so I can be what you wanted me to be. - Oh what, you ain't all right? You got that scholarship, don't you? You clean. You still in school. You ain't hurting for shit. - Can I say the same for you? I been hearing rumors. But I gotta hear it from you to believe it. Devon, are you a drug dealer? - Yeah, Kev. I'm a drug dealer. - All that money you gave momma, all them opportunities you claim you made for me, it was all drug money. Drug money. - Let me tell you something, little nigga, I was robbed. I was robbed of my future. I was robbed! And I'm making it so that you don't be robbed. - You were the hope, Devon. You were the hope. You did what you had to do, no matter what anybody had to say. You ain't had no excuses for nothing. And I believed in you. I believed in you. But you gave up. I gotta go, big bro. - Kev. Kev. You don't understand, Kev. - [Kevin] Devon was gonna have a sit down with Kiki and let Kiki know who was the H-N-I-C. - Yo, what's the deal? You know what I'm sayin'? You gotta problem? You know what I'm sayin'? Is you all disrespecting me tonight? - No, man. It ain't like that. - Okay. - Consider this a new business arrangement. I need to work things where I need to work it. It'll be better for everybody. - Check this all out. I know you work for O.G. Larry. You know what I'm sayin'? But he down in Huntsville and Flakes is probably halfway to hell by now. So what you saying to me don't mean shit, right now, dog. - You know what? O.G. Larry is staring at you, in your face, right now. And another thing, you say anything else about Flakes, I mean anything else about Flakes, and you'll be apologizing to him, personally. - Hold up, hold up, dog. Put them down. Put them down. All right, Devon. Hey, it's cool, dog. You know what I'm sayin'? You've got the upper hand. Know what I'm sayin'? I'm gonna roll with the tire, baby. Till it start flowing another way. Wait, hold up, you know what? You all have a good time. Hey, peace. Hey, Devon. Davon? Devon, right, okay. Your girl, Lisa, I mean, my girl Lisa. She told me to you her love. She got love for you. You know what I'm sayin'? Let's go. You have a good time. Give me that phone, my nigga. I gotta call to make. - Word. - You can crash at O.G. Larry's pad. I got the keys. I got her number too. If you want it. - Yeah, good shot, man. - Good job. - Good game, fellas. Good game. - I got net. - Ain't you a little passed your prime? - I can hold my own. - We'll see. Check ball. (hip hop music) - Hey, get up off me, man. What's up, dog? - See you ain't going by the book anymore. - You won. That's all that matters, little bro. - I guess so. It ain't always been that way. (laughs) - Sorry ass fucker. - Come one, y'all, let's play ball. - Shit, haven't done that shit in awhile. - Devon. Devon King? Detective Freeman. I need to talk to you for a minute. - I don't talk to detectives. That's my man's department. This is Flaco. Flaco, you know this fucker? - Let me see, man. Nah, we all booked up this week. - I don't need to talk to him. I need to talk to you. We can do it here or downtown in the box. It's your choice. Hey, look. How many crack babies did you make today, huh? How many kids you kill? You wanna talk about that? - Man, we gotta go through this again. - Yeah, we do. Sit down. - I don't wanna sit down. - Sit your ass down! I just don't understand you. I guess I'm supposed to. We both came up in the hood. Just look at you. A drug dealer. That's right, a drug dealer. And me, a cop. How do you suppose that happened? - Simple. One is with the system. One's playing it. - No, nothing in life is that simple. Life's about making choices. - Choices. Man, let me tell you. Some choices just may fail. - Yeah, all right. Now you gonna tell me, just cause you black and you went to court looking for justice that's what you found. Just us, right? - Justice? Let me tell you something about justice, Mr. Freeman. Aight. In this hand, I got cocaine. Pure, uncut powder. In this hand I got cocaine. Rock, hard, cooked. Over here, this is what white people do. This is what they said. Over here, this is what black people do. This is what latino people do. This is what they said. The difference between the two? I can have two kilos of this, get two, three years. Two,three ounces of this, get 25 to life. Now, everybody in this hood know about this. And you trying to tell me about fucking justice? - See, that's where you're wrong, Devon. See, justice doesn't come from out. It comes from inside. It's about being responsible for you actions and don't what's right. - Doing what's right? The same motherfuckers telling me to do what's right is the same motherfuckers trying to keep me locked the fuck up. - Heard that. - Look, I'm not gonna argue with you about this. I'm the law. You're the crook. One of these day, I'm gonna bust your ass. - You know what? That's what makes it so interesting. - I'm gonna tell you two things, Devon. - Oh yeah? What? - This shit don't last forever. I'm gonna be all over you like stink on shit. - Good luck, motherfucker. - You done fucked up! You are in a serious type situation. You are a stupid motherfucker. Nigger, you owe me and you owe Devon. You know what. You in this situation. It'll be about time for your ass to die. But I know your momma. So I'm gonna give you a choice. - Man, Kiki, dog, whatever, man. Fuck it. Whatever, dog. - Put your hand back. Got him. - Ah, looks like you pissed off the wrong motherfucker. - Oh, you look like shit. You know, you don't have very many friends around this town. We gotta call that lead us straight to your ass. So, here we are. - Look, J-Man, make this easy on yourself, all right. Maybe save us some time. Now look, hey, we know you don't have enough weight to be moving this type of shit, okay? Somebody does. Be smart, man. Maybe tell us who that is. - Or you could go down, do some time for this shit, that this guy set you up for and while he's out here laughing at your dumb ass, you're in there getting pocked. - Man, listen, I'm not gonna tell you guys shit. Unless you all can offer me some kind of protection or something. - Who the hell do you think you are? Henry Hill? We aren't promising you anything. - Look man, can't make any promises right yet, okay? You give us what we need and we'll probably work something out, okay? Can you give us a name? - Fuck it. All right, fuck it. I know this guy. His name is Devon. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Hey, you need to bring your ass home. - For what? - I don't know man. Momma's trippin' again. - About me? - I don't know. Come home and find out. - Hey baby, what's up? - Nothing, what you doing? - Nothing much. What'd you do today? - Went shopping. Run some errands. You know, same old, same old. - So, you heard who's back in town, right? - Yeah, I did. - So you know who I'm talking about, right? - Yes. Devon. - Have you seen him? - Let go of my arm. - It's cool, baby. Have you? - No, Kiki, I haven't seen him. - And you don't plan on seeing him, do you? - No, Kiki. - And if you did, you'd let me know, right? - Yes, Kiki. But why would I do that when I have you? - That's the question I been asking myself. Shit, you go cook in there or something. - Hey mom. - Sup, ma? - Boys, I'm gonna make this plane. I'm gonna say it one time and one time only. I don't wanna have to go through this again. What have I taught you all ever since you were little? Kevin? - Blood is thicker than wine. - That's right. But look at you. You're all sitting here like strangers. Can't even look each other in the face. - I'm looking, ma. - Shut up, Maurice. There's problems between the two of you. You all are gonna have to work it out. You have no choice. We're family. You all don't know what this is doing to me. It's breaking my heart seeing you all like this. You hear me? - Ma, we'll work it out. I promise. Right, Kev? - You two, you're gonna have to talk. You're gonna have to work it out together. Maurice, I need you to take me to the store. - Mom, we just came from the store. - Maurice. Let's go. - Yes, ma'am. - Motherfucker, we family. You understand? Family! No matter what I do, we're still family. We brothers. Like it or leave it. Kid, you know what? You act like I just love what the fuck I do. Just one day, I decided I wanted to sell fucking dope. Nigger, I was supposed to go to school, be with my girl and play ball. Not none of this other shit. Shit just fucked up. It just happened. And I got fucked in the process. You don't understand what I'm doing. It ain't for me no more. - I ain't ask for that shit. You think I asked for my brother to be a fucking drug dealer? Just so I can get some fucking new sneakers. Man, look, I don't hate you. I hate what you do. Cause I try so fucking hard every damn day to not be who you are. - I'm not worried about you being like me. That's why I do what the fuck I do. So you won't have to be like me. Look at you. Look at you, nigga. You doing good. You don't have to worry about shit, now. I couldn't say the same for myself. Fuck it. - Remember when I was young? You used to work with me on my skills. You remember you used to tell me, you gotta play with the pain. Cause soon as you play with the pain, you realize it wasn't as bad as you thought it was. Well, you know what, big brother? I just you woulda took you on that advice. - Yeah. No, nigger, you know I'm just kicking it. Nigger, I'll call you back. Lisa? - Devon. - What's happenin'? - The first time you got arrested, it was like some type of freak accident. I mean, nothing like that had ever happened to you. So I didn't take it very seriously. I just thought everything was going to be okay. And then the second time, you were sentenced. I couldn't believe it. It was like some type of horrible nightmare. You walked out of that courtroom and never came back. In that instant, everything that you had worked for, all your hopes and all your dreams were taken away from you. And mine were taken away from me. Baby, I lost all direction. I didn't finished college and I didn't get that great job. I just sat around here, feeling sorry for myself. And then Kiki. He just kept pursuing me and pursuing me. So I gave in. - Out of all people, why Kiki? - He was there for me, Devon. He was just there for me. I need to know if you're here for me now. - Always have. (phone dial) - Kiki, what's up? Yeah, I see youe hoe in here getting her brains wooed out by my man, Devon. So you need to handle that when you get a chance, partner. Yeah. (knocking) (knocking) - Shit, hold on. - Devon King? - Yeah. - We have a warrant for your arrest. - Hey man. What'd I do? - Smoke? - No, they might kill you. - Not if I kill you first. Well, Mr. King. Got a dope case pending. Got one count of drug trafficking. Organized crime. Possession. Possession with intent. Looks like one of your boys done turned bitch. And that's a sad, sad song for you. But you could make it better. Tell me who's supplying. (laughs) Come on, Devon. You owe me. You owe me and every other black man. The shit that you do. You are our drug problem. And you're gonna fix it. - Hey, Freeman, would you do me a favor? Why don't you go down the street and get my lawyer. (laughs) - You want me to get your lawyer? Yeah, sure. I'll get your lawyer. Your fancy, fancy lawyer. He might be able to wheel and deal and you cut a little deal or anything. But with all his talk and all his wheeling and dealing, it still doesn't change what you are. - You know, my friend, I don't owe you shit and I don't owe no motherfucker that wears that badge, shit. You motherfuckers owe me four and a half years. Cause I was a productive citizen. I was a model citizen. I believed in justice. Justice fucked me. So fuck you and what you talkin' about. - Just keep running your game. Just run your game, Devon. See, the only problem with running the game, somebody's gotta win and somebody's gotta lose. Guess what? You got blood on your hands. - Hey, Freeman. You ever kill anybody? (Devon laughs) Man, what the fuck do we know? - I think I know who snitched. - Who? J-Low. - J-Low? Oh, I know where the fuck this shit coming from. Let's ride, man. - You know what? I'm about tired of your motherfucking ass. I gotta motherfucking war going on. My niggers dying in the street every day. I'm taking care of your ass and every time I mention motherfucking name, you get this look in your eye and then try to play me like I'm stupid and I don't know you fucking this motherfucker again. - What are you talking abo-- - Bitch, don't play me. You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You Kiki woman and don't you forget it that shit. When I'm motherfucking dead and gone, you aren't gonna have no one else to love but me. Okay? Get the fuck out of my sight. - [Kevin] Devon didn't wanna just kill Kiki, he wanted to make him sweat. He started the war just to make a point. He could have Kiki wacked, easily. But he wanted Kiki to suffer. Problem was, Kiki wasn't going out easy. - Beat it, bitch. Yeah, man. This motherfucker got a hardon for you. This little motherfucker, J-Low, apparently owed Kiki some loot. Kiki made J-Low pinks. Turned state's evidence on you, then go for immunity. Stupid motherfucker. Kiki gonna end up wacking him anyway. We almost go him but the CO saved his ass before we could finish the job. But he probably under lock and key somewhere, though. But look, get this motherfucker. - Yeah. Much love O.G. Appreciate it, bro. (phone ringing) Hello? - Okay, Devon. Here's what we got. You're facing two counts of organized crime and seven counts of trafficking. - What? - Two more guys rolled over. - Who? - That is the least of your concerns. Whoever the prosecution has been talking to, they apparently know more about you than God himself. - Well, what can we do then? - I don't know. The whole case is not entirely clear at this point. I'm gonna have to talk to more people. I'll be in touch though. - Yeah, all right. - Devon, look, just do yourself a favor, please. Remember, you hav a dope case pending. I mean, just keep a low, low profile and whatever you do, don't do anything stupid. - All right. - You see that guy? (gun shot) - What the fuck? (gun shot) (gun shot) (gun shot) (screaming) (gun shot) - All right, you know what to do. - Here come that fucked up, punk ass, Freeman. - What? - Freeman. - All right, send that motherfucker here. Freeman. Have a seat. What you doing here, man? - Devon, look, I came here to talk with you. I understand you feel like you got a raw deal. You had to do your four and a half, five years. But that's all water under the bridge. One of these days, somebody that won't have nothing to do with this shit is going to end up getting killed. Just a matter of time. - But? What that got to do with me? - Still running your game. You know, can't you stop the bullshit, just for once? Can't you just be serious? - Be serious, huh? Well look, friend, I know who you are. And you know who I am. So where do we go from here? - Where do we go? I'll tell you where we go. We'll stop all this killing, okay? Need to stop all this drug selling. You can stop that. You can stop our drug problem. (laughs) - I'm the drug problem, huh? - Yeah, that's right. - Man, you blind. Man, why the fuck you always lecturing me and never arrest me? - Two reasons. One, saves me and the department a whole lot of aggravation. And two, I understand what you've been through. I've watched you. I think there's some good in you. - Well look, my man. You've just about exhausted all your time and I've got things to do. So-- - Devon, this is your last change to do something good. I mean, how long are we gonna keep killing each other? How long are we gonna keep selling drugs to each other? - As long as there's drugs, it'll be so. - You know what, Devon? This shit don't go on forever. The next time we meet, it's not gonna be like this. - Devon. Lisa. - The fuck happened to you? Who did that shit? - Kiki knew I was over here the other night. He's been making me pay ever since. - No. Look. Hey. You don't gotta take this shit. Why don't you get your-- Better yet, don't even go back. I'll buy you new shit. Kiki on his way out and you know that. Hey, I need you to stay here. You'll be safe with me. You hear me? You know you're my girl, right? - Maybe this war is getting out of hand. Really. We lost a lot of good men. I don't know what we waiting on. We can take this motherfucker out anytime. - Let's end this shit, Devon. - Fuck it, then. Let's end it. - Aight. (door bell ringing) - We'll work that shit out. We'll work it out. - Hey yo, Devon, man, it's your mom and your brother. - My mom? Hey, what the hell they doin' here? - Ma? What're you doing here? You gotta go, ma. You gotta go. - No, Devon, I need to talk to you. Your brother, he's scaring me half to death. What is going on around here? - Look, both of you gotta go, now. You gotta go now, ma. - No, I'm not going anywh-- - [Devon] This don't concern-- - [Momma] Dosen't concern me? You are my child. Everything you do concerns me. I don't care what you say. I ain't going nowhere until my family is back together again. - Ma, you gotta go. (gun shots) - Momma! (gun shot) Ma! Ma! - Come on, get up, momma. Momma? Momma, get up. - [Kevin] Get off her, man. You fucking killed her! You fucking killed her! - Momma. Momma! Ma! Ma. Who's gonna take care of Kevin and Maurice? Momma. Hello? Flaco, listen. I need you to get everybody together. Yeah. Gonna have a meeting. I need some food, some drinks. I need to speak to everybody. What? Where he at? Is he there right now? (foreboding music) (gun shots) (gun shots) Give that to him. - [Devon] Don't say anything, kid. Just listen. Everything I did was for you. I'm sorry I disappointed you. And I'm sorry about momma. I want you to go on and have a good life. I want you to continue to be the good man that you are. I don't give a shit what you say. I'll always love you. You bet I do. - What's up, dog? - Sup, little bro. - Hey, check it out. The reason why I got you all here is because I'm through. I'm out. I'm turning everything over to Flaco. You all listen to what he say. He got you all. He'll keep you all going. I want you to take care of my brothers and my momma. - Done deal. - Aight? - Yup. - What you talkin' about, Devon? - I'm just tired. - Tired of what? - Tired of this shit, man. Tired of going up stream. It's like I'm floating up stream by myself. Tired of innocent people falling for my mistakes. Look at momma. What would happen if something happened to you and Kevin? I don't know. I'd probably go crazy. Who knows? You know? Fuck that, it's over. One thing, you know, you all remember this? - We all remember that. - Straight robbin'. - That was my man. I love the nigger. This, I'm gonna give to you, dog. Check it out. All you all, man, stay up. Don't fall off for nobody. I care about all you all. - Sounds like you're dying, man. - No, nigger ain't dying. (police sirens) (police sirens) - Hey man, why the police outside? - What's up, man? What you gonna do now, Devon? - I guess I'm gonna turn myself in. - What? - Do something for me. Tell Kevin I love him too. Do that for me, all right? - Yeah. - I'll go turn myself in. That's all. Keep them inside, all right? - What you doing, Devon? - Get back, man. - What did you do now, Devon? Devon! Huh? Devon! He dropped the clip. Devon, what you fixin' to do, man? - Devon! Freeze! Come one, we need to talk. (police sirens) Come on, I just wanna talk. Come on, we got this place surrounded. Look at it. How long have we worked on this? Guys, I got this. I got this. Come on out. Doesn't matter what happened. Just come on out. We need to talk. We've been working on this too long. Can we just talk? I got this. - I need to see him! Devon! - [Freeman] Devon. No, no, no! (gun fire) (Lisa screams) - Oh, baby, Devon! No! No! (police siren) - Why? Why, Devon? - I guess I solved your drug problem, huh? (somber music) (police radio) (police siren)
