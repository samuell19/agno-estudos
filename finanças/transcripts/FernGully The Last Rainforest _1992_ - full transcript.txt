[ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Rain Pattering ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Woman ] Our world was much larger then. The forest went on forever. We tree spirits nurtured the harmony ofall living things, but our closest friends were humans. Then, as sometimes happens, the balance of nature shifted, and Hexxus- the very spirit ofdestruction- rose up from the bowels of the earth... and rained down his poison. The forest was nearly destroyed. Many lives were Iost, and the humans fled in fear, never to return. Most think they didn't survive. It was onIy by calling up the magical powers of nature... that I was able to trap Hexxus inside an enchanted tree... and save FernGully. Which is why it is so important for you to learn to use these powers. I won't be around forever, and you'll have to- Crysta? Yes.
