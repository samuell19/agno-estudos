- This is sure going to be good. - Junior knows how to do things. Murray! Look at this! Good boy! That's enough for today. Come! Here you are, Jake. Here's yours. Here you go. That's for you. Here we go. Vincent! Did you come from home? How's my brother Jeff? Has something happened to old Mercedes? Why did you come here? Who sent you? From Carradine. He says I have to come here quick. That's all he says. Why does Carradine want me to come back there? Why don't you answer?! Tell me what's happened! I don't know, Tom, I don't know. Then you and I can go back to town! I'm never going back to that town! Come in! Hello, Murray. What's this all about, son? Why do you want to leave? Is something wrong? An old friend of the family has sent me a note. He says I have to come home. Home? Who do you have at home? My brother Jeff and our old Indian nurse Mercedes. Jeff has some land and a nice house. When my mother died, she had been a widow for years, she left everything to him and made me swear that I'd go away. Why? Not enough land for two? Oh, yes, there was enough, but I had money. They sent it to me wherever I was. Didn't you ever go back home? Once for a few days, years ago. I'll be back soon! Goodbye! Take care. Bye, Tom. Take care of yourself, son! Excuse me, isn't this the farm of widow Corbett's son? No, mister, it's Scott's land. I'm talking about Jeff Corbett. And who's that? This land here belongs to mister Scott now. Do you know where I can find Jeff Corbett, please? I don't know who this man is you're talking about. Get going! Ask them. Thank you. Can you tell me where I can find the widow Corbett's son? I'm sorry, we're not from these parts. Hey! Anybody know the son of widow Corbett? Yes, I know! He works as a blacksmith with the old Chinese fellow, at the corner near the saloon, behind the Scott bank. Thank you. Where are you going? Back to town? You're a stranger, but you better learn some things quick. When you see that sign, don't pass through unless you're invited. That sign means you're standing on mister Scott's property, and mister Scott doesn't like people trespassing on land that belongs to him. So long. Don't forget what I said. Where did you steal the horse? Good morning. Good morning. I'm looking for Jeffrey Corbett. He should be here. But as you see, he is not here. Where can I find him? You follow the smell of tequila. Where does he live? He has a house. However, who knows if he lives there! You go on road to west, it's outside of town! Hey, stranger, you mustn't run away like this without you doO your duty. Information costs 20 cents. I don't work for nothing. What... if I don't give it to you? Confucius say: "If you want to live a long life, try to be ignorant and know nothing." But in this town, you have to know a lot of things to live a long life. Twenty cents, please. It's Scott. Hold it! We're leaving, mister Scott. We can't get along on what we earn. Working for you don't yield us anything. But you can't leave us like this, my good friend. What's your name, hmm? Farr, Jeremiah Farr. Well, Jeremiah, you see, there's plenty of land around here: Fields to cultivate, virgin lands to be cleared, herds to tend. That's true, mister Scott... There's plenty of land, there are fields to cultivate, herds to tend, but not when it's Scott's lands and herds! My son is right. We're going. It's a pretty place and we're sorry to leave it, but we can't do otherwise. But, Jeremiah, how can you leave land where you lived so long, land where you've buried your dead? None of my dead are buried here. One will be now. A new customer. Long life to you! Come in! It's open. Who are you? What do you want? You want a drink? No one wants nothing. Don't drink. Who are you anyhow? It's Tom! Hello, Jeff. Jeff! Tom! When are you leaving, Tom? I just got here and now you want me to leave. You have to go, Tom. You can't stay here. It wasn't my idea to come. Carradine sent me a note. He said to come and I'm here. I was worried about you two... Why are you living in this shack?! I heard ma's farm belongs to somebody named Scott... You had the right to sell it to anyone you wanted, but why to a rat like Scott and a hyena like Junior? You have to leave, Tom, and quick. You mustn't let yourself be seen around here. Did you meet anyone you know? No, I didn't meet anyone. Alright, I'll go outside now and get your horse ready. I'm not going any place, not before I've talked with Carradine! Don't you fight, not you two. I've got to see Carradine. Well, boys, having fun? Hey, bartender! Tequila! Here. Hey, bartender, give me a drink, will ya? Hey, you! Give us a light. I don't smoke. Hey, tequila! I'm thirsty. excuse me. Two! Come on, let's go home. No-oh... I was having fun. Listen: Confucius say: "He who is always strong of heart can defeat an army.” But as usual he was wrong. Everyone needs a little help. One dollar a shot, please... I'm putting it away for my old age. One... two... three That's enough. I have to shake those men off and get to Carradine. Yeah, go ahead. Your horse has rested long enough. You had a good time with your friends at the saloon. I'll say goodbye to Mercedes for you. Let's shake hands and then you get out of here. Get out of here! NO. Now, while I'm gone you stay out of trouble. Thanks, oh lord, for the food which we are now about to receive. Amen. Tom! I've been expecting you. come in. Did anyone see you? I don't think so. Wait a minute. We can't talk here. Let's go to the hay loft. We can go around the back way. Come on, come. What is it, mother? Carradine! Scott's men... Your favourite piece, isn't it? You taught it to me, holding me on your lap. Remember? Son, I want to talk to you. You want me to finish the piece. You always used to ask me for it, until a few years ago. You're grown up now, Junior. You love me, daddy? I want to talk to you. What is it, daddy? Aren't we still one? Remember, you and me, not you, not me, both of us. You pushed me away from you! You mustn't do whatever You feel like, son! You told me I was the boss, that I was in charge. There is a limit to everything! To everything, daddy, to everything... Not just to what I do... understand? What are you trying to say? What you are trying not to say. Please, daddy, don't put yourself against me. I love you. Let's finish the piece together, shall we? What's going on around here? Why did they kill the Carradines? Why didn't they get rid of us at the saloon? And who's Scott? What have I got to do with what's happened? When will it be my turn? When?? You can rest easy, they won't shoot at you. That's right. They don't want to shoot at me. But why? Want a drink? You must give me a hand, Jeff. If you want a hand, I'll give you one. I'll go and get your horse ready, so that you can leave. Tomorrow I'm going to see Scott. At least he'll be able to tell me something. Well, I think I'll go to sleep. Goodbye, mister Carradine. Good morning. Confucius say: "Burying the dead is a gratuitous and meritorious task.” But Confucius, of course, didn't live in this town. Burial takes up much of my time, and unfortunately I have to make it profitable. Confucius will surely forgive me if I say that the Carradines' funeral costs three dollars a coffin. Which comes to... comes to... er, twelve. Thank you. You know how to live. Now, can you tell me where to find Scott? Have you a million dollars? What? Confucius he also say: "There is no amount of money that can equal the earthly life of a man, even if he is very lowly." And I am very lowly, but for this once I heartily agree with Confucius. What will you have to drink? Whiskey double. How is Mister Scott? Fine, I think. Where can I find him? Find who? Doesn't this saloon belong to Mister Scott? What saloon? Can you give me a little scotch, chubby? Yeah. This place is mine, too. My name is Tom Corbett, Madam. Can you give me some information? Depends. Where does Mister Scott live? Now that's not a piece of information. What is it? Much more and much less. You see, Mister Corbett, in this town everyone knows where Mister Scott lives. What do I do then? What do you do then? Well, if no one has told you, I'm not going to be the one to do it. Nobody wants to tell me where to find Scott. But if I have to ride all over New Mexico, I'll find him. Yeah, sooner or later. Why don't you come with me? We'd never get to him. Why not? Too many guards. They shoot on sight. I'll go with you. With you, I'm safe. Alright. Shall we go? Why not? I've got to see Mister Scott. Sorry, I haven't been told about that. I've got to see him. If you really had to see Mister Scott, he would have told us about it. I can't let you go on. Do you really want to see Scott? Why, of course I do. But the way things are going, I reckon I'll never get to see him. Will you take the responsibility for the death of those six men? Take the responsibility? Before who? Before Scott. If he asks, tell him it was you who took care of them. The things you have to do for relatives. Hey, gentlemen! Shall we go on? You see, over there are three more. Want to ask I f they're going to let you pass? No, you don't feel like making conversation. Wait... Hey, gentlemen! Whiskey’s no good for me. Now, if you just keep on going in that there direction, you won't meet anyone. A few miles and you'll find yourself in front of Scott's ranch. And you? I'm going back to town. I'll take the long way. I wouldn't want to meet up with any trouble! Howdy. He's not one of the guests. I suppose not. I remember as if it were yesterday. There he was, a grown man. And he'd never in his life been in a big town. He was so confused and flabbergasted that he mounted his horse and headed straight back for the desert. Yes, I remember him vaguely. Why, you weren't even born then. I... I have to talk to you, Mister Scott. Young man, as you can very well see, I've got guests. I'd be glad to listen to you some other day. Now, if you'll excuse me... Well? Didn't you hear? Get out! Go on, give it to him! Give it to him! You're doing fine. I must say, he's very obstinate. It serves him right! May I? That's enough! No, Mister Scott, he must get up by himself. Had enough? That's enough! You can't whip him like a dog! Mr. Scott says that's enough. I'll be back... Tom! I'll see Mister Scott tomorrow. He had some guests for dinner today. Junior's good with a whip, ain't he? Tom, come to bed. You mustn't see that man again, Tom, you mustn't. Leave right away. Do it for your poor mother and for me. Tom, get out of here quick! Get away, you! I'll come with you... What have the Scotts got against us? Scott killed my father. No one ever told me that... our father had been killed by Scott. It was my father he killed. Who's that up there? Is Scott with them? I can't tell from here. We're just going to have to find out. Come on. This way! Hey, gentlemen! Mister Scott wants to see you! Nothing doing! Let him come here so I can put a bullet between his eyes. Scott is your father. Mister Scott told me to tell you that he has to speak to you about something very important in person. Come out, Tom! I have to talk to you! Please! It was me who sent for you. I told Carradine to look for you. I want you to come live with me. We've been separated too long. Ask that rat, your father, about Mercedes! I don't know anything, I swear it! I'll get the murderers, I promise you. Come with me. Everything, all I have, belongs to you, my son. Junior is mad... Now I understand everything. Everything make sense? Scott sent for me. Junior killed Carradine and then Mercedes. Mercedes knew. Yes. Junior wanted the whole ranch for himself, and when he realized that a part or all of it was suddenly slipping out of his hands he killed his father. And I'll kill him... Aren't you going to come along with me, Jeff? Revenging Scott isn't any business of mine. What would you do in my place? I'm not in your place. Even if it costs me my life, Junior will pay for this. He's your brother, do what you like with him. Hey! I've changed my mind! I want to make sure you don't give your brother any special treatment! See you at the ranch! You attack from outside, and me from the inside. From inside? I'm going now. You keep shooting, and from different places. Make them think that we're together. Shoot with the rifle and the pistol, both. Get it? I get you. I'll see you later. Hey, gentlemen! A little politeness will get you anything. This way, quick! You! Go that way! Hey, gentlemen! Hey, excuse me! You take him! You go out there. I'll cover your back. It's family business. It's up to you. You can't kill your brother!
