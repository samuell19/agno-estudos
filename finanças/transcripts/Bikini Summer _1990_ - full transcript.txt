THEME SONG: Ooh. Just too hot. Yeah! Don't you feel the summer sun now calling out to you? Take a walk on the wild side of life. Don't waste your time cruising the city streets when there's someone waiting for you in the summer heat. You won't believe what you've been missing all along. Take my hand, I know we can't go wrong. Bikini Summer when the days are never tame. Bikini summer is calling out your name. Bikini summer when there's always more to show. Bikini summer is hotter than you know. Oh, it's so hot. [inaudible] There's a place you've dreamed of not so far away. Where all your fantasies come true. Come see the waves crashing when the surf is high. You can feel your heart is pounding, I can hear your sighs. There's nowhere else I would rather be. Just open up your eyes, there's so much you can see! Bikini summer when the days are never tame. Bikini summer is calling out your name. Bikini summer where there's always more to show. Bikini summer, it's hotter than you know. Chester. Chester. Oh, right. Number two sandpaper for the spackling. I totally agree. Mrs. Patterson and I had moved on to a discussion of proper technique with the paint brush. Uh, I knew that Mr. Patterson. Chester? Chester, Mrs. Patterson and I will be returning on the 17th. That's not a long time. We trust that you and your friends understand the amount of work involved here. Oh, we do, Mr. Patterson. We do. Good. Now just a few more thoughts on vertical versus horizontal brushstrokes. When using an oil based paint, the vertical stroke, no more than eight inches in length-- Wendell, I think you mean horizontal for oil based. No dear, I recall very plainly Mr. Wilson down at the paint store telling us-- Mr. Wilson was the nice man at Carpetland, Wendell. Mr. Cummings was the gentleman at the paint store. I'm afraid you're mistaken. I distinctly remember Mr. Wilson telling us that in his youth he had used that particular brush stroke technique. Whoa, look at that time. Don't you two jet setters have a plane to catch? Chester, we've got three hours. Three hours? To LAX? Maybe Chester's right, Wendell. If there's one thing I know, Mrs. Patterson, it's traffic. We'd all be heartbroken if you missed that big bird to Italy. Greenland, Chester. We're going to Greenland. Greenland? Right! Boy, do I envy you. Now don't worry about a thing. By the time you get back, me my friends will have this place looking new. Your father said we can count on you. My father speaks the truth. Now get out of town, you two. I just hope we're doing the right thing, Martha. Don't worry, Wendell. Chester and his friends seem like fine, responsible young adults. [burps] It's got to be around here somewhere. Did you see my camera, Renee? Chet, be careful! I've got all those fabrics in order. I can't figure out where it went. What do you want with a camera anyway? I've never seen you take a photograph in your life. I've always admired the art of photography. Oh, really? And is that why last semester, instead of attending the Ansel Adams exhibit with me, you went the monster truck rally? It's never too late for one to begin to express their artistic sensibilities, Renee. Chet, this is me you're talking to, OK? Not one of your bimbos. And I seem to recall the last time you became obsessed with your artistic sensibilities. Beginning figure drawing wasn't it? I find nothing wrong in trying to capture the human female form. Uh-huh. In stick figures? This has really got me nuts. Chet, I've got work to do, OK? Maybe it fell out of my bag when we were bringing our luggage in. Richard, my camera's disappeared. Consider the earth's rivers, Chet. OK. It hasn't helped. I still don't know where it is. That's not the point. I figured it wasn't. Think of death-- death to all those rivers, rivers dying because of chemicals. And where do you think those chemicals come from? I don't know, Richard. Where do the chemicals come from? From factories, Chet. The same factories that process film-- film of the kind you're going to use in that camera you're looking for. Thank you for that, Richard. I do what I can. [music playing] Jazz? Jazz! Jazz! Will you stop bugging me, Chet? I've got a rehearsal coming up, and I got to learn this piece. Jazz, I'm looking for my-- [groans] Chill! [gasps] How dear you walk in here without knocking? I was just-- I'm trying to get ready for the beach. Do you mind? I've already wasted valuable tanning time. Sorry. OK. All right. [music playing] Thanks, Mad Dog. You've been a really big help. [burps] [music playing] Major fox alert, dude, 9 o'clock. 9:00, Gary. You were looking at 3 o'clock, dirt face. I'm sorry, Larry. I always forget. You see that, dude? That chick's sending heat signals to yours truly. Wow. What are you doing, Larry? When a chick wants you, dude, she's not going to just walk up and sit on your face. She's going to play hard to get. Foxes want to be chased. [music playing] Absolutely beautiful. Are you talking to us? How would you two feel about being on the cover of a national magazine? You really think so? Come on, you guys are gorgeous. Do you really shoot magazine covers? Yeah. I've been lucky. I've been known to start a few film careers. So do you want to shoot us? Yeah, sure. We'll do it right here. You give me your phone numbers, I'll give you a jingle when they're ready. We'll have some pina coladas and talk about your futures. So how do you want us? Just the way you are. [inaudible] absolutely! Make love to the camera. Yeah! [inaudible] There's great exposure here. Gorgeous. Hey, you guys need a break or something? How about those pina coladas? At least the other lame-os use that national magazine cover line had enough sense to take off their lens cap. Hi there. Oh, hi! You come here often? Sure, I do. I live in the house right over there. Well, then I'm sure you want to read this. It details over 37 deadly traumas your skin can suffer when exposed to excessive sunlight. And then of course, there's the sand, which harbors a variety of poisonous insects, many of which carry the bacteria commonly associated with the plague. If you guys play really loud-- Loud as we can. Good. I've been trying to buy out the guy next door for the last 10 years. Now maybe they'll sell. This place is really incredible. Look, showers and everything! Nice, all right. Oh wow, how are we going to pay for it? We'll get a gig. We haven't gotten one yet. Well, listen. We've got to practice some more, you know? I mean, listen you guys, all we need is a few more songs and everything is going to be cool. Now this one is my favorite. Also the most romantic of mine. You're on the beach, and it's been a long, hot day. You've got a really nice tan, and you've been swimming, so you feel great! Alive. And it's that time in the afternoon when the light rolls in, and you're walking back to your blanket, and this guy who's been watching you all day comes up. Maybe you talk a little. Maybe you watch the sun go down together. You feel really good-- warm, like the sun. Yeah. Tropical Affair. That's what I'll call it. Tropical Affair. Thanks, Mad Dog. You've been a really big help. Look at her, dude. Just sitting there, playing it cool. But I know that, deep down inside, that babe is dreaming about having my children. Do you girls have any idea what dreadful damage extended exposure to the sun can cause? What do you take us for, morons? We're more than aware of the dangers inherent in sunbathing, which is why we've taken the precaution of covering ourselves with sunblock. From head to toe. So the harmful rays of the sun can't penetrate. To harm our tender young flesh. Well, what about dolphins then? What about dolphins? Mary is a marine biologist with a specialty in aquatic mammals. And so if there's anything that's troubling your teensy little mind-- Rainforests! What about them? Hundreds and thousands of acres of pristine natural timberland is being destroyed. At a rate of 50 acres per day, which is robbing our planet of valuable life giving oxygen. And contributing to the destruction of our ozone layer. Aluminum. Every day, hundreds and thousands of tons of-- Of aluminum cans are being shoveled into landfills, where-- They'll remain there without decomposing for at least 30,000 years. Yes. Perfect. Beautiful! So when do we find out if we're going to make the cover? Oh, it'll be awhile. You know publishing. Bummer. That happened to me once. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I was out of film. I knew that. [inaudible], listen. This is OK and everything, but if we could go back to your studio, we could do some really sexy stuff. Yeah, I bet you could get us into "Playboy." So where is your studio, Chet? Uh-- Mark, Mark! What's going On It's happening, dude. She's looking right at me, smiling. She's burning up, dude. She's making her move. She's coming for my hot, throbbing love. I knew she couldn't hold out. Hey, mama. I'm Brad. And I'm in love. Geez, Larry. He's even prettier than she is. Chill out, dude. OK. [music playing] How many times do we have to go through this before you guys get it right? Take it easy, Jazz. Take it easy? It's the same mistake every time. All it takes is a little concentration. We're trying our best. Well, I'm sick of it! The rehearsals, brain's on vacation. The whole stupid thing! Cranky, cranky, cranky. Not her fault. Look at her love life. What love life? Tell me about it. If I hadn't had a guy as long as she has had, no telling how cranky I'd be. You? I'd probably be out stomping on cute little puppies. Or running over old people in my car. I'd probably just get a gun and-- OK, OK. Screw off, all right? Now, are we going to play this thing or what? Until I finish my post-doctoral studies in Europe, I plan to settle in one of the Latin American countries, where I hope to use my engineering skills to help the Native Americans. Reclaiming their birthright in a way that will have positive environmental consequences. Well, you two seem to have a handle on all the major issues. So I'll just mosey on down the beach and see if there's any slackers that might need my help. Nice meeting you, then. Yeah. Bye. Geez, he's the third environmentalist we've seen this week! And so far he's the only one we didn't sleep with. For such a well-informed guy, he is kind of-- dumb? Chet, what are you doing? You ever know a photographer who didn't have a studio? When I meet a real photographer, I'll let you know. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos, save the beach. Stop the condos. Save our beach. Sign here. They're building condos on our beaches? 1,000 units, man. Tennis courts, parking lots. The real bummer is the mini mall. We get enough signatures on these petitions, and we get a hearing with the city council. How many do you need? 200. How many do you got? Counting you? Eight. We got a [inaudible] early this morning. I, for one, can't stand by while our pristine beaches are being devastated by greedy money interests. You know, if you don't stop them here, our entire marine ecosystem will be destroyed. And not only that, the beaches will become play lands for the rich and the poor will be confined to the inner city, festering and sweltering and oppressed! The cities will burn, and the only consolation being that the rich will destroy themselves in a degenerate quest for the perfect tan. Man, you are one committed human being. You know, if I don't start selling those bikinis soon, I'm in big trouble. You? I just spent over $200 on all this stuff! I'm supposed to be sympathetic? A little support of my artistic dreams might help. You mean wet dreams. Don't you, Chet? Whatever. It's still costing me a ton of bucks. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. Save our beach. No condos, save our beach. No condos, save our beach. You do not have a permit for this assembly. You are now ordered to leave this area or face possible arrest. The Constitution of the United States of America. My name is Rachel Green. I'm the assistant district attorney, and you are in violation of Sections C, F, and G of the city penal code. Illegal assembly, illegal obstruction of a public thoroughfare, and in violation of public noise abatement laws. You are in violation of our constitutional rights as citizens of the United States of America. Without a proper permit, you have no right to assembly. Link arms. Power to the people! Come on, man. Let's-- let's go back to my pad. We'll mix up a batch of nice cold martinis and we'll watch the sun go down. These are the oppressors, man! Listen. I spent half the '60s in the slammer. I missed Woodstock. I missed Monterrey. I don't plan on missing the '90s. Thanks. Well, Martin Luther King you're not. Can't you see what's happening here? The bashing of the baby seals! Dolphins in tunafish cans! Holes in the ozone layer! The suffering of our Native American Indians. And now this! It's so obvious! Book him, Danno. Cuff him up. Book him, Danno? That's Officer Bill Danno, and so help me if I hear so much as one crack out of you, and I will personally see to it you spend 48 hours in the tank. Get him out of here. MAN (ON RADIO): [inaudible] Bitch! She knows I hate it when she says that. So I guess I'll see you at the party tonight. - Are you asking me out? - Yeah, sure. Then I guess I'll be there. All right. [revs engine] I'm sorry. Can I help you kids? Oh, no, that's OK. OK, then. I'll see you around. You see, I told you that woman really wants me, dude! You wait here, Larry. I'll go get the Yugo. OK, girls. For the last time. [music playing] (SINGING) It's the politician who pulls your strings. It ain't any one gives you money, sex, and things. Big business is the earth's decay. You've been bought to look away. Hey baby, you busy tonight? Thanks, but I already have a date. So? So? See you around. Well, if you want me, you know where to find me, sweetheart. (SINGING) --are growing strong. Making me start to lose control. Just a [inaudible] if you got cash. If you don't, your head will bash. Mr. Bush does not tax the rich. Isn't that sort of a bitch? Seems like everything is going wrong. I've got restless feelings in my soul. Rage and anger are growing strong. Making me start to lose control. Hey, do you two guys know a guy named Brad? Sure, why? Because I just can't find him, and I'm supposed to have a date with him. Well, we haven't seen him. Sorry. (SINGING) I've got restless feelings in my soul. Rage and anger are growing strong, making me start to lose control. Lot of [inaudible] [moaning] Oh, yeah! I can't believe it, just look around. A lot of BS is going down. Pull your head out of the ground. I'm losing control. So? I don't know. Almost there. Almost? We have played this song 350 times. My fingers are so cramped they feel like rigor mortis has set in. Come on, Jazz. We're tired. Give it a rest. All right, all right. But if we don't hammer this song soon, I'm going to lose my mind! Oh God, what a day. Phew. Tell me about it. [music playing] [laughs] [moaning] Oh god, oh! [moaning] [laughter] [music playing] [inaudible] put it in gear. All right, all right. Cool off! [music playing] Thanks, Renee. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Hey, you were fighting for what you believed in. Yeah, all by myself. I got to get these people committed, or this beach and every beach in the world is going to turn into one big fat condo complex. OK, Richard. But you have to understand, I can't afford to bail you out of jail any more. There must be some way to get this bitch organized. [music playing] [laughs] [music playing] [giggling] [moaning] Hey, baby. Brad, I've been looking all over for you. I was just taking a little nap. Brad? Sweetie pie? A nap, huh? Honey bumpkins, have you seen my earring? I don't need this. Come on, Michelle. Be cool. Michelle, don't be a downer. [music playing] [laughs] Oh, I forgot my shampoo! I'm going to go get it. Hello, Max. Having fun? Hey, did you ever find Brad? Tell me something. What is it with good looking guys, huh? They think that all they have to do is smile and every girl within 100 miles is going to stand in line. Looks like you found Brad. No wonder that creep is going to let us pay at the end of the month. I thought something was strange when he said he loved our music. Did you see the look on his face when you called him a perverted slime bucket? How about scumbag from hell? That was a classic, Jazz. Yeah, but the fact is that we lost our rehearsal hall. Come on, Jazz. That dirt sucking pig deserved everything you threw at him. We could have showered at home. We'd still have a place to practice. But, as always, I had to go and lose my cool. [piano playing] Ugh, oh, mm. [music playing] How dare you spy on me! - But it's my pool. - Oh yeah? If you live here, then how come I didn't see you at the party last night? I was up in my room working all night. It was my brother's party. And I suppose now that you've seen me naked you think you can just jump my bones, right? Listen, I just got this great idea for a song. I've got to get back to the piano to work it out, all right? - A songwriter? Yeah. Geez. What a lame line. You really think I'm going to fall for that? You're all the same. If it isn't pretty guys, it's lame lines. I'm sorry. Just cool down, OK? Right. And now you probably want to give me a massage to make me relax a little, huh? But you're badly mistaken if you think I was born yesterday. Put it on, OK? Oh, the perfect gentleman bit. You think I haven't seen that one? You need something to wear! Oh no fun if you can't talk me out of my clothes, is it? I read you like a book, mister! Because if there's one thing I know about, men. There's one thing I know. It's women. They have to be posed very carefully to highlight every nuance. What are we going to wear? Huh? We're certainly not going to wear these. Yeah, big time photographers always have lots of neat stuff to wear. Oh. Uh, right. Where did I put my-- stuff to wear. [knocks] Art waits for no man, ladies. Just one second. OK, we're ready. [music playing] Boy oh boy, I just had this great dream where this girl was-- Chet, we're all so delighted that your sort of little subconscious made you so happy. Is summer over? Or what? Considering the fact that my bikinis were stolen? Yes! I'd say summer is definitely over. I suppose it doesn't much matter. I didn't sell any anyway. That shouldn't be a problem. According to the girls I shot this afternoon, they loved them. - They stole my bikinis? - No, no, no, no, no. I stole them. I mean, I borrowed them. Renee, you're a hit. Don't try to squirm out of this! You probably gave those Barbie dolls bikinis because you couldn't pay them. Actually, they paid me. I wanted to return them because they offered me twice your price. They really liked them? No kidding, they flipped! I swear, if we could just find a way to show off those bikinis of yours you'll-- so simple! It's brilliant. A bikini contest. We'll [inaudible] the bar someplace, and you'll sell as many bikinis as you can make! Just where are they going to wear these bikinis when they turn our beach into a parking lot for condos? We'll make the contest a fundraiser. We'll raise money to help save the beach! Yeah! And then I can get everyone to sign the petition! Of course we're going to need some music. I wonder if anybody around here knows of some hot young band. All right! We're going to need contestants. Of course, you probably don't want to enter. No. Sure. You don't want to spend your evening with a room full of environmentally conscious men. No, on second thought, it's better that you don't enter something like that. I mean, the crowd would just be totally uncontrolled. OK, OK. I'll [inaudible]. [laughs] I don't suppose you have an angle, do you? Me? No. Organizational stuff. Radio, possibly a little TV. Maybe shoot a calendar with the contestants featured! Media tie-ins, merchandising tie-ins. [inaudible] What about Mad Dog? [inaudible] [burps] It's just so strange. Like a big boy or something. And the living room looks so much larger. I wonder where he went? All I know is he was gone when I got up this morning. Mad Dog went to go see a man about beer. All right? Now will you two just go away or something? I cannot concentrate! God, what's the problem with her? I'll tell you what's wrong with me. Does this look even remotely sexy to you? Have you tried it on yet? No, but yeah, maybe that's a good idea. You won't? I will. Don't waste your time. All washed up anyway. My mother said I should become a librarian. Now I know she's right. Two more years of college, buy myself a nice quiet little town with a stuffy little library, spend the rest of my life telling little brats to shut up. I'll probably die an old maid. A very wet old maid. [shrieking] [music playing] [shrieking] [laughter] [music playing] [shrieking] Maybe you're right. Maybe you are all washed up. Get away from me. I don't want to hear anything about skin diseases or insects who carry the black plague. The last time I talked to you, I couldn't sleep for three days. No, it's not about that. It's a bikini contest to raise money to help save the beach. Save the beach? What do you mean by that? From the developers. From the ruthless, capitalist exploiters, the land bearers. The oppressors of the working man everywhere. With their running dog lackeys and their tired political bosses, driven only by greed. Couldn't I just enter the contest for fun? Well, gosh, yes. I guess you could. Thanks. And listen, if I see any running dog lackeys in the neighborhood, you'll be the first to know. Oh my god. She's coming towards us, Larry. What are we going to do? And I hope to see you both there. Maybe you two could do me a big favor the night of the contest. Sure, no problem. Great. Just come early, OK? And ask for Sheryl. Thanks, Sheryl. We'll be there. [music playing] Well, I must say. I'm surprised at you. You certainly [inaudible] for such an obviously sexist event. But it's to help raise money to save the beach. By exploiting the active use of women's bodies for the lustful cravings of chauvinistic male morons? But-- In other words, we think it's a great idea. Where do we sign? [piano playing] [knocks] Hi. Hi. Oh, here's a robe. Thanks. Uh, listen. I've got to get back to work on this song. Just one more thing. There's this contest tomorrow night. Bikini contest? I'm in it. And I thought, if you weren't too busy, maybe-- Well, I don't know. All right. Just thought I'd ask. [music playing] I just finished counting the profits. We make some kind of team. That's great, Renee. I thought a celebration might be in order, my treat. Maybe some other time. OK? Look at yourself! Every time you look at one of those Barbie dolls in a bikini, you get that same moronic grin on your face. My god, Chet. You really do only have one thing on your mind, don't you? [music playing] [cheering and whistling] [cheering] [inaudible] sign the petition? [inaudible], dude. Where do we sign? And don't forget, guys. Chet Marley Productions is proud to support the Save the Beach foundation. So during the course of the evening, get on over to pick up your t-shirt and your hot bikini calendar. And remember, for every dollar, we donate $0.25 to help save the beach! Save the beach, save the beach, save the beach, save the beach, save the beach, save the beach, save the beach. Now, now, now. For our first contestant, let's give a big welcome for Sherri! [cheering] Sherri is a fine arts student at UCLA. Sherri, what turns you on about a guy? I like guys who can really appreciate that beauty mother nature has created. Like the beach we're trying to save here tonight. I wonder, could there be any guys in the audience like that tonight? [cheering] Take it away, Sherri! [music playing] [whistling] [cheering] Thank you, Sherri. And now, our second contestant is Sissy. Now Sissy, you study law. Why is that? So I can fight all those mean developers that want to take away our people. [cheers] Anybody interested in fighting alongside Sissy? [cheers] Go for it, Sissy. [music playing] And this is being brought to you by Live on Renegade Radio, Malibu's own underground station, 102.8 FM. [cheering] And here's our next contestant, Becky! A bio chem major from Pismo Beach. [cheering] And next we have, Shannon, an aerobics major? Right. [cheering] There just seems to be so much fabric. Any less fabric, and you'd be naked. Maybe then I'd have a better chance. And here's Holly, a budding young actress from Muncie, Indiana! So when you go on? In awhile. I wish I'd never entered this thing. Come on, Sheryl. You look fantastic! It's not what I mean. Maybe if I just lost my top. [music playing] And now, you all know her, Malibu's own, Cheryl. [whistling] [cheering] [cheering] [commotion] [commotion] Chet, what's happening? I don't know. We're hereby ordered to leave these premises in a peaceful and orderly manner. She can't do that. Can she? If you do not disburse immediately, I will initiate arrest proceedings. Wait a minute. Are you the organizer of this affair? Yeah! I mean, I-- You're in violation of municipal penal code Section F, Paragraph 13, perpetration of a lewd and licentious display. Wait a second here. My bikinis are not lewd and licentious! And just who are you? I'm Renee, Bikinis by Renee? I designed every one of these bikinis. I made them and-- And contributed to the exploitation of women. No! My bikinis are-- beautiful! Then why aren't you wearing one? I-- I'm not in the contest! And maybe that's because you have no desire to cater to the prurient interest of this-- this mob! You are hereby ordered to be quiet. I am ordering silence! [commotion] Shut up! I have here in my hand a court order instructing me to repossess the musical instruments belonging to the band known as Jailbait? [commotion] Come on, lady. Give us a break. Unless you can produce eight months of overdue payments amounting to $900. Officers? No, wait, hold on! $900, the repossession papers please. Hey, listen. I don't know who you are, but we don't have any money, and-- Consider that money an advance against your royalties. Royalties? Yes. I heard you guys playing on the radio on my way down here. You're great. Wow. Do you know who that is? Do you? Sure. It's Burt Harden. "Midnight Love"? "My Sunshine"? "My Inspiration"? He's written songs for everybody. My lawyers are drawing up the contracts now. They'll be ready in the morning. And I want you guys in my recording studio tomorrow night. That is, if you'll sign. All right! [cheering] Quiet! I want you all to return to your places and be quiet! [cheering] I will not tolerate this noise. What's he doing here? Let me through here. Let me through here. Hey, hey, hey. Officers, give me those petitions. Give me those petitions! These subversive beach bums, they screwed up my condo project. It's not fair. You are the developer? You can use the rehearsal hall for free. Why, you slime ball! You dirty, perverted sleazebag! You, you! You exploiter of the people! You exploiter of the people and decent women everywhere! Max, what is she talking about? Tell her, Max. What? I was trying to fix the electrical wiring. Right. And the hole in the wall just happened to be in the shower room, and you just happened to be peeking through it while we were taking showers. [boos] You're going to believe this little twerp? What I may do is bring you up on some pretty nasty vice charges. Not to mention invasion of privacy and solicitation. Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Dad? Sh. Shut up, you little sponge! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Stop the condos, save the beach! Section G, Paragraph 2. Without a proper license, it is a felony to sell beer or any other alcoholic beverage. Mad Dog! In a business establishment, a place of entertainment-- [police radio] [country music playing] Therefore and hereupon, unless a proper license to sell beer is produced, I will order this establishment closed and the arrest of the offending parties. [commotion] Well now, just hold on a dang minute there, sweetheart. And just who are you? Conners. Big Earl Conners, but my lady friends just call me Big. [laughter] Mr. Big-- I mean Mr. Conners-- you're obstructing justice here, and if-- Whoa, girl. I just came down here today to make things right with Mr. Dalton. I'm telling you this boy's got the fire of a preacher in him. Ain't nobody held big Earl's ear for that long a spell. Three full hours on this here bikini contest alone, and he's got me calling up my buddies at the brewery bringing in beer and setting up hot bikini contests all over this great country of ours. [cheers] I'm telling y'all, the boy's a genius. And I'm proud to have him as my new vice president in charge of world wide marketing. [cheering] Then he shows me pictures of these two fine young ladies here, and my big old Texas heart got to throbbing something awful. I'm telling you, the boy's a genius. You're obstructing justice here, Mr. Conners. And if you-- Well, bust my boots. Mr. Dog here had me so all fired worked up over this here bikini contest, financial potential, globally speaking, I plumb forgot to give him his license to sell beer. [cheering] Yessiree, Mr. Chet's going to be our official big time photographer. And whoever made these fine upstanding bikinis, well, I'd sure like to talk some business. I made them. Renee! [music playing] And I just want to thank you for making me realize there's nothing wrong with feeling good about yourself. [cheering] Whoo-ee!
