Ta-dah! Hmm. Not a happy birthday for me. So working's more important than me? Well, that's it. She can tell me to my face. Hmm? Hey, chief, the corporate stock is down, way down. We're in big trouble. Tell me something I don't know. It's below the issuing price, and falling. Call the department heads, meeting in half an hour. Yes, ma'am. I'll get right on it. Mama, mama, someone's calling you. Answer the phone. Mama, mama, someone's calling you. Answer the phone. Hello. Hi, rainie. Why weren't you home yesterday? And don't tell me you forgot. It was my birthday. Oh, I apologize. I'm so busy. It's been a disaster here every day. It's the company stock. I'll make it right with you as soon as I'm done with this. I don't care. There's always something going on. Your job's more important to you than I am. If not, then come down an pick me up. I'm in front of your building right now. Excuse me? You mean, you're downstairs? Oh, my. You think I'm kidding around? I'm your daughter. Hold on. I have to take this call. Hey, where's that monkey I need? I'm sorry, sir. I contacted the supply house this morning. They promised it would be arriving here at any moment. Why is the chief's daughter here? Hmm. Straight to the lab? Yes, sir. I understand. I'm less important than a monkey. Sorry, dear. I'll send Justin down for you. Rainie? Rainie? Hello? Justin, I'm sorry, could you go down and get rainie? She's at the front entrance. Sure. I haven't seen her for a while. And don't forget the meeting... Everyone up here in 30 minutes. But what about rainie? - Please, Justin. - Okay, okay, I'll take care of it. - The monkey's here, sir. - What are you waiting for? - We need to proceed at once. - Yes, sir. I'm the only one with vision... a bunch of fools. Dimensional portal experiment 601 ready to launch. I hope this attempt is finally successful. I must say, all these failures have been pretty frustrating. But no matter, it will all be worth it once I'm holding that new d.N.A. In my hand. Then I will have saved the company and everyone will be so thrilled. Can't you speed it up? Every minute that goes by is costing me a fortune. Failure is unacceptable here. Oh my gosh, I'm talking to myself. Come on now, hold still. Don't run. Oh. Oh, brother. This is ridiculous. What is the matter with you? Oh, that's it. You think you can run? You're wrong. Where do you think you're going? I showed you. I'll never forgive you, mama, never, ever, ever. Never. That's what I'm gonna do... I'll just run away from home. She'll miss me when I'm gone. Huh? What in the world is that? A meteor? It can't be a u.F.O. Well, whatever you are, help me get away from here. She's gone. What are you talking about, "she"? What's happening here? We didn't send the monkey. We accidentally sent chief Warren's daughter through the dimension. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me who we sent through. I only care that the transmission was successful. Ouch. That really hurt. Where am I? Huh? Uh, never seen this place before. Whoa. Wow. Wow. Cool. Oh. Hmm? Hey. I hope I'm not imagining all this. Wow. What? Oh, where in the world am I? Oh. Mama. - Where's rainie? - I couldn't find her. All I saw out there was her bike. Oh, she's determined to upset me. Where could she have gone? Don't worry. I found her phone. It'll be okay. I was the same way. When I was upset, I'd go hide. Usually it was somewhere in the house. You should go home and check on her. Go ahead. We'll be fine here. I'm sure she's some place safe. My town's been invaded by a monster! Is it gone? It was awful. This place is turning out to be really creepy. - Gotta go. - Oh! Who are you? No time to explain. You run that way. I'll distract it. That thing's pretty fast. Don't worry. Just run. Hey, big mouth, you think you can catch me? Well, come on, give it a try. You have bad breath. I don't know what you've been eating, but it isn't gonna be me. Hey, can't he follow directions? What's happening? I thought he was gonna distract him, not send him after me. Help! Somebody help me! He would have swallowed me whole. Oh. Thank goodness I was able to get away from him. Now, wonder what happened to that strange blue boy. Watch out! Oh. Monsters are popping up everywhere. What are you doing? Play time. Let's go. We should be safe here. Oh, boy. That was weird. I haven't run that much in... ever. I'm walking from now on. Hey, can you get up? Hmm? Uh... Thanks. You're a pal. Oh! The main course you brought back last time was very stringy and tough on the teeth. But this one looks quite mouthwatering, kind of small, but I think there's enough to fill us up. It was really hard to catch. Let's not cut it into cubes this time. I think we should throw the whole thing in the pot. - It's so tender and fresh. - They're gonna eat me. I think the best thing we can do is steam it. I've got to get out of here. Ah, very good, my dear, just in time. You finally woke up. Get away from me! I'm not your dinner! - I know kung fu! - You got this all wrong. I just wanted to tell you that dinner will be steamed, not fried. Dinner is served, hot and steamed. I don't eat meat. I like veggies. - Glad to see you're all right. - Wait a minute. You're the one who knocked me out. Why did you do that? You were sort of out of control. I thought it would be easier. I used my hunter's training. Your what? You think I'm some sort of prey, is that it? You got this all wrong. He would never think of you that way. He's my grandson and he's shaking in his boots. His name is blue. What's your name, by the way? My name is rainie. Are you sure he's your grandson? I mean, you don't look very much alike. So what? I'm eco-friendly, that's all. You see, it's just a question of genetics. Am I right? There was a mutation involved? Uh, that's what happened, of course. But that's all ancient history. At the moment we have dinner on our minds. I'm sure that many things here you'll find quite delicious. Plus, today is blue's birthday. Right. How nice for you. I hate birthdays. Mm, I presume you know the birthday song. Uh, of course. Doesn't everyone? Great. So we can sing it together. Happy birthday to blue. - Sing. - Oh. Happy birthday to blue. ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪ ♪ happy birthday dear blue ♪ ♪ happy birthday to me. ♪ Ahh. Now you're another year older. It warms my heart to see how much you've grown. Do I hear someone's belly growling? - Blue, are you hungry? - Only for the last hour or so. - Then let's eat, come on. - Yeah. Rainie, you too. You can have your fill of anything on the table. You're too polite to eat without permission, not like some folks. Hey, don't complain, buddy. Listen, messing with you is fun. - I've noticed that. Fun time is over. - It's just begun. - Yeah? - Yeah. Huh? Guess I showed you. Say what? Think you're the best eater? My chopsticks will leave you in the dust. Time! Thank you. Those monsters... Were they dinosaurs? What? Now I don't know what you ran into, but I can assure you they weren't dinosaurs. They may have looked like dinosaurs to you, - but they weren't. - Are dinosaurs some kind of pets? They couldn't have been, because you're not on earth anymore. What? Not earth anymore? Then where are we? Mm. There goes the last of the dinner. We're on the jungle planet. Not that long ago, I found a dimensional portal between here and the earth. I traveled here to study the native species. You can go home in three days. - Really? - Don't send me back. - There's nothing there for me. - No family? Attention, group picture. Say "cheese." - Limburger. - Cheddar. Swiss? Oh, I'm in the middle of a cell test. Go to bed as soon as the cake is finished. Don't forget, save me some. And whether you like it or not, when the portal opens in three days, I'm sending you back to earth. And then this fool had the nerve to question my judgment in regards to the direction of the company. Once this new strain of DNA is in place, he won't dare open his mouth. We'll be so successful, I'll banish him to our branch office in Siberia. So when can I expect to have this DNA avail...? How often have I told you this? Stop disturbing me. It won't be long. I'm nearly there. Yes, yes. What's that? You say you're almost finished? I knew it! You're a genius, doctor! Let's see. A dash of iodine mixed with a free agent. And now a sprinkle of sodium chloride. That was more than a sprinkle, but whatever. Oh, it's reacting. Aha! That tastes like success. It's perfect. I am a genius! I did it! Yes! Aha! You did it? We did it! We did it! You're the greatest scientist in history! It's amazing. This hot sauce - will take over the world of condiments. - What? You made hot sauce? That's your experiment? - Oh, boy, what a breakthrough. - Hey, zip it. Are you completely out of your mind? You fraud. The reason you got funded is because you swore you could isolate an entire new strain of d.N.A. Instead, you're making hot sauce? My friend, getting your shorts in a twist won't help solve this puzzle. You need the seeds of wisdom. Then go open the portal. I'll send my personal bodyguards. They'll help you gather up these seeds. No, no, we can't disturb the balance of nature here. I'll go look for the seeds of wisdom tomorrow myself. By the way, a girl somehow got in the portal and was transported here. You'd better find out how that happened. Send some men to the portal terminus in three days. That's when I'll send her back. A girl? Oh, so she made it. Hmm, that means we can control it. You guys, open the dimensional portal immediately. Rainie, rainie. Where are you? What game is this? Why is she being so mean? Oh. Oh, rainie, it's all mama's fault. What's going on? No, grandpa, I like steamed better than fried. It tastes better. No, please. Just leave it alone. Don't touch the sacred tree. What happened to rainie? If not for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. Rainie, what are you doing there? I wasn't sleepy, so I came out here to watch the moon for a while. Shouldn't you be looking up then? Uh... That's the way. Just a little bit more now. Hold on. You sure seem to get yourself in a lot of trouble. What are you talking about? I can take care of myself. You wouldn't have gotten stuck if I'd been here. I couldn't sleep. When I woke up, the moon was so bright. It was beautiful. So I crawled out. Tell me, how come this place has three moons? Is that weird to you? I enjoyed watching them with grandpa when I was younger, but, you know, we haven't done that for a long time now. - How long? - Three days. - Gee, you must have been just a kid. - I was. Maybe he wants to come now. I'll go see. Hold on. Don't go. It's late. So? I'm sure he'd come out. Are you all right? Are you tired? Why not go back to bed? I'm not tired. I'm worried. I don't want to go. I don't want your grandpa to send me back to earth. You haven't got a clue. It's "grandpa this, grandpa that." Have you noticed I never even talk about my mother? - Never met my mother. - Move it. Why don't you want to go home? Don't you think your mom's worried? She's not worried. In fact, she barely knows I'm alive. All she really cares about is work, work, work. Yesterday was my 12th birthday. And you know what? She completely forgot. I'm just another chore she has to fit into her schedule. Most of the time she ignores me. I don't even care anymore. You're lucky. I envy you. You have a grandpa who loves you. Well, that's it. I don't have to take this. I'm gonna start a new life. I'm not going some place where I'm not appreciated. But grandpa is determined to send you back. Not if he can't find me. I'll run away. I'll have an adventure. Yeah, you can be my guide. Adventure? No, no, no, no. It's scary out there. Not as scary for me as going back home. I'll go alone if I have to. You coming? Uh, okay. I'll do it. You are my first friend. And also, you're a girl. But listen, we shouldn't leave here before morning. The creatures around here get wild at night. I'm not scared of that. I'm a female superhero. Sorry. In that case, welcome to team rainie. By the way, rainie, happy birthday. Huh? Oh, thanks. Huh? You're up finally. And we're still gonna have that adventure. I came up with a destination for us on the map. Huh? Whoa, where did you learn that? Wish I had some hairspray. I feel all frizzy on top. - It looks nice. It really does. - But I'll get used to it. Excuse me? Did you just say something? No, I was talking about my dagger. It's a nice one. And it'll come in handy. Grandpa gave it to me for graduation. Excuse me? What did you graduate from? - Oh, no, we can't go there. - Why not? Too dangerous. You could die in the fallen forest. How about the falls or the wetlands? Look, there's lots of wildlife. You could see a worm with six eyes, also a moth that flies upside down, kinda. - Hmm? - I'm just saying... But I suppose we can go to the fallen forest. There you go. Now we're getting somewhere. There is one problem. - Which would be? - The whole area is protected by a huge bottomless cliff. We'll never get past it. Blue, I'm going to the fallen forest today to collect some samples. You and rainie watch over the house. I will be home for dinner. That means we have a ride, so the adventure's back on. When you put it that way. Whoa, can't go without my knife. Will you get it in gear? Do you have any weapons you can bring? I'm just asking. Here we go, my friend. I hope it's the last time we're forced to do this. I have to tell you, we're way too old to be doing these dangerous expeditions together. Why did you make this secret tunnel so small? I can barely get through. Hey, move your tail feathers before I bump into them. This sure doesn't seem like a tree house. It's more like a big cave. Blue? Blue? Argh! Yow? Crud, you should be scared. I need more practice. Ha! Why am I so dizzy? Surprised, blue? Let that be a lesson for the future: Don't scare girls who know kung fu. Ha! I'm so scared. You can't catch me! Where are you going, smart aleck? Where you can't find me, that's where. Don't hit the face. Anything but that. I'll give you my desserts for a year. You can wear my hat a week. - Just don't hit the face. - Wow. This is amazing. Where are we, blue? This is the heart of the tree mansion. Grandpa told me that when he first saw it, he couldn't believe his eyes. He did an isotope test on it, and it turns out to be over 1000 years old. - Kind of cool, isn't it? - Way cool. Oh, well, gotta go, or we'll miss our ride. Come on. Whoa, how deep does this go? I can't believe it. It's like a bottomless pit. This bridge is kind of shaky. What if I slip? It's a long fall. This is nuts. They'll never be able to find me. Well, up to you. But listen, this bridge is the only way to our ride. It's part of the adventure. Great explorers are always careful. How do you think they live so long? Out of the way, four ears. - Move it. - You sure? Just be careful. Rainie, rainie, use your brainie. Do you plan to keep going? Fine. Watch out! Are you all right? Just fine. Whoa! I don't understand. You're nearly there. Why are you going so slow? Zip it, pal. Oh, we got over. Didn't break a sweat. I was just waiting for you to catch up. Less talking, more walking. We have a ride to catch. You ready? - Okay, run as fast as you can. - Gotcha. Here. Tiny space. Surprised? Yeah, kinda. The science geek has a secret lab. Grandpa's not really a geek. He's a respected scientist. Sorry, that came out wrong. I didn't meant to insult the man. This place is interesting... All these machines. This is just a little of what he's got. If we get a chance, I'll take you to his main lab. That one's a whole lot better. I was wondering what my grandpa does every time he goes to the fallen forest. - He never takes me with him. - Why can't I open this? Oh, those are sample containers. The green light indicates whatever's inside is in good shape. The red light indicates something's wrong with it. Hey, I found it. Don't mess with those. You don't know what kind of trouble you could get into. I wonder why this is so important. Hey, what are you talking about? The things grandpa's trying to collect. I think he's after the seeds of wisdom. - Really? What are those? - Very rare. Grandpa says they're a special plant and only live in the fallen forest. They can think like humans with knowledge and wisdom. Did he make it or not? Don't you have the results yet? Coming in now, sir. We have a signal. Let me see. Ah, so that's the jungle planet, is it? Interesting. I must say, the monkey seems very much at home there. We did it! Quiet. What are you celebrating for? I'm the one that made this happen. You just followed orders. Now you're dancing around? Get back to work. Yes, sir. You, get the transport ready. I'm going to the jungle planet myself. I can't wait to see our dear Dr. Sedgwick. But, sir, the vehicle isn't reliable. The circuit board still has some flaws. Then fix the thing. I want it fixed and ready to leave in 15 minutes. Yes, sir. We'll get right on it. Penny, keep an eye on them for me. Wow, brainy plants. Yeah. In fact, they were so smart, grandpa couldn't find them. - Hey, I've got an idea. - Ow. Our adventure will be to go find those plants. Ta-dah! What do you think about that? Come on, really, isn't that a great plan? - Whoa, easy. - Whoa, what's happening? Is your grandpa any good at driving this thing? As far as I know. Whoa! Argh! I never knew this lab was in the complex. You're sure this is where we'll find rainie? Shh, let's focus. Zero, eight, one, zero, two, eight. Careful, we don't know who sent you that message. I don't have time to worry about that. - Dr. Sedgwick is such a brilliant mind. - It opened. I agree completely. I've been following his work since I was a grad student. Me too. He's amazing. I don't know anyone else who could have discovered the dimensional portal and actually make it work. What was that? It's taken the doctor 12 years to figure out the portal's mechanics, and it still give him fits. And when he gets back from the jungle planet, he'll probably tinker with it for years to come. We'll have to put in lots more 15-hour days. But what's new? But wait, I forgot there's a plus to having those extra hours. We'll be making lots of overtime pay. Yes! And another thing... I'm so excited to try the doctor's new hot sauce on fried pork. I'm sure glad that chief's daughter is all right, or I wouldn't be able to look her in the eye the next time I see her. What do you mean? - What the...? - What have you done to my baby? We're ready for anything. Here comes the boss. Spread out, boys. He's about to land. I made it. Well, surprise, doc. That's it? Blue? Blue? I feel like a used basketball. We'd better move out. Don't want to get caught. Mm-hmm. Oh, boy. Why is the floor still shaking? That was great, way better than a rollercoaster. Blue, we should go and do this again. Are you crazy? Any more of this, and I'm toast. Mm, mm, mm. I think you need to work out. Mm, mm, mm. Don't make those noises. I'll be fine in just a minute. Hey, seeds of wisdom, where are you all hiding? Blue's risking intense dizziness to find you. So come out. You'll be in a lot of trouble if you don't. - That's not nice. - I can feel them. They're over this way. Maybe not. The vibes are much stronger over there. Grandpa once said the seeds like places with lots of water, so we should look around, see if there's a lake. - That makes sense. Let's do it. - Wait up. The water... it's hiding behind those trees. Stop messing around, smarty-pants. Let's go. We've been out here walking for hours, and so far we've seen nothing but rocks. Blue, are you sure we're going the right way? It's really close. I can smell it. Huh? Just over the Ridge. Looks like it might have moved. It's this way. So, any clues? I know you're here. I'm being distracted. I'm having trouble becoming one with the water. Blue! Is your nose working or not? Stop lying now. Where's the water? - Come on. - Whoa now. The fact is, we might be, nothing really serious, but a little bit lost. That's what I thought. I suspected it for a while. I mean, we kept passing the same rocks. I'll lead from now on. Oh! What are these things? Don't be scared, rainie. Give me your hand. What's going on? What are these? Who are you? Quit hiding. Come down. It's all right. I'm not gonna let them hurt you. Ho-ho! That's a human over there. Why would the little guy even talk to one? What is this? Why do you want to know? - We're friends, that's all. - Friends? That's odd. How can a human and a lumore be friends? It makes no sens. You look like you're related to them. This is weird. I feel connected, like I know these guys. But wait a minute. You just met them. - Sedora. - You don't even... What are you doing? Get rid of that thing. Gladly, kid. But first, do this. You've been kept in the dark. As lumores, we were born with the ability to summon plants. You'd know that if you hadn't been completely brainwashed. We can dirty up that brain and get you thinking straight again. Go ahead, tell him, honey. Blue, you are a lumore like us. Wait, how is it you know my name? The heritage of our ancestors flows within you. We've been searching for you for 12 years. It's time, blue. You must take your rightful place within the lumore clan. What are you doing? Once you awaken to your heritage, you will accept the power within you... The power I will now activate. I arouse within you the legacy of lumore. Attention, photo opportunity. Say cheese. Yahoo! Are you surprised? Didn't expect me so soon, did you? You gotta be kidding. Grab that monkey! Photo opportunity. Say cheese. Cheese. Cheese. Cheese. Huh? What in the...? - Stop that robot. - Sir. - Stop. - You proved you cheeseheads are good for something. Photo opportunity. Now we'll see what's going on. - Huh? - Oh. It's true... He's been using my money to make new hot sauce. Mm, very tangy, not bad at all. Go find and arrest our friend Dr. Hot sauce. Sir. Stupid lug. I'll be firing you as soon as we get back. Huh? Oh, wait a minute. He found it. I should have known. The old goat lied to me! Oh, good. The kid's waking up. Let's see what he's made of. - You're mulla. - We now welcome back... - And you're tulla. - ...This child member who had been lost to us for so many years. I don't understand. Why do I know both your names? This is wonderful. Your powers brought him back to us. And we're so far from the sacred tree. What sacred tree? What powers? What did you do? I don't understand. Oh, my head's gonna burst. The heritage of the lumore has awakened within your heart. And now, blue, rise. Try to focus energy to the palm of your hand. Great. I'm sure I can handle it from here. Now, blue, just focus and repeat after me. Zeevala! Huh. I just wanted to see if you were paying attention. Time for the real demonstration. Now observe. Zeevala! Zeevala! Zeevala! Zeevala! Huh? You see? It worked. A mighty tree. Impressed? I have the power. Of course that level of sorcery requires lots of practice. Might take you years before you're... Huh? Ah, a prodigy. I think we can suspend class for the rest of the day. Blue, you all right? You don't have to accept this. But I'm not like you, not at all. You're a different race. All the things I know are lies. Are things that bad? At least you have someone who loves you, not like me. You're lucky. Really, I envy you. A grandpa like yours... That would be wonderful. Ignore these two. Come on, let's split. You can't just walk away. Blue, remember you're part of us. You're a lumore. Come on, you don't believe that. Hey, lumores don't ever lie. Let's not forget, we still have to find the seeds of wisdom for grandpa. Let's go. Excuse me? You're looking for what? We are the seeds of wisdom. Are you working for that old creep? Old creep? I warned you 12 years ago when he stole the sprout. 12 years ago? Grandpa did this? How could he? Come on, you call that greedy human grandpa? - Dice me up for salad. - Mulla. Don't listen to him. Grandpa's not like that. I don't know what to think. Why do you think of him as your grandfather? You're not related to him in any way. You barely relate to us. Gosh, I feel so lost right now. Why is this happening? Tell me. Blue, come and rejoin our tribe. You belong with others of your kind. Don't fall for that. Why don't we go hear grandpa's side of the story? Stop it. I don't want to hear from anybody. - Argh! - Wait, blue. Are we too late? He thinks he's a kid, not a sapling. Blue. There you are. Blue. Um... Is it okay if I talk to you? ♪ We start shaking ♪ Come on, I know you're upset, but I just don't believe grandpa thinks of you as an experiment. You're his little boy. ♪ Don't hold back ♪ ♪ what you're thinking... ♪ You could at least go talk to him. What harm could that do? What would be the point? He's a human. How can he be my grandfather? He can't. That means he's been lying. I can't believe it. I'm so stupid. So that's pretty much what happened. But you don't have to worry. He was very clear... She'll be back in three short days. Here, sit down. You all right? Everything's under control, okay? I put it in the text. I should have gone to her when she called me. She was reaching out. This whole thing is my fault. I forgot her birthday. I'm a terrible mother. Oh, come on, please don't cry. - Send me to that place. - What? Send me there. I'm gonna find my daughter. I'm gonna bring her back. Please, please, there's a lot involved. We'd have to ask the boss first. Don't forget, Dr. Sedgwick is sending her back in three days. Stop it. I'm bringing her back. And you're sending me over right now. Well... We really should involve the boss. Chief, we get it. And we're concerned about this as well. But there are rules and we have to follow them. We'll ask the boss. And after that, we'll bring her right back. I hope we gave the kid enough ammo to fight the old man. In the end, he is one of us after all. So if his heritage kicks in, he'll give him the old one-two. Hmm, yeah. But what if he wimps out? He might need us to come and help. You know what? We should check on the boy. Oh, yeah. I mean, what could it hurt? He might need to be protected. What if they...? That human's a smooth talker, I'm sure. He could probably talk the rough edges right off this rock. Ouch. That poor kid could be fooled by him again. Oh, no. What a terrible fate he could suffer. You have to slow down, dear. Come on. Okay, but I'm worried. He was raised by that human. His brain could have been damaged. Aha! I have finally found it. Oh, my back. Well, you're not gonna get away this time. He now knows the only family he has is us. Hmm, hope so. But they might try to convince him his skin turned blue from too much sun. - Watch out! - Mulla! So the same old trick? But you shoot like a man wearing a blindfold. Ooh, see what I mean? Mulla, be careful. He's coming around. Let's get out of here. I'm telling you, he can't see past the end of his nose. Okay, but don't get cocky. I hope he's aiming at rocks and plants, 'cause that's all he's hitting. - Ha. - You all right? Oh, yeah. He's way behind this race. We don't know what he's got in the way of weapons. - Just watch yourself. - Ha-ha! This ammo looks strange. Why shoot these projectiles? He's up to something. Hold on. I can feel danger nearby. Mulla, drop that thing right now. Mulla, say something, will you? Mulla! Don't worry, you'll be all right. Zeevala! You're an evil guy. Keep your distance! Don't you dare come any closer. I'm warning you. Sorry, my dear. So you won't talk? If you won't, I will. Hey, my knife. Why did you do that? Have you lost your mind? Why in the world do you still need a knife? Don't you just use magic now? You are a mess! Argh! You're not even listening. You know what? I'm done. Do whatever you want. Keep this. I don't understand yo. You've been with grandpa your whole life and you have no faith in him. You're not gonna solve the problem by hiding out like this. I wish I could switch your grandpa for my mom. The one smart thing she used to say was, running from a problem isn't going to solve it, no matter how fast you run. So let's go back to the tretree househouse and figure this out together. What do you say? All right. Is your mom really that bad to you? Much worse than your grandpa. What happened here? Happened? Look at this. Goodness. Look. I think she's unconscious. Tulla! Tulla, are you okay? Grandpa made this. Tulla, tulla, talk to me, please. I'm not hearing her heart. Please wake up. Come on, tulla. Can you breathe for me? Come on now. Come on. That c.P.R. Course in school... What did they say? You're awake. Thank heavens. What happened to you? Take your hands off me, human! - Argh! Leave me alone. - Tulla, no! - Blue. - Rainie, you okay? Yeah, thanks to you. Stop helping her. You're a traitor to your race. Her kind came here and took mulla away. Now move. The girl has to pay. You want to save your friend, then let's go. Come with us. We'll get him back. Tulla, listen to her. We can still save him, but you have to trust us. It's the only way this can work. All right, I'll take a chance, just this once though. Let's go see that old creep. Hmm, now let's see. Where is my good friend Dr. Sedgwick? Aha! There he is. Well, doctor, it's time to settle up on your promises over the years. No more excuses. Bring the old guy here at once. Yes, sir. We're on it. Oh, these old bones of mine aren't used to this kind of exercise. Don't worry, my friend. It won't take long. Let me just prepare the experiment. I think I'm ready. Nothing can be allowed to go wrong. Argh! Who are you? Long time, no see. Right, Dr. Hot sauce? My bad. I messed that up. Of course I meant "Sedgwick." What? You opened the portal? Didn't think that was possible. Isn't it nicer to talk in person, huh? Much easier to be understood, you have to admit. We've spent so much money on you over the years, and yet your lab looks so shabby. Well, I promise you, by the time we've improved it, this lab will be state of the art. You'll love it. Please take your troops and get out of here. I'll send you the d.N.A. You want us to go? For what reason? So you can keep up this fraud? Well, I wasn't able to capture a donor until... Just stop the charade. You think I'm brain-dead? Well, I'm not. You found your sample donor a long time ago. It was when I first arrived. I rescued this poor wounded seed of wisdom. They call themselves lumores. The first serum I developed was based on the research I did on him. Calm down. The fact is, you were duty-bound to tell me all this, Dr. I'm-gonna-keep-a-secret. In case you've forgotten, I am your boss. I know. At first he was just a testing object. But he grew so fast every day. He was so cute, so kind. The first word he learned to speak was "grandpa." He'd wake up each day with a smile on his face. Well, I no longer saw the lad as an experiment. After a while, we got so close, he was like a real grandson. How poignant. Your behavior makes sense. I won't allow anyone to hurt the kid, especially not me. Grandpa. Why are you so convinced we're gonna hurt him? It's all just research and nothing more. And anyway, you appear to have something new for me. Who might this specimen be, hmm? He's a new testing object. Where is my grandson? Mulla! - I have to help grandpa. - Wait. I was hoping we could come up with a plan, but... Release mulla! I won't let you... Tulla, are you all right? Great. The lumores are now just dropping in. You spent 12 years raising one, and now there are three available for your work. You should really be... Enough! Tell your men to put down their guns. Okay, okay, you get to be the boss. Blue. Oh, it's all grandpa's fault. I shouldn't have lied. It was wrong of me. But mostly, it was wrong to have kept you so long with me, very wrong. And I'll understand if you hate me. Grandpa. You're willing to overlook what I've done? No matter what, you're still my grandad. That's great. Please. Not that this isn't moving. However, we're not here for a family reunion. You have an experiment waiting. Right. I'll begin the experiment. When it's done, take the results and get out. I don't want to see your face anymore after this. I'm fine with that. Once I get what I want, I'll go. Just give me that d.N.A. After I have that, it will make everything right. They might elect me chairman of the board. Grandpa, don't hurt mulla. Don't worry. The procedure won't take too long. He won't feel a thing. Busy signal. But don't worry, chief. - I can connect right to the lab. - Then do it. Okay. The light... it just went on. - Does that mean we're good? - Couldn't be that fast. D.n.a. Extraction should take twice as long. Very strange. Well, was it successful? There's your daughter. Said she's okay. Who are they? Why do they have weapons? I've never seen them before. - Sweetheart, sweetheart. - Hey, boss. - It's mom. Can you hear me? - Are you able to hear me? - Boss. - Rainie. That's it? Give me a break. You're done? So fast? I've been waiting 12 years, you're done in 30 minutes? You wasted 12 years of my life, mister. Give me that tube right now. I paid for that. First let them go. Mulla. Blue, you have to get out of here. I'll catch up with you once I get rid of these men. No way. Forget it. We're not leaving you here. I don't trust them. They won't keep their promises. Oh, yes, they will. I'll see to that. Rainie, take blue and get out of here. What about you? Don't mind me. Take him and leave. Blue, let's go. No, I don't want to do it, okay? Don't worry about me, my boy. I'll be just fine. You go. Come on. Are you ready to hand it over? I'll give it when you and your soldiers are ready to leave. You'll find the rule of nature is stronger than your ambition. I thought it was the answer, but you can't harness conscious plants. Enough. These plants are destined to save the earth. I know I'm right. I wouldn't spend all this for nothing. It's very clear you're committed, but I have finally come to realize that we've been wrong for these last 12 years. You may be wrong, but I'm not. I've never been wrong in my life. Oh, let me go. What do you think you're doing? Easy, doctor. Just making sure you don't accidentally drop the tube. Give it back to me. We'll keep it safe. I'm going to be very influential. - Give that back to me. - Keep an eye on him. - The rest of you, come. - You monster. I have an assignment for you. We're going to round up our specimens. What are you pulling? You said you'd let them go. Come back here. Come back. This is not happening. They're arresting Dr. Sedgwick. I have to get there, no matter what's involved. Gotta save my daughter. I'm coming. Never knew the boss was such a monster. Thank you for offering, but I'm her mother and I have to do this myself. It's my responsibility. Hey, you two, if you're done discussing this, which one is going? Me, of course. There's something you should take with you. It's an ultramolecular freezing gun. It can instantly immobilize its target, no matter what the difference. There's only one little drawback, and that is... You only have one shot, so you have to aim carefully. I invented this bad boy. Uh, chief, one more thing... A de-boosting chip. It's the only way to stop the boss's big machine. - Gotta move it. I don't trust that guy. - Where are we going? Some place where we can hide and wait for grandpa to come. Right. Let me think of a place. He sent his soldiers after us, and they're catching up. You'd better think fast. That little one must have been on the track team at school. We've got to take cover. Mulla, that's great... You're awake. Were we wrestling? Not everything's quite clear yet. Oh, hi. Wait a minute. It's coming back to me now. We made a clean getaway, right? What's your definition of "clean"? Zeevala! My dear, your form is just as effective as ever. Good work. Wow, she's great. She's turned the plants against us. Well, let's see how they do against this guy. That's the most horrible creature I've ever seen. The machine's ugly as well. Why are we standing around? Let's run for it. You might as well give up now. You won't outrun me. Of course, you're welcome to try. - This human's willing to destroy his own kind. - He's gaining! Oh, splitting up, are you? Don't you have some place to be, like an appointment with the scrap heap? We've got to figure a way out, or we're gonna be toast. I've got it. Remember the stone forest over by the cliffs? - Yeah. - We need to draw him there. - It's too dangerous. - Shh. What if I screw up? What happens then? Have some confidence. You'll do fine. Use your powers. Whoo-hoo! Rainie, wait. Goodbye. Interesting... First time I saw a flower with a tongue. Hey, shorty! You and me, one on one! I'm gonna squash you like a bug. How's that gonna happen? You're no bigger than a bug. I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee! I dare ya. To do which... float or sting? I'll show you I can do both! We'd better help. Diss me? You're a shrimp yourself. I've got company, have I? Huh? I guess you need some training - on how to sneak around. - Blue! Ha-ha! Time for some bug-squashing. - Go for it, blue! - Ready? - Good work. - Zeevala! What's going on? Yay! We pulled it off! - We are definitely the best. - It was my idea, but you made it happen. We make a good team, you know? All right! Those were some very excellent moves. You're definitely a lumore. I knew you were gonna be good at this sort of thing. I could just feel it. And you as well, little girl. I'm not really a little girl. You're not all that tall yet. Where are you going? I left my dagger on that machine. I have to get it back. Hey, we could make you an honorary lumore. - Blue! - Don't wear my name out. Watch out behind you! You little brats have the nerve to resist? You'll be sorry you ever raised a hand against me. Oh, dear. Grandpa! You believe your SWAT team can hold me? Well, surprise. Blue, I'll protect you. All right! Try to harm my grandson, will you? Kids, get on board. All the little pests, together in one trap. Hang on, blue. Grandpa, blue's not on yet. Blue! Lumores don't allow any harm to come to their clan. I'm fine. Go ahead and close the door. Blue. Rainie, don't worry. He's safe. His friends will watch over him. Ha-ha! You old goat, you can never defeat me. Wave the white flag. He's way too strong. We're in trouble. You pests are becoming an irritation. I guess it's time to exterminate you. - Shield! - Shield! Blue! You freak, you'll destroy everything. You've gone mad. You're wrong, old man. I'm gonna save humanity. Hmm? And you, my friend, are on the wrong side of history. Grandpa. Hurry, he's gonna shoot. He's insane. Mama, I wish I could see you once more. Ha-ha! What... what's happening? Rainie! Mama's here, sweetheart. - And I won't let him hurt you. - Mama. I'm your boss. Back off. Mama, get away from there. Watch out! Your mom has got a de-boosting chip. She can power off his machine. Chief, don't do it. Your job's on the line! Mama, the ice is cracking. There's the port. Help her. I'm coming! That's it. I'm gonna take out every one of you. Huh? - Get off me, banana breath. - Mama! Are you okay? Rainie, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. That's a promise. I'll remember your birthdays, no matter what. Sweetheart, I do love you. Believe me, I know I haven't been a very good mother. Please forgive me if you can. I was working so hard because I wanted to make life better for both of us. But I should have been there for you. I know you love me. I'm sorry I ran away. The important thing is, we're back together. I won't let anyone hurt you. There it is. - I'll do it. - Don't. It's too dangerous. That machine has defenses that can hurt you. Why am I flying? We're giving you the power, rainie, but you have to hurry. Gotcha. Nobody messes with my mom. Oh, please, you people are the ones who have been messing with me. Well, that all ends now. I'm gonna wring your monkey neck. You are through! Don't you touch my little girl, you hear me? Don't worry. She's fine. The power of lumore will protect her. - Tell her. Am I right, poopsie? - Mm-hmm. You're gonna be monkey bread. What are you doing? Oh, no. Oh, how about that? We're a lot more powerful than we thought. What have you done to my attack mecha? I'm losing control! Rainie, get off that thing. The cliff's shattering. No way. Please save my daughter before she falls off that cliff. Don't worry, rainie. We'll be there to catch you. Ready, tulla? Ha! Yeah! - All right! Yeah! Amazing! - You did it, rainie! - Good work, girl! - We're proud of you, sweetheart. The knife... I forgot it. Let it go! No! - Whoa. - Rainie! Let go. I have to save my daughter. You can't. The cliff isn't stable. Oh, no. Rainie, where are you? Mama. You're alive? You mean, you're all right? - Rainie. - I'm fine. I got the knife just in time. Come on, baby, give me your hand. You showed him. Good work. Careful now. Just grab hold and I'll pull you up. A little bit further. You can do it. You're my brave little girl. Hey, I'm 12 already. That's right. Yesterday was your birthday. And we need to celebrate all your birthdays for the rest of your life. I won't forget again, ever. Hey, look. Wait a minute. Of course! I should have seen this before. The d.N.A. Is tied to this planet and can't survive on earth. I need to cross-fertilize a stronger hybrid. The answer was staring me right in the face. There's no time to waste. I have to get started, chop-chop. I don't understand a word he's carrying on about. Oh, well. Blue, keep this. I might not be around to return it if you lose it again. You keep it. After all, you earned it. This was your first grown-up gift from grandpa. No way I'm taking it. Think of it as a late gift from me. Well... Thank you, blue. I'll take good care of it. Do you figure we'll see each other someday? It's possible, but... Gosh, blue, I'll never forget you, ever. - Don't forget me either. - I won't, really, never, not in a million years. Maybe they'll let us come visit. That'd be great. Until then, best friends? Yeah, you and I will be... Best friends forever. Say cheese. Tell me, what is that? Some ritual, hmm? Hello there. I want to talk to my mom. - Is someone hiding in there? - Mama, blue told me... - I see you. - ...He just graduated, and he's 12 too. - Careful, dear, I'm very delicate. - So when do I graduate?
