The Crossing Winter 1776, barely six months from the proclamation American independence. The US Army has been decimated. The British have run it over in Manhattan. German mercenaries Hessen They killed them hundreds. They were hardly any threat British Empire. Before the winter they were in a cold, Tired and sick. And the British got them still further south, according to the natural boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Say Delaware. Move that cannon. Try it. Help! Damn it, hold on! Let's go! Ready? One two Three! Dignier! One two Three! Dignier! Mr. Hamilton? -Generale, why Are you here? The British are everywhere. Damn and a top! Block We're going further. - I understand. Let's go, gentlemen. Put a blockage. Do not forget the horses. December 7, 1776 The coast to New Jersey We have five hundred sick people. We'll put them here? - No, we'll cross the river. When? They will die if they are lying in the cold. We will all die, if we do not cross the river. Header! To Glaveru, I would cross the river. What, sir? Let's swim? To Glaveru, I would cross the river. How, sir? We have 2000 people. Where are our ships? The upstream is a factory. Great the boat is transporting ore to Philadelphia. Get people, get out there and get our boats. What can I pay for? Damn it, Chief, open your eyes! We are cluttered, If we do not cross the river, we're done. Get those ships. Get them if necessary. In the meantime, take care of the sick. I understand. Are you Robert McKenzie? You own this factory? Who are you? I have the authority of the US military. Temporarily for you military we are seizing boats. -What? God, is that your revolution? That equality and freedom? You're ruining a man's job! You're wasting your property? - I'm listening to orders. - Whose orders? General Washington. - Then God punish this bandit! What will I live with? Who will pay me? -Kongres. And you will have our lifelong Thanks for your help. You and your Congress! All of you will hang! You too! You will all have the consequences! You do not have a look! Surrender yourself! Glider, move that boat. Here! - The boat is moving, Mr. Hamilton! Let's go, gentlemen! Mr. Hamilton, faster! Gentlemen. I'll be open. Six months ago our army was in New York. We had 20 thousand people and 300 pieces of artillery. How many are they ready today? - Less than two thousand. Henry, how many pieces do we have? artillery? -Imainest, sir. Less than two thousand people, 18 cannons. And we would fight against the most powerful country in the world. He constantly beat us and beat us. He takes us and tramples us and punishes us. I have to write Congress about our condition. Gentlemen, what can I tell them? Say we're on the west coast. And the British are on the east. And there is no proper boat which is not in your hands. We have the advantage of several days or Sunday, until the river is freezing. And when 20,000 Britons crossed over? - Then we'll retire again. And open them to Philadelphia. What's left? - We are. We do not have food, medicine or blankets. I'm more a doctor than a general. We have a jaundice and a dysentery. So, in what condition are we? You are right, General Merser, The army can not stock it. I suggest we endure it. That's why we will find what we need. What is the alternative, gentlemen? To lay down a weapon? Let's give it up an enemy to grace? No. While I command, we will try our best. Get together. We are here. We got out of New York here. This way I shared. General Leo 2000 people and this direction. General Gates 1200 people and this direction. If they stop an army, the other two will not. We meet here. And where are they? How two armies can I just disappear? Stirling, you're in charge for New Jersey. Find them. - I understand. Keep working, gentlemen. - I understand. Perhaps Lee just sits and waits that you and your army are gone. I do not want to believe that. - He is and Gates hates you. - Yes, William. I will not leave until I say everything openly. Li wants your place. It's the easiest to let you lose him. I'm just asking you to find him. - And what if she tells me I'm losing? Sullivan is his deputy. There may be problems with Lee. You and Salivan will arrest him, and bring his men to me. You are general Washington? -I did. I'm Thomas Barclay. That stone house is mine. I've come to offer it to you for the headquarters and refuge from the cold. You can not fight like animals in the wild. -Thank you from your heart. Let your officers join us at dinner. - He'll be honored. Here you go. Find General Lee and his people. More tonight. Otherwise, we're done. People are wearing summer uniforms, and many are barefoot. Although permanent requests are tiring, Please congress for understanding. Today is December 20th. Mobilization takes place within 11 days and half the guys will go home. I have nothing to pay for them, and I do not have food or clothes. I do not know how to go without money and please help us. Come on, Alex. I'm tired, I'll rest. - I understand. Yes? - He is. It's open. Then, Hugh? An intelligence messenger came data. -What are the data? What is? -Do you want to read this? It's from Van Hagen. Van Hagen? A Dutch merchant who hates British. What does he tell us now? General Hau sucks some lady Loring. Every night they are together. His eyes are glassy and completely general as a 15-year-old. I'm so glad, Hugh, But why is it important? Looks like Mrs. Loring responsible for our survival. He would have been with 20 thousand people here on the river. He thinks we're done. It's already Cornwall sent to England. -Budala. Kornvolas is his only commander who is not an idiot. They are waiting for the river to freeze. Colonel Ral is with 1,200 Hezeknes occupied Trenton. They are careful not to go to Boston. -1200 Guyana? For God's sake, he despises us! - For the reason, sir. For a reason? - We do not even have a thousand boys, no food, no clothes. The Hessenians are the best soldiers in the world. Our fears are like Salem pastor when he saw the witch. Hessens. -Van Hagen writes to Hau expected to surrender in two weeks. And he will be generous. - Large? I'll go to hell before than to surrender to Hau. Come on, Hugh. Where? - Let's go look at Trenton. I've never seen this place. Now, sir? - Yeah, Hugh, now. It's not a river. - Less than a Descendant. To have courage, they would make an abortion and cross it. They do not have to. They can wait. 1200 Guyana. - And the elite regiment who rocked us at Brooklyn. Killers of your Virginia people. - Listen. What do you hear? We were scared we were alone Down here. Go. - Quiet. These are ours, Hugh. - Some drinks. - You're wrong. General Salivan. General Stirling. -Generale Washington. Where is General Lee? - The British have it. How did this happen? We walked in, he left in a tavern 3.5 kilometers away. He was captured there or joined them. - I got it. What kind of people are you in the state of affairs? -872 walking, the rest on the stretcher. And what do you know about General Gates? He'll be here till night. - Good. It's five o'clock now. Send people to our camp, if they can walk. - I can do it. Go with them, Hugh. We'll meet you. - You will not be with us? -No. There. This is all. Do you want my opinion? Open and honest. - I think you're out of your mind. You're open, Colonel Glaver, but it does not matter now. The question is can you do that? I can not. But I'll do it. What does that mean to you? -It means that this whole idea is crazy. But if you decide to go In hell, my fishermen will be with you. When everything is gathered, alternatives and no, right? -I think no. Then it will be. Header? - You go? Thank you. -Thanks when everything is over. Let's not talk about defeat anymore. Our side will triumph. And General Noks will then write a book about it. I'm selling books, ma'am. I would not know how to write it. Maybe General Header could. - Lieutenant. It's too generous. I am not a writer, I am a fisherman. Be sure, ma'am, it will not fail to tell you. I noticed that your uniform was yours different. -That's not uniform. It's my clothes. And this is it my hair, as God has given me. Because of this gentleman I will not be despised according to anglican church. We share it what we are fighting for. But I will not wear silk and lace nor be a fool with a wig. I'm a fisherman and a baptist, ma'am. So I was born, so I will die. I will not apologize, just explain the speech of Colonel Glaver was open. He never shifts. He does not strive for beauty. - Not really, ma'am. I am the debtor. God, I've experienced an apology John Header. - I did not apologize. I thanked the lady for lunch and wine, Unlike all of you. General Gates arrived with the soldiers. Bad will, in the room. Bring him, Alex. - I understand. Presbyterian, Mr. Noks. -G. Barkley, we are constantly bothering you. How that? - General Gates just arrived. I'll meet you. My colleague, General Gates. Welcome. Did you eat? -I did. Can we use it tonight? this room? - Sure. Sit down, General. Drink wine. Stay, sit down, gentlemen. It's too late, but maybe not too late. We had already held a meeting, but I wanted to come and General Gates. I'm still from the Congress yesterday got this note. Supreme Commander, General Washington. Congress moves to Baltimore because Philadelphia can not be defended. We leave you your salted hands in deciding on further struggle. There, gentlemen. Six months ago, on July 4, we became a state. We held the three largest cities, Boston, New York and Philadelphia. We lost New York since then. Because of the impossibility of the Congress he withdrew from Philadelphia. We lost all the battles, we only got a handful of soldiers. The British have written off. They're just imagining the conditions of our surrender. They're waiting for Delaware to freeze and then they will hand over those conditions to us. You have clearly described the situation. - Good. Keep your mind, Gentlemen, now listen to me. Over the river, 16 kilometers downtown is Trenton. It's kept by 1200 of the Hensens under Ral's command. They have food, warm clothes, tents, weapons, ammunition. In short, everything we need. In four days, Christmas, The Hesenites will celebrate and drink day and night. I want to 25th in the evening we cross the river and enter Trenton. Hessence will attack before dawn. If God is with us, We'll capture them all. I waited for you to come, to suggest this to you. What do you say? You better not know. So, you have remarks? -Many. -Do you specify? -Rado. First, you need an army to attack. You do not have an army. Secondly, you need soldiers for the attack. Your guys are not soldiers. Thirdly, your strengths go only in one direction. The attack is the opposite. Continue? - Of course. Mobilization expires in 11 days. Why should the boys attack then? They better sit quietly and go home. It is impossible to cross the river, and that the Hessens do not find out. Spies are everywhere. The transition will take hours. Their cannons will welcome you long before you cross. Your boats are a great target. Nor would the Norther miss them. And finally, you will not defeat Hessence. These are European soldiers. The most disciplined, best dressed, and you know that well. Their supremacy ... - There will be a drawback. - Please, sir. They're not dressed for such an attack. We'll kick them out of bed, they will not get organized. I'm afraid for your common sense, you are no longer a commander. How dare you? - No, how dare you? I already have enough of your intentions. And I'm sick of a false military skill you and your company. You are not soldiers. And you are a bad commander. You're afraid it is defeated, and you want destruction. Have you finished? - Let's face it, the revolution is over. So, we'll surrender. Take off We are all and reason has prevailed. But I'm unreasonable, except what I'm a bad soldier. You're right. My guys are not soldiers. They have 16, 17, 18 years. Beige. Guyana is afraid of death. It's all true. But they believe in me. They could desert, Thousands are, but these guys are not. They stay with me. Generale, I command the army, not you. And if I bring them to hell, they will be in hell after me! So listen to me well. You will leave the camp, not with anyone you will not talk about this. Blow the pistol at him, Alex, Get him off, let him go. If he wants to take soldiers, Kill him. - You would not dare. Check out, General Gates. Go with him, Alex, but quickly come back. We have a lot of work. This is not fun, gentlemen. - Of course not. Gates is right. If the Hesenas find out about this, We'll all go to hell. Right. Now listen to me well. We have only one day to prepare something we have not yet tried. Sorry, but we have fought. - We were defeated and defeated. At Christmas we attack for the first time. I will not drive your cannon while mine People do not cross. - You're stubborn. We need guns for the attack. - I will not fight the dealers. Get out of the rain, Mr. Noks. For transportation of cannons and horses we'll put a platform on two boats. We'll build boats thick wooden wedges. Twenty of my fishermen holders on each platform. - What do you want? We need five boats for the transport of people. What then? We'll waste time on dismantling platform, and people will wait? Think a bit, Mr. Noks. -Glaveru, You are a barbaric barber. - That's it. It's a civilized guy. It's shining on this cold. We'll cross near McConkey's scaffolding. Then we'll split in two columns and at night enter Trenton. You have two days to determine who what will. Tell people how much less. Tell them to run when we prepare the passage, not before. Any questions? -My people They need guns. - How much? Maybe hundreds. - You'll get ten. The rest of the muskets and bayonets. General, they're shooters. They will not land on muskets. They will not agree to Hesen they kill. Look around, Captain. Better and musket than a rifle that Do not shoot. That night we all go together. Yes, captain Hajnaman? My guys are good and brave Germans from Pennsylvania. But for them, the Hesenas are the devil themselves. Devil. If I tell them the last time for Hessence, he'll be nervous. If I tell them today, we can talk. It's better for everyone this way. What do you think? - He's telling them. No danger. Nobody understands them anyway. What are you smoking? - Dried cow balloon. What's the taste? - Like a shit. Is that yours? - Corn. Remember tobacco? - Yes. You made a terrible mess. Why all this? I hope so prevent water penetration. I do not want to fight with a damp drum. You will not succeed. McConny? General, it's a great honor. Let's go somewhere else. - Let's stay, this is confidential. How you want. But please, sit down. I always imagined you were coming and look for a bottle of Madera. McConnell, there is no Madera from here to Philadelphia. Thank you. I did not try this like this for a year. - It's yours. - Drink with me. -No no. No drops. This is just yours. So, what you wanted to talk? I hear you do not like our enemies. - I'd kill them all! And do you know that you're silent? - Like a dead man. - Good. Tomorrow I need this house, all day. This will be my headquarters. I'll cross the river with two thousand people and attack. Bastards in Trenton? - Yes, the bastards in Trenton. General, can I, however, to drink a little? When you arrived, you did not notice Ice on the river? - They do not mind us. Not now, but Delaware a strange and tumultuous river. The frost came and covered everything to the valley in the north. It will freeze for a day or two, and then it will be worse. We're crossing tomorrow. - For God's sake, General! Excuse me for the audacity, But why do not you wait for the spring? I believe in the same thing, I love That army. - And me, more than anything. Why do not you wait? - If we do not move Tomorrow there will be no more troops. Yes? It's Christmas, sir. Happy to you, Christmas. Thank you. Always shave with cold water? - I have to get used to it. It's true. If we go. We're crossing, Chief. Tonight. May I ask something? - Would you Did not you say no? -I would not. Then, of course, to Gloucester. Say it. - Would you attack Hessence in the afternoon? A stupid question, I do not intend to. But would you? - Talk, openly. - Good. Let's say the boats Prepare until 17.30. It's already night. We're left six and a half hours to cross. Mash at midnight. People will be Cold, it will be wet and tired. With three kilometers per hour, We arrive in Trenton before dawn. We'll go five an hour. - Maybe, I'm not saying that you will not even want to. But such an army can not to get ice for 6 or 10 hours. So you'll be in Trenton for a day. If we even cross the damn river. What did you say last time? -Please? - If we go anyway. Header? -Yes? Since I've known you, You're bothering me and torturing me. You'd be a general not to torture and all the others. - I do not care about that. We need more soldiers, not generals. - The truth. You're a hard man. But you saved us to Brooklyn, on the Frogs to the North and the North. You are brave of anyone I know. And you're a great soldier. So this is the command, if you will not to return people to Massachusetts. Or where did you come from? So, execute the command. Transfer me an army across the river, and this night. I understand, General, I'll transport you army across the river. So, God, I do not know how, but I will do it. I'm not going to Trenton until all boats pass. I want your fishermen to be with me. -I will. Are you ready? - Yes, and you? -I did. Gentlemen, you know the whole plan. I will repeat the main elements. It's now 17.10. We start embarking for exactly twenty minutes. When we cross, we march south and we split into two wings. Green and I are commanding the first and we're going to Penington. General Salivan leads the other wing and it goes by the River. Akobogda, we will enter Trenton at six o'clock in the morning. It will still be dark. You wanted something, Colonel Glaver? - Yes, sir. Gentlemen, on boarding and landing I'm looking for discipline and speed. There is no interference in the work of my people, One will be in each boat. What they say is a law, for a soldier or general of Washington. He will be the chief. By commanding, I command. Sir, confirm that. You heard the colonel. He orders loading and unloading. His orders Everyone has to listen. Any questions? Good. I wish you all the help of God, a lot of luck and a happy Christmas. -Also. Faster! Another one here. Three here. Easy. Look out, son. -Thank you. -Polako. Go! General. - Hugh, go over and close the other side. When we disembark, expand the circle. What time is it, Alex? 18.10. -Presses are. Get me Glaver. Go! Gentlemen, the soldiers are cold, You must be with them, not with fire! General. - Can you speed them up? -I can not. We have places for only two boats simultaneously. I told you ... Good. Get back to work. Come back. It's alive. Cheers! Captain, send me people. Do not stop embarking. Let's go, easy, guys. Faster! Alex, what time is it? -Around 22.00, sir. General. I'll get over. On the other side is a thousand guys. Come on, Nathaniel. You stay here? - No, I'm going to get mad From watching, I'm going to go over. I would have gone too far. - Why do not you wait for guns? If I mention the cannons again, Glaver will go crazy. Hates me. I was about it with him to talk, but ... He insulted me. - How? He said the army She did not eat for three months. And that betrayal is when someone is fat. Oh really? Come on, Henry, this is not night for lunch. In the boats. - I understand. Go with General Green and Noks. I'll be right back. I'll command from the shore. Wait until the last boat. Regardless of time and everything else, Everyone has to cross. We'll cross and march to Trenton. There is no debate about it. We are crossing and attacking. - I understand. Okay, I'll see you on the other side. They are, your head, start them. -Without worry, we'll all go. Move your fat ass, Henry. What did he say? -My fat ass. Do not move because you will sink the boat. Go! Easy, guys. Save power. You'll need it before dawn. God, they're so slow. Can we speed them up? We cross once, they all night. And there's still a march on Trenton. Easy, guys. All together. Abe, give me a rhythm! Align the boat. Closer! How's it going, Hugh? - Better, since does not fall snow. The guys are sleeping. - Okay. They will need their strength. 23.10. - It's clear now. The army will not cross three o'clock in the morning. Which means we will not reach Trenton before dawn. You must agree. I agree. - Then what? - We'll be missing in a day. How is the outer edge standing? There are three hundred on the edge. We picked up about ten people from the farms. Curious. I think they are innocent. - I'll talk to them. A friend, we know each other well. We've done a lot together. But how are we going to Trenton in the afternoon, and Hessen we expect? You know that would be the end. -Hugh. They set me up for the supreme the commander of the great army. And now I command to those who are left. I missed everything, All the attempts have failed me. These are not empty words. If necessary, I'll sneak into Trenton myself. Places, gentlemen. I'm General Washington. - Why did you capture us? Please, listen to me. Listen to me! For which hour we begin march south to Trenton. If he finds out about it, Hundreds of my people will be gone. You'll be in custody for three hours from the beginning of the march.

They will not come. - Tell him he must! If something can be understood, that is then defeat. The enemy is dying. Tell him that. General Washington, Colonel Ral dies. General Merser says it's a war Usually talk to you. Usual? Not in the war of customs, Nathaniel. I will not bow to the mercenary who killed me 500 people. He gave them a gift when they wanted to they surrender. Shove them back with bayonets! Should I cry for bastards, for people who kill for profit? Basically, we are fighting against British taxes. In the end, we all kill to earn money. Both the British, and the Hessens and us. Then good. Let's not turn out the savages. It's very weak. It will not be long.

But people are exhausted, sleeping on the road, in the meadows. Their heads are falling. - And I'm exhausted, gentlemen. Listen to me. This is our first victory in 12 months. We attacked for the first time. It happened miracle, the grace of God. Or we survived the craziness of the war. What do you think? If we had a war? Gentlemen, the war has just begun. We have two thousand people. The enemy has twenty thousand. I will not even eat or sleep until the river divides us. Go to your people and prepare them for march. Hugh. How many people have we lost? -None. And how many wounded? None. God! Do you know how I felt the last one 24 hours? - I can fix it. Like a lunatic. Who sends these wonderful guys to death.
