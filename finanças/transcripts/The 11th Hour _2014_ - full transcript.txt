Hello in there. Keep kicking, that's good. Peter. Peter, the baby is kicking. Really? Where? Here. Feel. You should also talk to it. Oh, yeah, sure. We have to. If you don't... If you don't say it, if you don't hear it, then you don't feel it exist. Baby, you're crazy. I love you. You know, Peter, it's more than that. When I look at you... I feel you in me. It's... It's... It's so far beyond love. Or saying I love you. Mommy. Mommy. I'm cold, Mommy. Mom, you really tried. Peter. Peter. Are you okay? Darling, are you okay? Maria. Look at me. Look at me, stay with me. Maria, please. Sweetheart, look at me. Don't go, don't go. Don't go, stay with me. Sweetheart, look at me. Look at me, don't go. You're gonna be fine, okay? You're gonna be fine, okay? Sweetheart, look at me, baby. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me! Baby, look at me! Oh, okay, do you know... Is it likely that's gonna happen again? It's not a question of happening again, the problem is... It means I can't have children, right? Right? The uterus is scarred and damaged, and that experimental operation won't break down scar tissue. In my opinion, it would be irresponsible to keep trying. And that's it? I can easily understand your frustration, but considering to your age and that you have had eight miscarriages within the last couple of years, and now sadly one in your 18th week... I trusted you. Maria, you were dead for 2 minutes. You have to understand, your uterus is destroyed. There is no chance of you getting pregnant again. There has to be another possibility. Listen. There has to be. I am sincerely sorry. Really. But your inability to have children is not unnatural. You're driving me crazy. We could apply at the fertility clinic in Madison. No. Maria, could you please stop? I just don't see how we can trust one doctor's opinion. I'm off to my meeting in Paris. I'm sorry. Are you? Yes, I am. What? Darling, this was the last time. We will not have kids. Okay? It's just gonna be us, okay? That's really... That's not fair. I need you to understand... - What? - That we will not have kids. Stop saying that, Peter. Okay. This is a big pill to swallow, that's all. Darling, we have been doing this for 10 years. For 10 years, okay? And we need to start something new. This is over now. We will not have children, so fuck that. So fuck that? Yes. I have to go. Peter. I am still here. Come find me, Mommy. No, 10 ships, 10 ships. 120,000 ton capacity each. Yes, and we need another 50 trucks for the... Yes. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Hey, this is Peter's mailbox, please leave a message. Good morning, Nina. Good morning, Maria. Your 12:45 meeting has been changed. Alice is holding a video conference at 4:30. This is Sasja Simpson from the childcare organization. She has a half hour with you before the morning meeting. Hello, I'm glad that I can finally meet you. I'm sorry, we'll have to postpone for a few minutes. Okay, I'll wait. Company is... Hello, hello, sorry, I'm late. It's no problem. So look, these are the facts. London Woods GAM are running. There is an increase in prostitution in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Well... I'm only asking you to reroute in the border region. If you do that... We cannot do that. - It will stop the worst of it. - No, no way. Forty percent of all these prostitutes are below the age of 16. Many have unwanted children and these children end up in prostitution. We are doing what we can. I'm talking about infants. About a very... Mommy. There are babies. They're dealing with babies, you know. I've been there. I love you. And it will give you nightmares, Magnus. You know, you have to deal with the fact that you're responsible... We'll reroute. What did you say? We'll reroute. Thank you. Why are they selling their babies? Don't they love them? What do we do then, Maria? Maria? I'll look into it. Thank you all. I'm sorry I'm making you sad. I don't know where to go. I only have you. This is Maria, leave a message. Hey, it's me. Um, I just got back and... I need to be alone for a while. I'm staying at the Atlantic. Give me some time, okay? I'm sorry. Yeah? Peter? What are you... What are you doing here? Please come home. You know, Maria... I need you. I need some time. I just don't want us to give up. You will not get pregnant. Do you know that you died? I saw you dead. And you came back. You want to keep doing the same thing. But... But we could talk to the adoption agency again. Charlotte can get us... Yes, she can, a child, within a year. I can't do it. Can't do... Can't do what? I don't... I don't want to adopt children. You have to let it go. I want a child. I... I... I cannot come with you. You know I can't come with you. I'm sorry. I cannot. I can't. Can we just be sad together? You know? We'd just be a sad couple. Fuck it. We have money, we'll just do whatever the fuck we want. I can't. I can't. Nina speaking. It's me. Hi, Maria. Do we still have those papers Sasja left? The papers, um, yeah, the ones about the rerouting? Wait, let me see. I think they're here. The ones on the... Do you remember the names of the towns that she said to avoid along the route? Let me see, okay. It was especially bad on the Czech-German border region and that's the area we're focusing on with our research. So you don't know the names of the towns? I need a name. Uh, okay, well, let me see. Oh, um, heavy prostitution along the 55 between Derby and Hertfordshire. Where the kids were been sold? Uh, one moment. Cheb, that's the one. Cheb is the center for child trafficking controlled by the Russian mafia. Um, let me see, 80% child prostitution... Okay, thank you. Fuck. Look, Mommy, there is a raindrop. Give me back my money. Give me back my money. Stop, stop. Get off me. Look, it's like a fairytale. He looks sad. Hi. Thanks. Are you going to Paris? Prague. It's okay. Are you American? No, I'm, uh... I'm French Canadian. Oh. My name's Maria. Pleasure. My name is Christian, but a few people when I work, they call me Petit. Petit? That's right. Are you a panda bear? Um... actually, this just a costume I had for the German WWF organization. It's, uh... It's how I... make my Euro. Does it pay well? Pays like crap but, I mean, for me it's... it's... It's only okay. What do you do then? I take seasonal work. Christmas Elf, Summer Garden Gnome. Depends. Whatever I can do. It's a nice car. What do you do? Uh... Uh, I'm a managing director. You okay? Yeah, just... just... Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. I mean, you don't look all right. You don't look okay. I'm tired. It's been a long day, and I'm broke. I can give you money. Yeah? I can't have children. Sorry. I... I heard of this town, this Czech town, on the German border. And they're selling little children into prostitution, and so I've come to save one. Save one? Yes, to get one. But I don't think I can get access if I go there alone. Do you understand? But you could. Um... I mean, maybe I'm not explaining this well... I would be very happy if you'd pull over as soon as possible. Please, just listen. Please stop the car. - Please, don't... - Stop the car. Please, don't... Let me out. Please don't leave. Christian, I just need your help, that's all. You need help. Please stop. Just hear me. Leave me alone! I said, fuck off. I'll give you 10,000 Euro. Cash. Just help me get in touch with these people. That's all I'm asking. That's it? For 10,000? I know why you asked me. There was... There was something about you. No, it's because you're not afraid of me. Come on, come on. It's beautiful. It's 7 o'clock. We can make it in four hours to Cheb. Maria. Maria? What? I need a fix. I need a fix. Okay. I can't make it to Cheb. Please, I'm going to need you to give me some money. But you don't get the money now. I don't get a fix, I can't help you. Drive to the next big city. Okay. Pull over up there. Let's just get out of here. No, I need a hit. Pull over. You ever try anything like this? No. It's making me sort of nauseous. What's your deal, Maria? You're just some rich woman who can't have kids? Uh... I just want a baby. My life won't be complete without children. It's like I have no purpose at all. And you say that to a homeless dwarf with a drug problem? Does it feel better to be on heroin... than real life? You call this real life? Looking for babies in the middle of the night? Is that funny? Oh, is that funny? Mama, I had a dream. I saw all these incredible lights. They were floating in the air. They were so beautiful. But if you look closer... it was the souls of unborn children. And I was one of them. Then I woke up. Am I real, Mommy? Am I real? Wake up. We're outside Cheb. Thank you for doing this. I'm just doing it for the fucking money. All these girls. Poor things. I'd fuck 'em. Be quiet. Maria, in your little world people have sex because they want to have a kid or... Stop. I don't know, it's Wednesday night. But these girls... Shit, they're heroes. They can't think that way. They got to survive. It's human nature. Let's see if we can get some information. Have you thought this through at all? Go and talk to some of these girls. See if you can find out where they live. Please. None of these girls are gonna say a word to me... unless I have some euro. Here. Fuck. This is not a plan. Please. Yep. What are you doing? Excuse me. Christian. Christian. Christian. What are you doing? Fuck you! What did he say? Goodbye. Fuck off. Stupid woman. Fuck off. Excuse me. Cell phone? Excuse me. Cell phone? No. Please. How stupid can you be? This car is worth more than 10,000. Never trust a junkie, never. Fuck. I'm looking for a hit. Okay, I get you drug when you go fuck. No. No girl, just the drugs. Just go pick a lady. I have extra money. I can pay for the girl. I just... Just want the drugs. First girls, then drugs. Just go pick a lady. Look, I just need something for the road. I don't need a lady. I just need a hit. I can give you money for both, just skip the girl. We won't skip the girl. Wait a second. So, here's the girl for you. You're fucking kidding. You don't like her? That's not really the point. What is she 14, 15? Fifteen. She's legal. Terrible. Sit. Let's sit over here. No, come here. I good. I need a hit. Why don't we just wait 10 minutes? I'll tell 'em everything was cool... They give me a hit, and I'll go. I fuck you good, then drugs. What is that sound? Relax. Stop. Stop. No, it's okay. Relax. No, let me up. Sit. What's in here? Nothing. Come with me. No. Let me open it. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Is this your baby? Yeah, but no notice. And I still tight. It... It... no notice. You have him in the fucking cupboard. Is that tape? Yeah, for business. It's okay. No worry. Fuck. Baby don't know, and I still young. Come. You need money, right? Money is important? Have sex. I... No, I have money. For sex and drugs. No. For the baby. One hour. You leave for one hour, and I give you everything I have. Fuck me. No, we both know you need this. Okay? Come on. Make up your mind. Do it now. Take it. It's a lot of money and you need it. All right. I'm being patient with you. But you need to be smart about this. It's a lot of money I'm giving you. And you'll have your baby again in one hour, okay? Look. My baby. That's okay, but he'll just be my baby for an hour. There's a lot of money here. Babies don't remember things. I remember. Well, you won't remember because you won't be here. 'Cause after I give you the money, you're gonna go. No, I stay. No. Yeah. No, you don't stay. For this money, you leave. Take it. The baby will be fine. You need to go, now. Come on, be a big girl. It's not the end of the world. Go. Let's see if we can find a way out of here. I got you. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. You're okay. Shh. Fuck. Kill you, you fucking shit. Where the fuck... Shh. Come on, we need to go. Go. It's okay. Oh, my god. Where did you get it? I got it from one of the girls. How? She just thinks we have it for a bit. Did you steal it? I found it in a cupboard.

Yeah. Don't think I've ever done this before. How do you know if they're the right size? It says newborn. It's okay. How is she doing? Is she... Is she hurt or anything? No, she's fine. It's okay. I think, uh... I think you'd... be happy you never saw where she was. Her mom was just a kid. I don't even think she wanted her. You did a great thing. I thank you for it.
