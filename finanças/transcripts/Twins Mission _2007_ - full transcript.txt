Brother, we have been separated for ages. I am really happy to hear that you are coming to visit me, My condition has worsened. My days are numbered. You’re my only family. When I am still conscious, I hope to have a great chat with you. This request is quite simple, but I am satisfied already. Uncle Luck. Come on, don’t be upset. We are escorting the “Heaven’s Bead” to Hong Kong. This is really a good deed. I hope this will benefit your brother. - Master, are you alright? - Take care of yourself. You got altitude sickness when we were up on the hill. Now, you got the flu down here and you got car sick on the ride. Hong Kong is so badly air polluted. Master, I've asked someone to make you some rice porridge. Yes. If you don’t eat, you’d have nothing to vomit. Here it is. Here is the food, please help yourself. Stay where you are. Drop the Heaven’s Bead, and I’ll let you go. Get down. Keep the money in a safe place. - Let’s split and search for it. - Okay. Excuse me, have you seen a blue van around here? Where did he go? Which part of Hong Kong? Wow! Look at that, ladies and gentlemen! It will get better! Spectacular, isn't it, people? All the audiences are impressed. Last night I dreamt of David and me performing the magic saw. David cut the beauty, that’s me. Last night I dreamt of David getting married. The bride was me. - Stop bluffing. - You too. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you. This pair of twin sisters love each other so much, they have good discussions on everything. Here comes the climax. They will spin in the air for four turns. This is the greatest show in the world. Only this pair of twin sisters can do it. They are Jade and Pearl. Let’s count together. One, two... Four turns. That’s really cool. Let’s give a big hand to Jade and Pearl. Stop! You cunning girls, you lied again. You spun only twice and made us promote it as four turns? We didn't have time to count. See? They still gave us a big hand. It’s really hard to make four turns in the air. - We are trapeze artists, not superwomen. - That's right. You two are good at nothing but talking back. Forget it. I was going to give you something good. - I think I can save it now. - What is that? Here. - It's an autograph. - Is that real? Of course it's real. I know you girls have been longing for it, I asked my friend to get it from David. - I want it. - Wait. Highest bid wins. - You want us to pay? - Let's get changed. Wait! Why are you so snobbish? Happy. Please feed her some rice porridge first. Happy, I bought you a doll. Isn't it pretty? Happy, the doctor told me you didn’t eat well. I've made you some rice porridge, be good and eat it all, okay? - Come on. - Happy, the doll's hair is so beautiful. You have lost much hair, and it is looking quite ugly, but it will grow out soon. Please eat it. What’s wrong with you? Hey. Happy. Happy, are you alright? She didn’t eat much, but vomited this much. Happy is trying a new treatment. Vomiting is the side effect. - She suffers a lot. - Alright. - It’s almost time for us to go now. - Where are we going? We're going to watch Phantom of The Opera. You have to give me time to get changed. There's no need for it. Okay. So we don't watch it tonight. I’ll buy tickets for another day. I mean I don't need it anymore. Go away. I need to stay here to accompany my sister. I am sorry. I am sorry, ma'am. It’s okay. Please wait. Mr. Mok, Ms. Li has arrived. - Lilian. - Professor Mok. I am your father’s old friend. Why don’t you greet me as uncle? You don't need to call me Professor Mok. Professor Mok, I have so many uncles, but Professor Mok is the one and only archaeology expert in the world. You are so sweet. The price offered by our group is really very high. Why don’t you accept it? Professor, you've known me since my childhood, and you know my personality very well. My dad left everything to me before his death. How can I sell the ancestral homes? Right. Being a good daughter is good. But this is not the proper way to do business. No one is as conservative as you are now. Say, I am this old now, but I am still learning to be open-minded and aggressive. We make money by doing business. I will never let you lose. I want a win-win situation. The building of the most deluxe and top financial center in the world, is stopped by these old houses. Isn't it a pity? I have never meant to blame you. But it’s obviously the fault of the Qing Dynasty. The Qing government shouldn’t have buttered up the British. They sold the land for one dollar only. And stated that no new buildings around could be taller than it. Your father was so smart to buy those British properties. But it is now another century. Why should we still stick to the old laws? Now I feel tied up by those old houses. You refused to sell them. I have no children of my own. I always treat you and your sister as my own children. Your sister is sick now. I have contributed so much to her. Actually, I've been in touch with her doctor. Since we all know the modern medicine can’t cure her sickness, why does she have to try so many new Chinese medicines, she is not a lab rat. Sister. Sister. Sis, I don't want to die. Sis, please save me. Please save me. This is the priceless “Heaven’s Bead”. It can bring people back to life. At first, I just didn’t believe. My cousin got cancer a decade ago. Fortunately, he got it and included it as a medication. He recovered and is now over 80 years old. He is still healthy now. Since all the doctors can’t cure her, you should treasure every single chance. If you lose, you’ll only lose a piece of land. But if you win, you’ll win your sister's life. How can I tell if the bead is real? Silly girl! I won’t cheat you. The Heaven’s Bead can be forged, but I can’t make the government announce that it has been stolen, right? Where did you hide the Heaven’s Bead? Tell us now! Or you will die a slow and horrible death! Did you know? Rats in the gutter see no light. When they are in darkness, what do they do? They run to seek exits by all means. Be alert. The Heaven’s Bead must be around. Search every man he hung out with. What's going on? Rats. Don't come closer. Step aside. The police are working. Don't push... - What is it? - It could be rat's hair. The witnesses told me the rats came out from his body. No way. I've seen a lot of intestinal parasites. But I've never seen rats. He wouldn’t have died if we had found him earlier. Who are you? Officer Lam, they came for the deceased. So we brought them to you. They are the lamas who reported the loss of the Bead. I am not a lama, I was raised by a lama. I am not a lama either. I see. Not lamas, right? You are looking for trouble then. - Jimmy, let them join us. - Yes, sir. Hey, you two. Help us catch the rats. - No, take them back for investigation. - Yes, sir. SEX TOYS SHOP Police. Hey. You must know this guy. Stay here. Anyone witnessed the crime? SWAHILI SWAHILI, POSSIBLY! - What did she say? - You didn't get that? She said she witnessed how he died. FILIPINO FROM WESTERN PHILIPPINES SHOULD BE... - What did she say? - She said that after he swallowed the rats, he ran out like crazy. AFRICAN DIALECT AFRICAN DIALECT, MAYBE... She said that he wanted to defend himself, but his neck was squeezed. AFRICAN LAZY SOUND And then, finally, he jumped to his death. What? Anyone of you saw this thing? Then you should know who is the murderer. Say it. You have nothing to say? Take them all back. Jimmy, remember this name. - This may be the suspect's name. - Yes, sir. How dare you surround the police? Alright. Call now from backup! Calm down, sir. He sells sex dolls on the third floor. What are sex dolls? Those dolls that you blow up. I see. Blow-up sex dolls, right? Sir, I just want to advise you. This is not Central, it's a chaotic place. They have their own laws here. The police can't do anything they want. I don’t care. I am not arresting them. I am inviting them to cooperate in this investigation. Is that a problem? She asked why you want to arrest her. You know her language? I suspect she hasn’t told the truth. Ask her again. I see. You got it all wrong. She saw Chou buying a lot of products. What about you? She said he couldn't eat, he was in great trouble. She said no one buys this quantity, even if the products are 50% off. She said he just had no reason not to jump to death. Sir, ask me to translate for you next time. Don't embarrass yourselves. It doesn't make sense. They had said the name of the suspect. The name was... “Pokiliala”? With all due respect, are you kidding? That's a Hong Kong slang. What does that mean? She said she wanted to fucking complain against you. Fucking complain against you. Your Cantonese has improved so much. Let's go. What about me? CHIMELONG PARADISE Why is it in your hands? Because of money. If I really had money, would I still be here? I should have enjoyed my life in the U.S. It's all for money. You made an under-the-table deal? If I were able to pay, I'd offer $50. I am sorry, I offered $100. Give my hundred dollars back. That’s none of my business. If you want the money back, ask him to pay you back. - Who? - Mr. Hippo. Principal, I am Lau Hay. You came alone? How about your chubby godfather? Have some beer first. I've quit beer for a long time because of my high blood pressure. There you go. You’re too old to play such tricks. This kid still remembers that you love eating peanuts. Still playing tricks, huh? Have you read this article? ECLIPSE MAGAZINE What is it with you? I suspect his death is related to the lost Heaven’s Bead. What do I have to do with this? - It was done by the Twins. - Idiots. The Twins have been gone for ages. I saw them, and I fought with them. Cut the crap. I owe you a peanut. Since you still insist on it, just forget it. It's just a peanut, you don’t need to pay me back. Hello? Stop! Sorry, ma'am, I'm not a bad guy. Could you give me a ride? I am sorry. I am sorry, ma'am. Please... just a ride. Thank you. We are twins. He is my elder brother. This is his favorite model of car. But he's never had a chance to ride in it. What is his sickness? Cancer. The last stage of it. Hey. If you need to, I can take you for more rides. It’s okay. He doesn’t need it anymore. I think, he is satisfied already. Hay, its dawn now. Why haven’t you come yet? I am here. Turn around. What is it? My brother... has passed away. Are you okay? Do you need a break? I am okay. This is life. Everyone lives, and dies. It is like horse racing. Some horses can run long races, others, short ones. Some run fast, some run slow. But then they all go back to the stables. I got it. POSSESSED AND GONE CRAZY RATS CAME OUT FROM GUTS Watch out! The Twins? Show some respect. How dare you hit your senior? You call yourselves Twins? Don't you know there are girl and boy twins? Brother, let’s teach him a lesson. Brother. Run. Uncle Luck. Uncle Luck, are you alright? I am okay. My leg! EASTERN HOSPITAL Uncle, you’d better drink less at your age. You won’t be that lucky next time. He didn't drink. He got beaten. Don’t you believe it? You can do an alcohol test on him. If it's an assault, I must report to the police No! I got drunk. No more bull shit. He got drunk too. The Twins are trash nowadays. They bully in a gang to outnumber their enemies. Uncle Luck, now, with you hurt, it will be even harder to find the Bead. I've told you not to be nosy. You just didn’t listen. Do you think that I'm happy to see you got hurt? If I recover, I will take revenge on them. I don’t think a Buddhist like yourself should be this bad-tempered. Even the Buddha would be angry this time. And you. Don't think they won't notice you, and you'll be able to escape from everything. I am the target this time, next time it will be you. You just love cursing me. Won't you be happy if I die? Back then, you left the kid to me. I've raised him for over ten years. Now, you avoid your responsibilities in front of me? Just give me an answer. We will be friends only if you help me. How can I help, buddy? Ask your twins to help me, now! - Thank you, Jade. - You’re welcome. Hey. Are you paying again? I always keep my promises. It is because Arsenal lost the match again last night. It's not promise-keeping. It's called gambling. Why don’t you pay me back instead? What’s up? Do you know what these are? This is called “No-pay.” This is called “No-return.” - Do you know what this is? - What? I always take it off when bathing. It's called “Don't-wash-away-your-money.” You wish. Pay me back right now. You bitch. How dare you pull my hair? - Let go. - You let go. - I won't let go if you don't. - Hey. It hurts. Hey. Jade and Pearl, look who's here? What the heck? Actually they are good girls. They always practice for their performances. They also practice their kung-fu quite a lot. I am here today to bring Jade and Pearl to Hong Kong. We are in a hurry, we need to go now. What? Do you think this is a refugee camp? Back then, when you dumped these kids here, I didn’t ask for a penny. I wasted so much food and time on them. I spent so much effort on them. Yes, you taught them kung-fu, but they'd never have gotten famous without my help. Now you want to take them back by bringing me a basket of fruits? Honestly, you can’t take them away without paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I mean for each. We won’t go even if you can pay a million. You can never settle what you owe us in this life. Pervert. - Look. - And mine too. We were too little to call the police. If not, you would have been in jail now. See this scar? We can’t even join a beauty pageant. And you thought just sending letters would work? I have counted. After all these years, you sent 1,024 letters to us. We didn’t read any of them. - You sent a total of $10,240 in them. - We didn't spend a penny. We'll give it all back to you. Just return the letters. We can keep the money. It's just a little bit of money. We don’t care. I'm sorry. Please forget that I came here today. Wait! Come on. It doesn’t matter. Some people are hilarious, not sure why would he show up uninvited to take the blame Maybe he is dumb. - He promised to raise us. - And pay for our education. - Even the promise of hamburgers. - Was not fulfilled in over a decade. Get changed. Don’t trust anything he says. Liar. I know you hate me. If I didn’t do that to you, you wouldn’t have had a chance to grow up. Principal! Awesome. Principal! - Are you insane? - You’ve gone too far. Go away, go away! Principal! Principal. Are you okay? You four. I won’t forgive you if the principal gets hurt. - He used to be so powerful. - How come he is so weak now? We all will get old! I see. So old people will be useless. - Principal, are you alright? - Principal. Everyone in the Twins gets a hand mark. My brother and I went a different way. I wanted you guys to be educated. But he wanted you to help him do bad jobs. I didn't expect... that he would attack me. - Principal, no. - No! - Principal, no. - Please don't. At that time, I couldn’t stand that anymore. So I had to get rid of your marks, and sent you to somewhere safe to avoid him. Had you not left the Twins, you would have died, or you would have become criminals. - What are you looking for? - Where is my stuff? - Principal. - What are you looking for? Principal... - What are you looking for? - What is it? - Let me help you. - Go away. - Let me help you. - What are you looking for? - Please let me help you. - What are you searching? - What are you searching? - Could you let us help? I didn't lie to you. It's a bit late for the hamburgers, but I really didn't lie. It’s flattened. I don't think it's edible now. It’s a bit flat. I think we can still eat it. I want to eat it too. Hey. Don’t forget the ketchup. DAO ZHOU, MASTER OF ROBBERS. The actors worship Hwa Kang. The architects worship Lu Ban. The Twins worship Dao Zhou. But the Twins, as an organization, ended a decade ago. Your identity as thieves was gone too. The aim of worshiping Dao Zhou again, is not to re-establish the Twins, but to recall the spirit of the Twins. Even thieves have their rules. From now on, what you learn from the principal, will only be used in this mission. After that, you can’t use it anymore. Also, you must forget everything. Including your identity. Our body is burnt in the fire to lighten up our spirits. You taught them that? Are you okay? - Are you okay? - What? Are you okay? Are you okay? What? What's up? Listen up. The police have something to say. You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so. But what you say... Let's go. The police are working, please leave. The police are working, close all the business. Well, you may regret what you're doing. The Heaven’s Bead for tomorrow’s exhibition was stolen on the way to Hong Kong. It is believed that it’s been brought in Hong Kong, although this information has not yet been confirmed. Damn it. It jammed it. Just put it here. Be around him and wait for him to fall into the trap. A piece of blade and a cigarette can be transformed into magic. Wow. - I am sorry. - While you say how sorry you are, take his money. Are you done switching channels? I keep switching because the shows are boring. You will mess up with the TV. Stop. Not this channel, go back. Professor Mok, who do you think would steal Heaven’s Bead? It is not a Picasso painting. It is not the Cullinan Diamond either. So it doesn't have a recognized value in the global market... - Are you alright? - ...and is not an international theft. Can I change the channel? It's so boring. Well, for those who do not know it... Principal. ...it's just a rock found in the Himalayas. It’s not counted as precious. For those mentalists, they think it is God’s treasure, that it gives them God's power... They believe that it has super power to end disasters, or save people from death. To me, its value is zero because I am healthy. But to those who have incurable disease, it gives them hope of survival. They would pay whatever the price. He is such an asshole. He seems to be a gentleman. Actually, he is a scum. Don’t be fooled by his decent look. He just pretended to be an expert. I've known him for 20 years. He has never told the truth. Let’s not waste time. Go get Hay back now. When he is off from work, that's the only chance we have to steal the access key card from him and from the security. Then, Jade and Pearl will go to the roof to open the safe-box. Remember, time is limited. We have to put the cards back or we’ll be discovered. - You only have 15 minutes. - Yes, sir. Sir, can you please take my card out? What? Right there? Come on, don't be shy. Please give me a hand. Help! He touched me! - He touched me! - There's a misunderstanding. - Help! - What's going on? Your colleague touched me. No. She asked me to help her take the card out. - It shouldn't be like this. - Alright. Ma'am, maybe it’s just a misunderstanding. - Open the door. - Okay, I am sorry. - I am sorry. - Watch out. Stop! You stole my stuff! Wow. You stuffed so many things on your butt. - It’s a mobile wardrobe. - Let’s get changed. You don’t want to take them off? It’s a G cup, I better keep it as long as possible. Not everyone has it. It is so hard to find an exit. There must be a gap, let’s look for it. Wow. It’s five inches wide. - It’s more than enough. - Right. It moves. It's coming again. I stole from you? Take a good look at him first. I don't care. I have many rich friends. Do you think rich people won’t steal? Do you read the newspaper? Once they reported... a rich man loved stealing silk socks just for relaxation. How do I know if Mr. Mok doesn't have the same craving? It's coming again. Your legs. You boobs. Your G cup almost killed us. I won't blow it that big next time. Do you need to be this exaggerated? This is how an office should look. But you need a ride when you need to pee. We just have 15 minutes. Let’s split and search. Check whether you have lost something. You can’t tell one’s heart from his face, right? Where is my phone? - What did you lose? - Where's my iPod? - They’re gone. - It's true. All right. Let's call the police then. Sure, I am scared of nothing. - Who called the police? - I did. Sir, I did. - He's causing trouble here. - He stole my stuff. That's serious. Follow me to the police station. Sir, I have nothing to do with it. I don’t know who dumped them in my bucket. - Oh my purse. - That’s mine. You want to open the safe box with these? Better trim the skin to have better feeling. The safe box is so big. I don’t think it will help. Principal is so outdated. Now, everything is settled then? They are found, so it is all right. Give me your I.D. card. Mr. Mok, everyone knows who you are, sir. But... your I.D. card please. Please. Thank you. Don't move! Sir, we are just passing by. I.D. card. Thank you, Mr. Mok. Be careful from now on. Alright, go about your day! Leave now! And take your personal belongings. Go, go, go! - Why are you so nervous? - That's right. You didn't see it? The badge on the hat is wrong. You guys aren't leaving? Do you want to get caught? You are lucky today. - Because no one noticed that. - That's right. Sister... I don't want to die. - Hey. - I'm candy man. Go away. This little girl is not happy. - But her name is Happy. - Let's come back later then. We have to think of something. What about this one? This one is yours. How did you do that? I will teach you if you take the pills. Okay. Pinky promise? Pinky promise. There you go. Do you like snowman? I like when it snows. I want to go to Japan to watch the snow. My sister has promised to take me there. But I am sick. I can’t watch the snow now. - Do you know how to make snow? - Of course. I don't believe you. I won’t lie. Otherwise I will become a turtle. So, can you make snow in this room? Well... Let me see... If you do it, I will take the medicine every day. Deal. Thank you. My sister cannot only talk, but take her medicine too. Well, she is a good girl. - Hey. - Master... your trick was awesome. Can you teach us? Sure. Remember to take the pills. I didn't expect that you’d return my favor this soon. Actually, I came here... to see you. Do you know Professor Mok? He is one of my uncles. Forgive me, but do you have any business deals with him? I got this card from Professor Mok. A piece of land, a patient, and the Heaven's Bead. With all these three things I guess, I can figure something out. But I don't think it is a good decision. If you are so smart, you should know why I did this. And you must have heard what my sister said at the end. When can you bring the Heaven’s Bead to me? Old man, you failed. Don’t put the blame on us. I've done what I should do. I told you to steal it discretely, but you robbed it. After you robbed it, you lost it. Alright. When the boss asks about it, we will be in trouble too. We've tried our best. You want me to bare your trouble, and now you want me to stand your temper? We kept an eye on Fred a whole day. What else do you want? It will be too late. The little girl in the hospital can’t wait. If she dies, we gain nothing. Even if you get the Bead back, I will bury you guys with her. - Hello, Ming? - Hey, Fred. No ship is available. When will it be available then? In five days. Hello? Hello? I've told you not to waste food. Have I lost my mind because of hunger? Who are you? - We are social workers. - We've come to help you. I hope I can eat you all. Hey. - Hey. - Are you sick? I heard you’ve got something nice. There are no good things left. Even if there are, they have broken already. But your friend Chou got something nice, right? Chou, again? Sir, we've come to help you. Yes, we are social workers. You are social workers, You are social workers, too. Why are there so many social workers in Hong Kong? Where are you from? We are from the Samaritan. If you are from the Samaritan, then we are from Somalia. We share the same goal. Social workers, - Do you have any food? - I do. How about chocolate? I have dried pineapples. I have... chewing gum. There are so many inside. How about pain killers? Better than nothing. Are you kidding me? How about taking my condom? If they were edible, I would have eaten them all. For a dying person, it’s so hard to get a full meal. I know that you are looking for the Heaven’s Bead. If... If anyone buys me some Chinese barbecue, I will give the Heaven’s Bead in exchange. Don't judge a book by its cover. It turns out that you're not that stupid. Do you think you can watch him alone? Jade, where are you going in such a hurry? Fred got the Bead. I am getting him food. Then where's Pearl? You need to pay for the pen. Hey! What? Watch out for the lamp. Be careful. The Heaven’s Bead. Run? I haven’t had enough fun yet. Run. Go away. You are from the Twins too? Hey. Help me out. Move! Out of the way! Over there. Give it to me. Hey. What? Hay Lau. - Are you alright? - I am fine. Call the ambulance. Are you kidding? I don't think you are fine. Hello? We’ll be right there. Drive me to the hospital first. Boss. Happy, do not be grumpy. Be good. Okay? Miss Li, please don’t stir her emotions. I don’t think we can do the operation now. Doctor, I don’t mean to stir her up. She just wants to see someone. Are you the little girl called Happy? I am Happy's sister. - And you are...? - Actually, Hay sent us here. He had an accident and got injured. He's now being seen by a doctor, and will be here soon. Kid, do you love watching magic? It's not an aquarium, but you can still see jellyfish here. They are in white, green and blue colors. Aren't they cute? You lied. You are liars. Happy. My sister doesn’t want jellyfish. She wants snow. Ma'am, we have tried our very best. We have everything here. Such attitude is not okay now. It so tiresome to be romantic. Come on. It’s your turn now. Hey. Doctor! Help! Help! You are awake. - Where is Happy? - Forget about her first. I have something important to tell you. But don’t be mad. Do you remember who you give the Heaven’s Bead to? - To you, Principal. - Did you? Surely you gave it to my brother. What? Chang Yung? I won’t blame you, my ex-girlfriend mistook him as me too. What? What happened then? She became his wife. Where is Lilian? Where is Lilian? Where is Lilian? Who is Lilian? Lilian is the girl who comes to see if he's awake every five minutes. I see. I just saw her around, but she has gone now. Hello? Stop her. That call must be from Professor Mok. Let's go. Come on. Do you think there's something in Hay and Lilian’s eyes? - What? You mean dirt? - No. Let’s split and search. I’ve got you. I’ve got you. Hold on. Hay has got something to tell you. Do you think Heaven’s Bead can save your sister? I grew up with the Heaven’s Bead. If it really could save life from death, I would have used it to save my brother. There are a lot of solutions for every problem. But don’t choose the most stupid one. Thank you. Hello? Lilian, I have prepared a big present for Happy. Come to my office now. I don’t think we should meet. Miss Li, I am not your uncle. My name is Chang Yung. I know that your sister has just received a big operation. She should really rest. But I am so worried about her. So I took her with me without informing you. But I was so careless that I forgot her medicine. Please bring the medicine here for her. And don’t forget the documents. Don’t delay, I won’t wait for too long. And don’t bring cops with you. If the cops shows up, your sister's life will be in danger. Follow her. Happy. Happy... Happy. Have you seen my sister? Where is she? She was in the room. Happy... I am sorry. Happy. Happy... Hello? Sam, listen up. Bring all the documents that Professor Mok sent to me. Then meet me at Mok’s Building. Yes, right now! I don’t think this is right. I've known her dad for ages. This will harm the girl. Do you want to retreat now? Fine. We end it. I don’t want to work with you anymore. Alright. Shit. The elder one is settled, but the younger one was caught. - You mean Happy? - His brother did it. Get Puppy, Kitten, Marco and Polo to go to the rescue. Sure. We'll bring the Heaven’s Bead back too. The siu-mai is delicious. Try one. No more food now. We've got to go now. - Move! - Wait for me. Look at you. If you go, you would only drag them down. Doctor, please do me a favor. I need 12mg of Meperidine. This guy is a doctor in Tibet. But don't listen to him. You still have the final decision. I’ve got something urgent to take care of. Just three hours, okay? - You run faster than I do. - Hurry. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door now! Miss Lilian Li, welcome to Mok’s Building. I hope you will come in alone. - I will go in alone. - Be careful. - Where is my sister? - Don't rush. Just sign the papers. To me your sister is useless. If I can't see my sister, I won’t complete the deal. I know you are anxious. Let me show you something. Sister. Sister... Sister, help me. Sister, I am scared. Where are you? Please come and save me now. The papers you want are right here, I’ll sign them for you now. Mok is useless. It takes less than a minute to sign those two papers. I know you are very concerned about us, but this would kill Happy. You’re right, I won't kill your sister, But they will. He put all the blame on us. He just wants to make us mad. Cut the crap. Let’s beat him! Give us the Heaven’s Bead, and we won't fight. Otherwise your pretty face will get hurt. - I hate men who are shorter than us... - By over three inches. Bitch. Principal and I will fix up here. You look for Happy, and you find the Heaven’s Bead. - The Heaven’s Bead is inside. - Save your sister now. We’ll get the Heaven’s Bead and will join you later. You haven’t changed at all. Don’t be silly. Can't you see how rich I am now? I know. Your future will bring you nothing. Nothing! You’re this old now. - Why are you so stubborn? - You’re mean instead. I didn’t expect that you would attack your brother. - I've never treated you as my brother. - Fine. I won't treat you as my brother either. Whoever stops me from making money is my enemy. Happy... Happy... Happy. Happy. I know this trick, too. Brother. Hey. Are you alright? You are always stupid. I can forgive you for being soft-hearted once. But twice? You just deserve it. Fatty. How dare you call me Fatty? Show some respect. I've told you I will get revenge after I recover. I promised I would return the Heaven’s Bead tomorrow. And I will also give you one million dollars. You liar! You will give me nothing. The guy who trusts you is passed out now. You will end up like him. What? Watch our super swing. Yes. Give me Five. Come and help me! You are so stupid. Why would they put it here to let you steal it? What should we do now? Don’t move. I know. It lives in a tropical forest. It’s the Amazon twin snake. It’s poisonous, even more than the cobra. Even the crocodiles are afraid of it. I learnt it from the Nat Geo Channel. Stop scaring me. I am plenty scared already. But this kind of snake won’t move alone. What? Are they the Twins too? Why are you standing there? Help me distract them now. Can you make larger movements? Actually, I am afraid of snakes. Run! I got them! Wait. I'm stuck. I'm stuck, too! There are two more. If I make it out of here alive, I swear I will never eat rice with snake again. Not even a salak. If there's one more, I won't be able to catch it. You are so disgusting! Happy... Lilian, don’t waste your time. You won’t be faster than me, even if you can fly. Sister, save me. Why are you making so much trouble? Just sign the papers. Let my sister go. Let her go now! Happy, are you okay? - Are you alright? - I am fine. And you? Is everyone alright? Anyone hurt? We are fine. - I am fine too. - Good girl. After this incident, I hope you will get well soon. Because you are strong. Happy! Happy. The Bead won’t help your sister, but Hay is a good doctor, Please let him try. I am fine. Such scum deserves it. You’re still softhearted. Your brother is dead, I’m sure you’re upset. However, if you want to cry, go home first, don’t cry here. Where is the Bead? - Where is it? - Did I give it to you? - When did you give it to me? - Come on, no kidding please. This is serious. - So? - It's not here. Did we drop it somewhere - when we were swinging? - No way. Where is Chang Yung? Where did he go? - Where is the Heaven’s Bead? - He's missing. Oh no. Everybody move! Go away! Be careful... Brother! Move him here. Subtitle translation by Hoikiu Chau
