STATE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND PRANA FILMS PRESENTS THIS MOVIE WAS WRITTEN IN 2017 AND FILMED IN 2019. ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REALITY IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL. THE PINK CLOUD Giovana. - Giovana. - Huh? Look at this. It's nothing. Attention! Close all your windows. Close all your windows and doors now. If you're far away from your house, get inside the closest building. Attention! Close all your windows. Attention! Close all your windows. Close all your windows and doors now. ...they still don't know what this substance is, some call it a toxic gas, others call it pink cloud. All we know so far is that it kills in ten seconds. The same phenomenon happened in many countries. To try and protect the people, streets have been cleared out. While some don't believe it's dangerous... No samples have been collected so far, so there's no way to know what this gas is. STUDENTS WERE VICTIMS OF THE CLOUD SECURITY CAMERA AT A UNIVERSITY IN NEW JERSEY, USA. Where are you? Are her parents there with you? Okay. How many of you are there? Hi, Diego. How is it going? Can I speak to your friend's dad? Yes, it's... Yes. I'm at a friend's house. Okay, sis. I'll call you in a few. Close everything. I think the bathroom window was open when I left, if you could close it... Check everything for me. All right. Okay, cool. Keep an eye on the old guy. Okay, we'll keep in touch. Thanks. What do you think this is? I don't know. Why doesn't it go through the gaps? Hi, mom. I'm okay. Calm down, mom. I'm okay. Yes, I am. I'm at your house. Because I am. I can't be here? No, there's a guy with me. I met him yesterday. - Hi, Gi. - Hi. Are you guys okay? Yes, we're playing Dance Dance. Do you have enough food? There's still a lot of popcorn and chocolate cake. Let me speak to your friend's dad. Her name's Débora, you've met her before. Sorry! Can I speak to Débora's dad? He's on the phone speaking to Bruna's mom, she's nervous. What about you, sis? Are you nervous? No, it's just fog, Deb's dad saw it on the news and said it'll end soon. Okay. Let me know when he can talk, okay? All right, see you. See you. Bye! - Hey, Gi. - Hey. What the hell is this? I wish I knew. Sorry I didn't call you earlier. How are you? I'm alone. Gustavo went to get some bread and is stuck at the bakery. Oh, no! How many people are there? Like five people. Uhm... I hope this thing goes away soon. Hands in your head. - Like this? - Uh-huh. I don't understand why this isn't on the news. How many people have died so far? Maybe it's not easy to find that out. Also, they must be trying to avoid panic. I need you to relax, okay? Homeless people... What happened to them? Because... We can talk about that later, okay? I need you to be relaxed, because if your body is tense I might hurt you. Inhale. I have to sleep on my stomach to forget how hungry I am. All the food is over? No, but we don't have much. Is there any cashew nuts, peanuts, walnuts? I don't know, Débora's dad is rationing everything, we can't take it without asking. Do you think it'll go away soon? Yes. When it's over, we can do something, just the two of us. Go camping. Uhm? Good idea. I gotta go. See you. See you. Besides, many countries are divided due to political matters. According to him, they need to focus on people's well-being. Federal government has informed the technology of supply delivery is already on its final testing stage, the tube should be installed in the next few days, which will happen remotely, using drones. People are nervous on social media, because technical faults might result in immediate contamination. Do you wanna wait in the bedroom? No. Look at this color. - Nice, isn't it? - Uh-huh. Oh, my God. Do you realize we look like an Indian couple? Are we a couple? We don't even have sex. Are you complaining? - No. - Oh... But why an Indian couple? Because the most traditional couples don't know each other until the wedding day, then they start living together and they have to start liking each other. Oh! But it's very easy to like me. See? But... It's not easy to like this juice. Happy birthday. Thanks. I'm sorry, can we skip singing happy birthday? At least make a wish, okay? All right. Do you really need to think what to wish for? You're right. I hope it works. Don't be upset, it'll go away. When? I saw the news today and they said it'll probably be over by Winter. It's about the climate change, you know? Cold weather makes the cloud condensation to dissipate. Hello? Hello? Hello, son. Happy birthday! Thanks, dad. How old are you now? Like 30? 32. You're getting old. Yes, I know. Have you drunk the juice the government sent us? Unfortunately, yes. Isn't it the worst thing you've ever drunk? I drank that cheap drink you gave me, it wasn't very good either. You're so ungrateful. Dad, is that Diego's phone? Yes. By the way, he wants to talk to you. - Hey! - Hi, Diego. - Shoot. - Hey, Yago. What's up? I'm good. Do you guys need anything? The pills your dad takes are almost over. There's a company that delivers, but they charge almost double the price. Okay, is there any medicine that he can stop taking right now? No. All right, so give me your account number and I'm gonna wire the money for medication and food, okay? No problem. Okay, thank you. Talk to you tomorrow. But, Yago... What about my payment? Of course! Your payment as well. Tell me how much and I'll wire you, okay? Okay. Thank you. Good night. Thanks, good night. Tell me, how can a chiropractor make money without touching people? I can help you for a while. Is that the therapy website? Uh-huh. Do you think it'll work? It already is. They asked to do a more elegant layout. This couch reminds me of a coffin. I know. But they insisted on it. What about the eye doctor's website? I haven't finished that one yet. But the one I made for the dance class was pretty cool. They liked it. Are you going to work for much longer? Probably yes. How is your professional life going? Has your old occupation slumped since the cloud appeared? You'll have a new occupation, a new career, and you deserve to be very happy! Join me! Good morning. Good morning. Let's play with something else? - Really? - Uhm... Like what? Come here, this is much better. Hmmm... Did you see something about that woman that was killed through the tube? What? Someone sent her a poisoned cake, were there any news about that? Is that your sex talk? Sorry. And did you see the photo of the two-headed rat? Shut up. Wait, wait... - You have condoms, right? - Uh-huh. If we stay locked in here for many years, will you want kids? - Let's talk about that later. - Uh-huh. Uhm... But do you want to have kids some day? No, I never wanted to. Why? Because I never felt like I wanted to. But when you're old, are you gonna be alone? You wanna have kids so someone can take care of you when you're old? No, I have lots of reasons to have children, I've told you that. Actually, I told you I wanted two. I want none. Okay, so we compromise and have only one. You don't like children? Of course I like children, I just don't want to have one. I won't be able to travel whenever I want, to wherever I want. I'll have to go to parent-teacher meetings, to those kids parties with lots of moms talking about children. Listen... If the cloud doesn't go away, there's nothing to worry about. This is so much worse, right, Yago? Do you want to raise a child in here? That's awful! Nobody deserves this. It's possible to be happy here. The child can be happy. You know what the problem is? You don't wanna give up your wishes. Yes, you're right. Is there a problem if I like my freedom? Do you have freedom with this cloud? I wake up any time I want, go to sleep any time I want, I get to choose what I want to get in the tube... Wow... Go to hell. Do you think the cloud is a punishment? Punishment? Maybe you don't want to have children, because you're too negative about the future. Negative? There's a cloud that can kill us outside and I'm negative? Uh-huh. All right. I know, but we're fine. Sure. Look, Yago, once this cloud goes away you'll be able to go and have as many children as you want with someone nice. But as long as the cloud is here, let's try and live the best way possible.

The other day I saw a show, They're on Cloud Nine, it was about people who found their soulmate because of the cloud. ...I'm learning a lot about myself right now. But I do think you're my soulmate. ...I'm a whole new person. Right? - I iron your clothes. - Yes. And I wash yours. Perfect couple. Yeah! I know that the cloud has bad things, but it also has good things. There are no more robberies, no more kidnapping, there are no more car crashes, you guys! I wonder if it's because no one can get to their cars? You idiot! Not even... ...at around 5pm, the light is more pink, you know. - It's great for selfies. - Hi, dad. - Awesome. - Hi. Can you talk? Yes, sure. Go ahead. Sometimes I want to kill Diego. Dad! Don't be dramatic. What's wrong? He always forgets to turn off the lights, his food is tasteless... He gives me loads of medications, I bet he's poisoning me. Dad, Diego is your nurse, not your cook. All right? You can't be mad at him, do you understand? I don't need anybody. I can't stand living with a fussy person like him. Dad, what did we talk about? I dreamt I was killing Diego twice. That's nonsense, dad. What's going on? When does your mom come home? Superior humans will know how to use the cloud in their favor, to make a better world. The cloud isn't here for nothing, it's suffocation, it's the return, it's the natural selection and your days are numbered. Goddammit! Maybe you could leave social media for a while? Dammit, Giovana! Leave social media? I'm alone. Do you know what it's like to be in the cloud alone? THE CLOUD WILL NOT KILL ME Oh! Hi. What's that, sis? A list of everything I won't be able to do because of the cloud. Don't do that. Can I read it to you? Yes. "Kiss a boy. Visit Australia. See a koala in person. Climb a volcano." Since when do you wanna climb a volcano? I don't know, but now I'll never be able to do it. "Swim in a lake. Go to a real party." What is a real party to you? With a DJ, dancing, drinking. Like the ones you go to. You have lots of parties with your friends too. It's not the same. Can I tell you something that's a little... embarrassing? Always. There's something I liked to do, that I didn't know I liked. When I was walking in the street alone, sometimes I was afraid that something could happen, you know? I used to walk really fast, kind of in the middle of the street, looking everywhere, I was so worried. Once I got home and nothing had happened, I felt so relieved, I felt victorious. I miss that too. I'm here with you. - Yes. - Aah... Listen, Yago, on her next contraction, put the gloves on, put some lube on your fingers, you're gonna check her cervix to see if she's dilated enough. Put the lube on your right hand, on those two fingers, your index finger and middle finger. Look, it's coming. Go, Yago. Yes. Put them together then you do a "V". Aah! Aah! It's very dilated. - It's very... - Very dilated, perfect. It's gonna be more frequent now, you're getting closer. Now it's time to push, okay? Use your feet, use your arms. Use your breathing, the contraction of your diaphragm. Think about the baby coming out. Also, put your hands in your vagina to feel your baby. Push, honey! Come on, Giovana. Breath and let the baby come. Let the baby come, let him. Yes. Aah! Push, honey. Push! Aah! Aah! Oh, my God! Yago, please, hold Lino's arms. Yes. Hold tight. - Giovana? - Yes? Now squeeze Lino's arm just a little, just to get a bit of skin. Okay. Right, once you've done that, you can go in with the needle. Okay. Okay... Oh... There, there. It's over. Get his pacifier, Yago. Here's your paci. - Yago. - Hm? Did you see what happened at a supermarket in Rio de Janeiro? No, I didn't. Check this out. Watch this. It looks like this guy that's sitting down stole something from this guy over here, from his shelf. Then the people from this aisle took sides for the guy that is sitting down, but people from the other aisle took sides for the guy who started this fight. And see what happens. Look, look. It looks fake. What do mean, fake? Giovana, just look at this 3D image, maybe they made it look like it's 3D. This is a security camera footage, Yago. And this is from a cellphone, and there are more cellphone videos. Obviously, this really happened. You enjoy watching this, don't you? What do you mean, enjoy? Don't you? You talk about it with great awe. "Yago, this happened, look at this... A woman jumped from a building." But you don't see anything, I'm showing what's happening in the world, you're not interested in anything. I don't understand why do you get upset about things that you can't change? You're alienated. - Alienated? - Yes. - I'm alienated? - You're too alienated. Uh-huh. At least I'm not paranoid, okay? Since when I'm paranoid? Okay, maybe paranoid isn't the best definition for you, but I do think you could be more relaxed. FIGHT AT A SUPERMARKET RESULTS IN DEATH Ah! Go! No, Lino, don't! Don't throw water at me! Don't throw water at mommy. Come here, let me bathe you. Yes. There you go. Mommy is going to tell you a secret: mommy can't stand daddy anymore. Mommy wants daddy to disappear. Disappear, like this. Oh! Disappear. Puff! Ah! It's raining! Like a ghost... Disappear like this. But mommy isn't mean, mommy isn't mean. Mommy isn't mean. Mommy isn't mean. But mommy isn't mean. No-huh. Not even a little. I can't even taste this juice anymore. It feels like... It's part of my tongue, it has become my tongue, you know? Good for you. What's wrong? Giovana... What's wrong? How many moles do I have on my belly? What? Answer me, how many moles do I have on my belly? Two. Why? I know how many moles you have on your back, you have seven. Sorry, I'm not... I know how many hairs you have on your head, even the gray ones, I know. - I don't get it. - This isn't normal. This isn't normal at all, no one's like that. No relationship is like that, it's not normal. I can't take it anymore, I can't. What's your name? Sabrina. And you are? Renan. And why are you in jail, Renan? Ouch. Did you kill someone? You don't wanna know. But I do wanna know. - Do you? - Yes. I did kill someone. - You did? - I did. How many people have you killed? A lot. A lot? I killed one... I killed two... Hi. What's up? Can we talk? Yes. What's your name? Flávia. Flávia... I think I've seen you near my work. What do you do? I'm a lawyer, you? I own a sex shop. I bet you meet a lot of weird guys, don't you? No. Most of my clients are women. Cool. What about you? Are there a lot of boring people around you? Why do you always get at lawyers? Yago! I'm not Giovana right now. But your character thinks like Giovana. I don't get at lawyers. You always say they're boring, and jerks and stuff. You're not a lawyer, what's the matter? But wasn't your ex a lawyer? What are you talking about? The ex that left you, you were together for 5 years, wasn't he a lawyer? No. Why are you talking about this right now? Why? Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay? Let's try this again. I... Hi. Hi, I'm... a writer. And you? I own a sex shop. Pick something else. Why? Because I can't take you seriously when you talk like that. You're right. We can't do it. You look ridiculous. - You're ridiculous, Yago. - Giovana. Just choose... I think we should break up. I tried, you tried. We can't do it anymore. We just can't. And... How are we going to... We can't break up. Each one of us gets one floor, one upstairs and one downstairs. What about Lino? We can take turns. Three days each. Five, seven, whatever works best. What about the kitchen? It's downstairs. So, we can make a schedule. Each one has their time there, so we don't even see each other. How long have you been thinking about this? It looked like it had been a lot longer. "When would we be able to see the island from behind?" He thought. It's funny, but right at this moment, he didn't really want to leave the island, go back to the continent, and face his problems and anxiety. Through the open window... - Hi, sweetie! - Hi. What are you doing? Nothing and you? Savory pastries. It looks delicious! They look beautiful. Yes, wow! I wish I could eat some. Honey! Remember what my therapist said? We shouldn't think things like that, be happy even if we're not together. Okay, I'm sorry. But I love pastries! And do you like me? I do. Honey, do you like this pink shimmer lipstick? I'm not sure it looks good. You look beautiful anyways. Honey, I'm gonna go take some pictures of these pastries and do a video with the smoke coming out of it and I'll come back later. - You're kidding me. - I'm not. I'll be right back. Call you later. Okay, see you. The wind started blowing more strongly too. Peaceful sounds, peaceful place. He thought: the best thing about an island is that when you get to it you can't go any further. The cloud isn't going to stop you from finding love. Infinite People connects you with people from all over Brazil. No one needs to be lonely. There are over 10 million users waiting for you. Download the app and say goodbye to loneliness. Infinite People. Where do you want daddy to cut? - Here. - Here? Okay. Just a second, I'm getting it... - With the scissors? - With the scissors. Did you know you're doubly stuck? You're stuck in this floor and in the apartment. Did you know that? Let me show you something. Do you wanna know what's inside? Uhn? What's inside? What's inside? Come, let's see. Come, put it on the floor. Come here. I wanna know what's in there. Uhn! - What's that? - There's a lot of these! And what's that? To put on the socket. It's a cloud. It's a cloud socket. How many clouds are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ten clouds? It's a lot of clouds. Plus that one is? One. Only one, right? There. - Look. - Take it out. Don't do that. No! No, let me do it, let me do it. You can't do that, kids don't mess with sockets. - It's on. - It is, isn't it? Lino. Come, Lino, come. Huh? Sit on your spot. Here. A plum. Do you want some bread now? I don't want bread with strawberry jelly. But you like this, son. You like strawberry jelly. - Eat it. - I don't want to. Come on, sweetie. Just a little bit. I don't want that. Do you want some bread? Uhn? Sweetie! You have to eat breakfast. Today is mommy's day, come here. Come here. Come on. Sweetie, come here. I wanna play. Yago, turn off the videogame. Argh... Yago, turn off the videogame. Come here, come. Come with mommy. Come, come. There you go. I don't want to. Have breakfast with mommy, okay? You can play another time. Today you stay with mommy, okay? - I don't want to eat! - What's wrong? Tell me, what's wrong? What's the matter? Today you stay with mommy. You can play with daddy tomorrow, okay? Yago. Yago. Come here, Yago. Yago. I'm here. Hi. Come here with me. Come. I wanna kiss you. You wanna kiss me? Kiss me. - I wanna see you. - Do you? I'm touching you. Paulina, Paulina. Giovana! The Wi-Fi is down. Can you turn it on? Hi, dad. He died. Who died? Marcelo. Who's Marcelo, dad? The nurse. It's Diego. Are you sure he is dead? Isn't he sleeping? Do you think I'm stupid? Uhm... Was it you? Of course not. You once told me you wanted to kill him. I never said that. And how did he die? I don't know, he was laying down in the kitchen. What do you mean, dad? Was he... bleeding or... Dead, on the floor. Thank you for my house, thank you for my health, thank you for my food, thank you for my family... Thank you for my house, thank you for my health, thank you for my food... TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES How are you? Same old same old. What did your therapist say? Well, she... She told me to take some antidepressants. But antidepressants won't make anyone appear in my living room. Maybe you could get one of those robot dogs. I already have one. You didn't tell me. Because I think it's ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. You need to do anything that can help you, Sara. Well, this dog doesn't help at all. I was used to work with 90 kids every day. Going from 90 kids to no one... Why haven't they come up with a solution for this cloud? Like a mask or something that allows us to go out? See people... How does this cloud kills you? In ten seconds? Ten seconds of what? For whom? From what? How does it kill you? Out came the sun And dried up all the rain And the itsy bitsy spider Climbed up the wall again Bum! She's stubborn and naughty Up, up, up And she's never happy Bum! Dammit. - I want light. - Don't worry, son. It'll come back soon, okay? Baby, it's nothing, don't be upset. Don't be upset, baby. Hey. Is everything okay? Yes, everything's fine. He's calmer now. Go with daddy, go with daddy. Do you... Do you want me to go back upstairs? No. Uhn... Mommy is gonna be on vacation until the light is back. Did you know that, son? Uhn... Until the light comes back we can play lots of games. What is vacation? What is vacation? It's when people don't work and can go wherever they want. You mean play, right? Yes, play. Play with whatever they want. Do you want some juice, sweetie? The juice is pink like the cloud. Careful, baby. Don't spill it. The juice is pink like the cloud, right, son? You're right. The juice is pink like the rug. What's wrong, sweetie? Do you like the pink cloud? Do you? I... It's part of our lives ever since we've been here. But one day it'll go away. Right. It'll be here for a while... Then we can wander around. But we don't know how long it'll take... Do you like it? Son... Do you? Do you? Yes. - You do? - Uh-huh. - Do you think it's cool? - Uh-huh. Let's change the subject and play a game. Listen up. - Everybody alive! - Alive. - And now? - Dead. Alive. Oh! Dead. Ouch! Ouch! Be careful, Yago. For God's sake! - Has this always been here? - Yes. The light is back! The light is back! Can you believe I'm a good cook now? I doubt it. Send me some through the tube so I can try. - I will, and you'll be amazed. - Hum... I watch many cooking shows on TV. Yago also watches those TV shows. Listen, I forgot to ask you something, but do you have any tips for when someone is nauseous? Why? Do you feel nauseous, sis? No, Bruna and Gabi keep throwing up all the time, they're pregnant. I'm sorry, what? They asked me not to tell earlier. What do you mean, they're pregnant? Who did it? Débora's dad, who else would it be? But did he rape them? Got them drunk? Of course not, calm down. They wanted to have sex with him. Julia, don't go near this guy and don't let him get near you, okay? Stay in your room, do you hear me? Stop being paranoid! You are too young to get pregnant. He had to be arrested. Ha ha! What's the difference having kids now or in 10 years? We'll be here and everything will be the same. I'm gonna order birth control pills and send through the tube, okay? Call me when you're less annoying. Julia! Julia! Your call is being redirected to voicemail and you may be charged after the beep. Come, Lino. Come on. Lino? What's wrong? Was it a nightmare? I dreamt... I dreamt we were in a canoe, the three of us. And there were horses running around. Giovana. Giovana. You need to accept it. Okay? It's been here for a while now. It's okay. I felt we were there for real. I felt it. I was sure we had gone out. Hey, hey. Look, be thankful for everything you have. Remember what I taught you? Be thankful for what you have. Lino? Just a minute, son. Do you want me to sing in Portuguese, English or Spanish? English is fine. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Blow them out, mom. What time is it? 6h15. I woke up very early to give you this gift. Dad bought it, but I picked it. Wow! Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. Hi, dad. Have you been taking your medication? Did you take them today? Who is this? It's Yago, dad, can't you see me? Wait. Is this better? Who's Yago? I'm your son, dad. It's me, Yago. I don't have a son. What do you want? This is your doctor, Mr. Rui, I wanna know if you've been taking your medication. It's hurting. Someone tied me up. I have a knot in my guts. Someone tied something in here and it hurts. There are some pills here. That's why you need to take your medication, Mr. Rui, because of that discomfort. What medication? I'm not stick. How do I turn this thing off? Mr. Rui? Mr. Rui? Uhn! Dad! Mom! Come and see the cloud! Oh... Look at the cloud! Why does he wake up so early? Come quickly, look! Many theories have been created about what the green color means, but it's all speculation so far. Some believe the green cloud is harmless and are confident they'll be able to go out soon, others believe this might be a sign of the end of humanity. Did you get your bikini? No, not yet. We need to bring sunscreen. No, we can buy sunscreen there. Julia, it's going to be so weird when we meet. But we video chat all the time, right? It's not the same. - Julia? - Yes? We'll get drunk together for the first time! We're getting out of here! We're getting out! We're getting out, Julia! - Woo hoo! - Woo hoo! We're getting out of this shit! Yeah! Cloud, please, don't go away, don't go away. Stay with us, please. Stay here, don't go away. No, no, no, no. Did you watch the last episode of Galaxy Cowboys? No, don't tell me, I'm gonna watch it today. Did you know there's a new planet? Lino, say "bye" to Manu, it's time to eat. Bye, Manu! - Bye! - Call you tomorrow. Okay. Call your mom, son. Come, mom! Not now, sweetie. I'm sitting at the edge of a boat. Is there anything to eat? You'd know if you sat down at the table with us. I'm not really hungry. You should go to therapy. You barely spend time with Lino. Do you have another son in the VR? You guys gave me the VR. Yes, to use it sometimes, not all the time. I can't look at Lino, I feel sorry for him. No, don't give me that. Lino's fine. He's fine because he's a child. But he'll grow up locked in here, his life will be miserable, Yago. Exactly, the cloud's been here since he was born, he's used to it. He won't suffer like we do. What about when we die? He's gonna be alone. He can have an online girlfriend. Oh, please. Please. Have you thought about what he'll do with our bodies when we die? - No, I haven't. - You're lying. - I haven't. - You're lying. - You have. - What, Giovana? He'll probably need to melt us. Really? Until we become a gross fluid. - Really? - Then he'll flush us! That's not important! You know why? Because we'll be dead. Of course. Lino will be emotionally stable after melting his parents. He'll get over it. What did your dad do with the nurse's body? Yago, what did he do? I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know. How is he doing? I also don't know. What do you mean, Yago? I... I stopped calling him. You stopped calling your dad? I stopped calling him because it was useless, he didn't recognize me, he wasn't listening to me anymore. What's the use, Giovana? What's happening to you? You were so thoughtful. Are you serious? You have no right to tell me that. I honestly don't understand. Sure, you can't see anything that disturbs your peace, your quietness, your perfect and pink life inside the cloud. - Stop. - You keep saying it's okay. You don't watch the news, you can't see your dad. "It's okay, Giovana." - Go to hell, Giovana! - "It's okay..." You know what? Go to hell! You have no right to tell me that. You live in a completely different world, completely different. Go back to your life inside the VR. Mom, my laptop! Sorry, sweetie. It's all wet! It'll ruin it! It's okay, I'll buy you another one, no worries. I'll have to do my math project all over again, it took me one year to do it. - What's wrong? - Everything's fine. Mom spilled water all over my laptop. Stop, Lino! Your project is still here, it's not ruined. Don't be so dramatic. Oh! Ah... What, Lino? Your project is there, the laptop is working, what is it? Lino, give me the VR back. Lino! Stop, Lino! Don't do that! Are you insane? Dammit, Lino! Holy crap! Now you have to live in the real world with us. What real world? Stop laughing! Stop laughing! Stop crying! Stop! Mom, stop! Stop crying! You have no idea what the real world looks like. I do. You don't. You live in a bubble because of this stupid cloud. I like the cloud. You like it because you're a child, you're naive. - It'll get worse, Lino. - Giovana. It only gets worse. - Giovana! - Get off me, Yago. Stop, Yago! Stop! Get off me! Stop, Yago! Stop, Yago! What are you doing? Are you gonna beat me? Stop! Give it to me. Stop, Yago! Go to hell! I hate you! You're torturing me. Your call is being redirected to voicemail... Look, mom. I made a list with a hundred reasons for you to start liking the cloud more. There are a lot. At least you may like one of them. The forth one is my favorite, I think you'll like it too. Thanks, sweetheart. Banana, chocolate, orange juice, yogurt and cereal. Yogurt and cereal. Anything else? No. All right. Giovana, you want anything? Okay. All right. And you, Lino, go to bed because you have a math test tomorrow. I've studied enough. I'm sure you did, but let's go. Can we finish watching that show about animals? The show about animals? We're not going to finish it, but we can watch one episode, okay? Yes. Okay. Give mommy a kiss. Good night, mom. Good night, sweetie. How has your day been without the VR? Okay. It's not that bad, is it? No, it's not. It's okay. It's okay. Do you want to watch TV with us upstairs? Not today. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
