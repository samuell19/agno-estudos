FIGHT FOR ROME PART II Victorious Goths of King Theodoric are chasing the Roman legions to the gates of Rome. - Rome, at last! - Future capital of the Goths, sire. No, Hildebrand. Just a garrison. Teodoric established the capital of the kingdom of the Goths in Ravenna, and for the 32 years the peace flowered but with his death the feud for the throne began Gothic people must stick together, we mustn't divide our kingdom... ...for my successor... ...I designate... Her Royal Highness, The Queen! Amalasunta and Matasunta, daughters of Theodoric competed for the crown. Amalasunta was elected and become Queen of the Goths, but as long as her sister was near she felt that her rule was threatened so, the Queen banished Matasunta to the Bolsena Island. Aspa, my sister'll pay for this, I swear! Meanwhile Rome closely observed the progress of events. Although unable to act by force, Cethegus - Rome influential patrician resourced to activities in the realm of diplomacy and the Queen proclaimed him a prefect of Rome. The Queen is the one that thinks he deserves this rank. Without asking advice of the Crown Council, first? I'll ask, when I'll need advice. You have my permission to re-establish Praetorian Guard. My Queen, it would be an armed force under the Roman command! I understand your worries and respect them. May I propose that you send someone to Rome to check on my activities? Duke of Dacia, will you undertake this task? I serve my Queen whenever she'll send me, on the battlefield, or on the streets of Rome. But Cethegus played double game, and in Byzantium together with the Empress Theodora wove plot against the Goths. It's a matter of great importance for both Rome and Byzantium. The Goths became a serious problem. Allow me to propose an alliance between us. And Rome will got all the profits, while Byzantium will got only burdens. Cethegus and Byzantine general Narses made a secret deal and Rome was not alone in the fight against the Goths. The fight for Rome will take place exclusively beetween us. My plan will only hasten the flow of events. Only the Emperor can decide about your plan. On this point, I agree with you completely. You are the real Byzantine Emperer, general. In the court of Queen of the Goths no one suspected anything. Mission to supervise the Roman activities was entrusted to Totila, and on its first day Totila accidentally made acquaintance with the daughter of Cethegus, the fiercest enemy of the Goths. Don't be afraid! Julia! Allow me to introduce you to Totila, Duke of Dacia, emissary of our Queen. I thought that nothing can beat the beauty of Rome, but now I see how very wrong was I. However, unrest among the Goths was raising, dissatisfaction with the Queen activities escalated and the Crown Council decided to take matters in their hands. We crowned the wrong Queen, she does everything what Cethegus suggests to her, she'll destroy our land. He dreams of powerful Rome, and she is helping him to realise it. - Your worlds mean treason! - No! It's the only possible salvation. Matasunta will be crowned as Queen. But Cethegus was able to make his move before the Goths Council, he gained confidence of Matasunta and allowed her to take the revenge. Matasunta prepared death in torment for her sister. Help me! Open the door! No one will help you, no matter how loud you'll scream. Cethegus is on his way to Rome. The Council learned about murder and decided to give the crown to Vitiges. Matasunta was in love with the Vitiges, but when he rejected her, her love turned to hate. Byzantium sent an army to Rome to support it in fight with the Goths and Cethegus did what exactly could be expected from him: - betrayed his Byzantine allies. He ordered his Praetorians to destroy the Rome Gothic garrison and when the Byzantine army reached the gates of Rome Cethegus didn't allowed them to get into the city. Welcome at the gates of Rome! I bring you greetings from my Emperor, we came here to deliver you from Goths. We deeply appreciate that, but the Rome is already free. The Gothic garrisson was defeated and disarmed by my army. - It's a treason, Cethegus! - I'd rather call it a circumspection. So I'll defeat the Goths myself, while you'll be hiding behind the walls like a rat. Byzantine army fought with the Goths without the Romans help and was defeated by the army of Vitiges. Through the fire! Follow me! Remains of Byzantine army took refuge in the city closely chased by the victorious Goths and only a bunch of scattered soldiers managed to get in. - Bring water! - Lift him! Welcome in Rome! You are safe here. Now we'll settle the accounts! Soldiers of Byzantium! Increase your efforts! Fight under my command, and I will avenge the dishonor, that befallen on you. Accept my command and we'll banish enemy from the gates of Rome. - Will you go with me? - Viva, Cethegus! The most difficult hour has come. A fight for Rome. FIGHT FOR ROME Part II THE BETRAYAL Dignified Emperor, you ordered to summon me? I'd like to know how are your affairs, general. You're most generous, my Emperor. Rheumatism is ruining my back... I'm not interested in your health, but in condition of my army. The one in Italy, which is at the moment under command of Cethegus, a Roman, who used it to defeat Belizarius. What wasn't our intention, Dignified Emperor. but now it's Cethegus who has to spend money on them, so we can save on that, don't we? I like to save money, Narses, but I don't like to loose the battles. If the Goths will attack again, which I'm sure will happen soon, than you'll take command of the byzantine army. Dignified Emperor we have to take advantage of Belizarius defeat and convert it to our victory. Thought it was a defeat that shouldn't happen. If I'm not mistaken it was the Empress who suggested Belizarius for a commander in that campaign. Narses! What's cooking inside that cunning brain of yours? Dignified Emperor, I am fully aware of the risk that I'm taking - and I'm not expecting graditude. - And what are you expecting? There are two possibilities: First - that the Empress couldn't outsmart Cethegus, and the second - that she didn't wanted to. In both you're in the same danger. Please allow me to check if Empress who so easy gave your army under Cethegus command will equally easy take it away from him. Your boldness is stunning, Narses. Vitiges has to make the attempt on Rome at last. Our soldiers are starting to loose patience. Have you lost your mind, Teia? How you want to force that walls? Maybe there's some other way. Rome has a sewer system. - Do you know its localisation? - It's probably where in other cities. So you don't have a plans? You were in Rome for six months but all you saw was your lover eyes. Give me a rest with Julia. - I'm trying to forget her. - And can you? No. So conquer the Rome and take her as a captive. No, I don't want to have her that way. I'll force her father to sign peace. - Give us food! - We're hungry! Citizens of Rome! - I'm asking you for some more patience! - We want food! I'm a citizen of Rome, too. Father, please allow me to go amongst people! I don't demand love from you, only a patience and loyalty. And not for me, but for Rome. I'm a loyal servant of Rome, not of its enemies! Give us bread! I won't serve the cowards! Does Rome must fall becouse you cowards have empty stomaches?! Well then. Open the city gates. Go and crawl before your enemies! They'll fill your stomaches! And then they'll run you like cattle to their camp! And they'll despise you as I despise. Go! Open the gates! Rome doesn't need you anymore! I don't like that siege takes so long. - So let's attack at last! - Cethegus still has a strong position. Romans still trust him. They can defend for a long time. Why don't we send to him a peace proposition? Cethegus is proud, but he is rational man. - Let me go! - No! No way. Rome is a too dangerous place for you, Totila. Not only for him. Charm of Rome is more dangerous than it's sword. We have only one choice: to attack. As you said, my Queen. If we don't conquer Rome now, it could be a long and hard war. So either we propose a peace or we'll attack. Let's vote! I'm for attack. - So am I. - Let's attack! - Totila? - I'm also for attack. - But you have doubts, Totila. - Thats true. I love... Rome. But I'll fight with you. So it's decided. In three days time at dawn we'll attack the Rome. We'll attack the northern gate, and at the same time we'll make diversion at the southern one. Aspa, so there's where you spend your free time. Are you longing for Rome? My mother lives there. I havn't seen her since I was a child. You'd like to visit her but you can't becouse, all of the city gates are closed. That won't be a problem - there are secret entrances. Guarded. The one of which I know is ungarded, and behind the walls is quarry from which you can enter a underground tunnel. Where does this tunnel leads? It ends near my mother house, close to her winery. Come! I think that you should go. You're giving me permission, my Queen? Do you think that your mother could lead you to Cethegus? There are no patrician houses where my mother would be unknown, and the reason for building tunnel was to allow rich men visit her unnoticed. Listen! Cethegus will recognise this ring, he will know who sends you. - From where do you got this ring? - From my Queen. I have message for you, prefect. What message? King Vitiges decided to attack Rome in three days time from northern gate, at the same time they'll attack from south, but it will be only a diversion. Why the Queen of Goths is betraying her nation and her royal husband? - Queen Matasunta hates Vitiges. - Why? My Queen shares with him only a crown, and another woman shares his bed. - What woman? A peasants daughter, with whom he was married earlier. Go back to your Queen and return her that ring with my sincere gratefulness, and tell her that she can be sure of my loyalty. Syphax! Take care that she safely returns to camp. I know the way, prefect. I was brought up ï¿½n Rome. Call the officers of the guards here. Come with me, I need to talk with you. Romans are strenghtening the northern gate, they're assembling additional defences and fetching barrels of tar, and they're deploying archers at southern gate. - I smell treason! - Strong words, Teia! Only one of us could betray, becouse only we knew the plans of attack. It wasn't anyone of us! But how prefect could learn about it? We planned attack in secret, and he can't read our thoughts. Do you have any suspects, if so speak! First I'd like to check the guards posts outside the city walls. I'd do anything to find a traitor! How did you manage to get there? Has anybody saw you? No, I have to talk with you. I need to know where could I find you later. In your tent, Totila. I'll be waiting for you there. What did you say, Julia? In my tent? I'm going with you, now. I love my father but my place is at your side. - It's impossible, Julia! - But why? Matasunta would kept you as a captive. We have to get you out of Rome, but later. Why the war have to part us? It's our fate. Escape duke, someone is watching us! We were betrayed! You have to understand that despite our frienship I can't let you go free. You're too valuable prize. Tomorrow I'll show you to citizens of Rome, this time as my prisoner, and from Rome will it'll mean your death. Take him! Let him go free! or if you don't father, I'll kill myself! Let him go! Our next meeting Totila will be your last, you can believe me! We'll see again soon. I promise. - Hey, handsome! - Come along! Yesterday Aspa was seen crossing a Tiber in a boat. She was with a man. Aspa is a beautiful girl. Right. It was me who was with her. - So we'll start tomorrow at dawn! - High time. Aligern! I have a special mission for you. Come with me! We have to enter the Rome secretly, and disguise into Romans uniforms. Come! Drag 'em over here! Come! Come on! They're also marching along the western wall, prefect. Send some reinforcements there! Attack from the south is just a diversion. Main assault will be here. But we'll have too many weak points, if we concentrate main forces only here. - Deploy Byzantines there, then. - We can't trust them. Do not worry, they hate Goths more than us. We'll welcome them with enthusiasm! They'll be suprised! At attention! Light the wicks! Soldiers! Forward! That way! Fire! Fire! Centurion, where are you taking your men? You're going in wrong direction! Are you deaf? Traitors in the city, prefect! They tried to open the eastern gate, but they were killed before they've succeeded. Open that gate, immidiately! - But, prefect... - Didn't you hear my order?! They'll think that their people opened it. We'll prepare a suprise for them! Open the gate! Gate is open! Aligern succeeded! - Follow me, soldiers! Follow me! - We were betrayed! Stop! Here! Follow me! - Get back, soldiers! Catch, you dogs! Get back! Back! Open the gate! The king is wounded! Lets carry him into the camp. What are you doing here? Who are you? Who allowed you to take care of the king? I'm not caring a king, but Vitiges, my husband. So it's you who stole him from me, and for your sake I was humiliated. I, the Queen! Get out or I'll order to whip you! You won't find anybody here who will let even the one hair of the legitime wife of the king to be touched, and please, don't talk so loud! The king is seriously wounded. A lost battle is a terrible thing for us all. Not for me. I'm delighted of it! Do you hear me Vitiges? Your defeat is my victory. I defeated you, not Cethegus! Cethegus was only a tool in my hands. Now you're a man without home. A king without crown. I'll drive you out of my kingdom like a rabid dog! - My revenge will be... - Shut up! It's all over. The king is dead. You have won, but not yet, till you live, a brave queen who killed her own king, you'll be afraid of me, and for a good reason. Becouse I'll avenge the death of my husband. You stupid peasant whore! You think that I won't manage with you? I drove Vitiges into a trap, and you I'll kill with my bare hands. He was a modest man who wanted to live for his country and for his family. He was a great king. Don't allow the Romans to take his body. No, I won't. We are departing todays night. I'd like to take him with me. Order to put him on the stretcher attached to the two horses. - As you wish, my Queen. - I'll take him home. You are smarter in love games than in waging war. That friend of yours, Cethegus became too independent. And what of Belizarius? You knew who did you take for your wife, and you even liked it. Yes, you're right. But I'm speaking about your judgement in relations with men, not about your weakness to them. Ask Narses in! He was to be a commander in that campaign, but... but you did what you wanted, and now we have results - a powerful Rome. Narses! You'll take over the command of our forces in Italy. Dignified Emperor, I'm afraid that the time isn't right yet for that. You have our permission, general, for a... withdraval. I thank you, Dignified Emperor for his favour. - Cethegus, prefect of Rome? - Yes, it's me. I'm general Herubindus. Her Royal Highness Empress Teodora expressed a wish to meet you. - It's very urgent matter. - Please give her my excuses, but our current situation makes a long trip to Bizantium quite impossible. Dignified Empress is at the moment at her summer residence, on island Helioterra, on Adriatic sea, it's not so far from Rome. A fair wind and fast ship will make this journey a pleasant excursion. Yes, a fair wind... ...that's what I need. Thank you, general. My liege, as soon as she reached her summer residence, she summonned Cethegus there. It's a dangerous game that my bishop is playing. He's playing with fire, I must say. Dignified Emperor! The Empress will receive him in that secluded place completely alone. No one could overhear them. If no one can overhear them, than why all this fuss, for Lords sake? But, my liege... It's not my business whom my wife invites for a chat, and not your either. It's not a matter of friendly chat, but a matter of a conspiracy against the state. Rome and Byzantium are friends. Cethegus isn't our friend. He wants to make the Rome the mightiest world power. Rome is still in danger, and the Goths are still it's enemies. Cethegus won't dare to plot against Byzantium, not yet. I'm in jeopardy, Cethegus. A state that is quite ordinary for you, I'd say. I fought long and hard, to become what I am. But you managed to survive. Well said. So far, yes. I know how to deal with men, with the fool and the wise,the weak and the strong - with all of them! and always they were more afraid of me than I of them. But now?! A midget is threatening me. Narses is the power that stands behind the Emperor, but his ambitions are reaching higher. He won't stop before he take over the whole rule. And what do you expect me to do, Your Highness? Kill Narses! - In suitable moment. - Now!... ...will you fulfill my wish? Please forgive me. What changed you so greatly, Cethegus? What changed us all? I'm still a woman. Who's charm I still can't forget, I wish it would be the only thing. Leave, Cethegus! I hope that fair winds will speed up your departure. Farewell, Your Highness! I want you to stand up. Here, before me! Did you write that letter? - It looks like. - So please read it to us! I ask for not to be obliged to reply in presence of the whole court. - It was my distinct wish. - Read us your letter! - It's not my letter! - Read it! It's a letter adressed to you. It's full of compliments, I adress you as the fairest of the wise. Don't you agree with that description? Dignified Emperor, I share the worlds admiration for the Empress, but that's all, besides I don't share anything with her! And if it's a conspiracy, I have nothing to do with it! A conspiracy, general? Dignified Empress we could together rule not only Byzantium but the whole world. You shouldn't share the throne with that mason and learned lawyer. You shouldn't waste your beauty at his side. My meaningless life would get a reason, if I, Narses, would give him a quick death. And the seal, my liege, look at the seal! It's also forged. I think that I have a proof for that. A proof? If I'm not mistaken in this city lives a certain Amet who's fame equals only for his lack of scruples. Does that man is known to you, Teodora? Fetch the forger here! Your Highness? Noble sirs! Your presence here is not needed anymore. Guards! - How much do you got, Amet? - Five golden pieces, Your Highness. What do you think, Narses, five golden pieces for a byzantine general? I thought that I'm worth a bit more. Five golden pieces! Right price for a forgery, but it's an insult as a price of someones head. Does she... came to you in person? Does Teodora came to you herself? Yes, my Emperor. And she gave me the gold herself. - Execute him. - No! On the spot! I havn't loved even my Lord as much as that woman. In regards to your war services, you deserve something more than only Emperors gratitude, you deserve to get some rest. That's why, the Emperor decided to take over the command of Byzantine troops stationed in Italy, and to increase theirs amount. What's the use of more Byzantines in Rome? That letter is signed by general Narses, no doubt, as evidence that we're still friends. It could be a very costly friendsip, prefect. We defeated the Goths ourselves. Byzantines came a bit too late for that. Why don't drive them back, through sea? We can't afford another war. The last already cost us too much. Citizens of Rome wants peace. Unless we manage to find another way to turn them against Byzantines. But how? Taxes, my friends! Nothing angers people more than too high taxes. We'll let the Byzantines to collect taxes, and to squeeze the people like lemons, and the Romans will repay them with escalation of hate. We don't have anything more! How we'll manage? We act on behalf of an Emperor. Hurry up, pay up! Miserable bunch! Take that and the cow too! Move along! - I've already paid! - Scram, filthy peasant! Dirty pigs! Under the Goths rule we were better! We must thank the Lord that you recovered after so many years, Atalvin. Many brave people, your father amongst them, gave their life in fights. When I learned that Vitiges was my father, I started to look for you. I want to fight along with you. You'll have a chance, soon. We are planning to strenghten our forces. Assign me some mission. I won't dissapoint you. My parents are dead, now I belong to you. We cannot lead an open fight. Totila is helping peasants to fight with byzantine tax collectors. Romans soon will cease to be our enemies. They're starting to claim openly that they'd prefer to live under the king Teodoric rule. We have to take advantage of that. I think that my Corsican lancers will arrive soon. Problem is that we don't have the money to pay them, prince Furius. We don't have riches anymore. Rome become a poor city. Rome doesn't need to pay. My lancers will maintain themselves. It's a very generous offer. What do you expect in exchange? You have a charming daughter, Cethegus. I'd like to marry her. Never and for anything I won't force her to marriage. But you can convince her. What do you propose? Three thousands of lancers and a fleet. It's a rich dowry. Speak with her yourself, prince, but don't expect too much. - Becouse she still love Totila? - It can be, Furius. Have a patience. I love my daughter as much I love the Rome, maybe even more, - but I won't allow Totila to marry her. - You're giving me hope. Thank you. - Away! - Let me go! Thank you! If not you, I'd loose my head. Keep it. Man has only a one. Who are you? A Goth - that's obvious. We hate byzantines equally as you. Won't you tell me your name? - I'd like to see your face. - No, it's not necessarry. Maybe someday you'll repay me in kind. - Let's go! - Forward! Prince Furius! It's a long time since you visited Rome. Did you forget where we live? I pay my visits only there where I'm expected. My father always welcomes you. I was not talking about your father. Today I came to see you, Julia, and I'd like to explain you why. Yesterday I was nearly killed... You fought with some rival? With a rival, Julia?! A band of bizantines marauders almost cut my head off, but luckily for me a group of Goths arrived. Their leader was very brave. He saved me. Awesome! Who was he? He didn't want to present himself. He was fair haired, medium height and expertly throw a lance. I think that I know who he was! I'd like you to be mistaken Julia, but... I thought that all Goths are in the north. No, not all. Some of them are still in the south. But, Julia... you know that Duke of Dacia is dead. But I want to ask you about something, can you imagine that... I can not talk to you any longer, but I like to know one thing. How is it that Goths are never caught? They stay hidden in the woods. They are safe there. And they're becoming stronger and stronger. Soon they will be a threat to Rome again. Thank you with all my heart! - Father! - You're so cheerful, my daughter. Yes. Prince Furius paid me a visit. He convinced me that Totila is still alive. He saved prince Furius live. Father! Why can you at least try to understand us? I'm deeply moved by your feelings, but do you expect me to jump of joy becouse my daughter wants to share her bed with a barbarian? You have no right to preach me moralities. You slept only with those women who you could exploit to your plans. Julia! You forgot yourself! I sacrified my whole life to Rome. That's why my personal feelings become unimportant to me, exept the feelings toward you, my daughter. But you don't do much to earn them. Rome, only the Rome! What is that Rome? And if you love the Rome so much why the Romans hate you? You brought on people war, suffering, hunger... Are they the proofs of your love to Rome? Under the Goths rule people were happy, content and have their stomaches full. Yes, full stomaches! Has Rome to be inhabited by fat pigs and mob? You asked me what is Rome. It's a spiritual force that created the culture which the whole world envies us. But these primitive people are trying to destroy this culture, and to force us to obedience. These primitive people of Goths. And that my daughter stands on the side of the barbarians, is completely above my understanding. Yes, I'm on their side! Those barbarians are my future and I won't let you to destroy it. I've never destroyed anything, I foresee the progress of events and I try to realize my plans according to that. Father, you can't tell me about your expectations all the time. My dear Julia, a man is either a leader or a follower. It's a choice determining his life. And if you meet somebody who thinks the same? Everybody must be aware that only one can win and all the others loose. But it mustn't always be so! Yes, it must be. There can't be a compromise here. Totila! A Roman woman entered our camp. She is not like our women. She seems to be of noble birth. - A Roman woman here? - Go and see yourself. I know who she is. It's Julia, daughter of the Prefect. Julia come to visit us! There's no reason for anxiety. Like you've never seen a Roman woman! I welcome daughter of the Prefect of Rome! I'm happy to see that rumors of your death proved to be false. - Do you bring me a message from your father? - No, duke. Please! Julia! From now I will never leave you! Can you whithstand the life we are living? In hiding? To hunt and be hunted? To live in the open? Everything! If I'd only be at your side. She couldn't escape without help from some traitors. Everybody in this city is against me. I can bear anything but no treason! I'll crucify my enemies! Your enemies or enemies of Rome? If I'm not mistaken such punishment is forbidden, already from some time, since the Constantin the Great, I think. Then I'll reintroduce it. - Mercy! - Spare us, prefect! - Don't let my son die! - He's not a traitor! - Don't be so cruel! - Have mercy! - Have mercy! - Mercy! Mercy! Every citizen of Rome must understand what punishment awaits traitors! The Goths are our enemy, and everybody uniting with enemy will be crucified! I think that this summer our hopes will be fulfilled. Teia has an army in the north... ...and I have one in the south. Almost half of my soldiers are Romans. Now even Neapol turned its back to Cethegus. Soon he will have the whole Italy against him. With the Viking fleet of king Harald at our side, we can be sure of the victory. Then we will be a one kingdom again. And we will need a king. Only one is worthy of that position. You, Hidebrand! I already declined you once, and I'm not becoming any younger. He's right. We need a young king. - You must be a king! - No it's impossible, Teia! You know that I want to marry a Roman. So maybe your sons will live in peace and don't have to fight. Become our king, Totila, and lead us to victory! So you came from Byzantium with empty hands, general? What worth are all those promises that help will arrive soon? When? Tomorrow, in a week time or maybe in a month?! Goths army is marching on Rome, and I'm alone here to defend the city. Don't worry! Totila won't dare to attack. He still remember the last defeat, even if it happened long time ago. This time a danger threathens Rome from inside. I carried a things too far in favour of Emperor and Byzantium. Citizens of Rome hates me as much as your tax collectors! General Narses offers you a command over his southern army. On one condition: He, general, will remain a commander in chief. I don't have much choice. Please tell the general that it's a honour for me to serve under his command. Goths army is powerful. I see amongst them lot of Romans - cowards who joined the enemy, a mob. I only hope that Narses army won't be too late. It won't be too late for him, but for Rome it will. But, prefect! He's our only hope. And he hopes to become the savior of Rome. We won't defend the city. Let Totila delude that he conquered Rome without a fight. Meanwhile we'll go to Narses and prepare our final victory. It'll be our suprise. Have weapons ready at hand! You still don't trust Romans, Teia? No! - Down with Cethegus! - Open the gates! Silence! What do you want? - We... - Silence! Do not let them pass! We signed the treaty with the Goths. Open the gates! Totila! Cethegus escaped to general Narses. Byzantines will attack, or my name isn't Teia! So we will defend. A Viking fleet of king Harald will arrive here soon. King Harald will keep his word, he loves Goths, Teodoric was like a father to him. It's strange how these people loves us and our country. Warm sun, always blue sky... Maybe the Vikings will stay here with us. Already want to leave us, Totila? This feast is in your honour. The king has many duties, including the ones he owes to his wife. Why there's no absolute happiness? This fight will be the last. I won't allow you to go without me. But I'll be back very soon. We'll part only for couple of days. No, we won't part at all! I'm a Queen and my place is at my husbands side. I'm going with you! You have the virtues of the both Goths and Romans, Julia: courage, love, resoluteness. So it's decided: I'm coming with you! Once you said to me that our happines will last forever. But what if that eternity will last only a couple of days. That's why I don't want to be without you even for a second. This time we will win. An our happiness will be absolute. If only I could believe that... I'm thinking about my father being relentness. That's him who must find his way to us and one day he'll find it. Even Cethegus isn't strong enough, to bear the loss of both: the Rome... ...and his belowed daughter. I need to discuss some matters with you before the battle. - Do you have a new proposition for me? - No, our old agreement is still valid, but I'd like to improve it. Maybe I'll be able to help you win this battle, I have a good plan. Follow me! I'll wear that armour tomorrow, it gives a good protection on the battlefield. I'll wear a white cloak and open helmet, and maybe a garland of roses as a symbol of victory. Don't forget that flowers are also symbol of death. You always see everything in dark colours, Teia. We will win this battle. - Stop! What do you want? - Let me pass! I want to talk with Totila. Prince Furius! Greetings, your Highness! We havn't seen each other for a long time. What brings you at the such late hour? I didn't want anybody to see me. I want to fight with my lancers on your side against byzantines. Your offer makes our victory even more inevitable. Your lancers are the best in the world. They can decide course of battle for either of the sides! You don't trust my words, count Teia? I don't trust anybody who wears sword, Furius! It's an offer from a friend. We esteem it and accept with graditude. Please sit down. I'll show you our plan of the battle, and then we'll decide where is the best to deploy your lancers. We'll fight the Byzantines in the open field. Tell me Cethegus: You came just to watch the battle or to fight in it? I came to decide of our victory. And how many soldiers have you brought with you? I'll answer that question when my forces arrive. But I gather that they are not too numerous. Those are the forces that defeated Vitiges and without which general Belisarius couldn't withstood the Goths. Byzantium hasn't forgotten that, but sometimes a reminder is neccessary. Belizarius made a grave mistake. Sooner or later everybody makes such mistake, even you or me. But your mistake is to under apreciate your allies. Your tactics of delaying havn't bringed us much benefits so far, but at the moment it partly coordinates with my plans. Tomorrow you'll conquer the Rome, and then... Yes, and then it'll remain to be seen who'll win our game. But we have to win the battle first. - Surely, you don't doubt it? - I don't have any doubts - only in concern with you. - You're very kind. Thank you. May I ask you for the last favour, as a friend? Please leave Totila... ...to me to deal with. With pleasure. Forward! Totila! Forward! Narses! Stop! Furius betrayed us. He attacked us from the back. Scoundrel! I knew it! Look - the one in white cloak is Totila. But I only want to turn his attention on me. I will pay you for that, you treachorus dog! I waited long for that moment! Come, Julia is the prize! Totila! Totila! Julia! Don't let him fall in the hands of Romans. Get the king to safety. Totila, come here! Where are you? Totila! Take a king away! I'll distract Cethegus. Totila! Don't escape, coward! Totila! Stop, you coward! You won't escape me, Totila! King Totila's fallen in battle. We need a new King. Teodoric, Vitiges and Totila, only one can became a fourth king: Count Teia. For the sword of Teodoric I ask you: Are you ready to become our king? - I'm ready! - Teia! We lost the battle, and if someone wants to surrender to the enemy he can go! I will continue fighting, but everyone who will follow me should know that it will be the last fight. King Teia is right. Yes! He's right! Teia! You won our game, Narses. Tomorrow you'll enter the Rome, and you can exploit the city like your courtesan. Yes, our game ended so early. Much earlier than I excepted. Your vanity make you a poor competitor. Yes, I said vanity. That vain and and overgrowth ambitions... ...and excessive pride. Now everything is only the matter of survival. Asking for something more would be a folly. Where others have failed and left only powder and dust there I come to sweep the dirt. In Rome we have street sweepers for it. A matter of survival was always my principle. So was the Teodora's. Very true. And where's she now? I hope that she has found satisfaction. Well, now we might give a deal of thought what would happened if it was I who had lost... ...and you were now in my place. Am I not right? General! May I ask you for a moment? I'm awaiting an answer, Cethegus. The Goths has chosen count Teia for their new king. The new king sends you the message that he'll continue fighting. Tell from me the new king of Goths that he lost his mind. A fight will mean the end for his people. Tell him that I want all Goths to leave this country. and if they leave I'll grant them a safe passage, it's my ultimate offer. Too proud to respond me! That way with the last battle on Ravine of The Goths, the tragedy of Goths, which started long ago by their migration to the south - ended. General Narses, who admired the great bravery of Goths, granted to those who surviwed a safe passage back home. They said farewell to the Italian sun and with the body of their last king went back to their northern homeland. A fleet of a Viking king Harald! They're coming to take us! THE END
