Close by, not very far away, is Villa Villekulla. It belongs to some captain, but no one lives in it now, and that's a pity, 'cause the house looks like so much fun. Sure'd be neat if someone moved in there. That would be nice. A family with girls and boys. Then we could play with 'em and have lots of fun. - Yeah. - That would be neat. In the morning, Tommy and I always have to run to get to school in time. First, we pass the shoemaker, Johnson's. And then, the bakery, where they have such yummy cookies. And then, the candy shop. It's apity we can't buy candy every day, but we don't get enough pocket money. Our little town has two policemen. The tall, skinny one in the driver's seat is kling, and the other one is klang. Our teachers told us that they uphold law and order here. And that's lucky, 'cause we've got some crooks here. Their names are Thunder-Karlsson and Bloom. Hey, such nice cops in this town, eh? If it gets to be too boring in the cooler, it's easy to break out. As soon as we get to the playground, the school is not very far. And every morning, miss prisselius is in the park. She's a kind of a play-lady for the small kids. I think she's a gossip and a pain in the neck. ♪ We are coming here from ri-a-ra ♪ ♪ ri-a-ra ri-a-ra ♪ ♪ we're coming here from ri-a-ra ♪ ♪ as-ke das-ke-da ♪ As usual, we made it to school on time. Yeah, we always do. While we were in school, something absolutely terrific happened. ♪ La-la-la ♪ A small girl with a monkey riding on a horse? Yes, and she lives all alone in the Villa Villekulla. Something like that can not be allowed. - You're right, miss. - Yes! - It just doesn't seem proper. - Yes! - We'll take care of it. - Well, take care of it. She cannot live alone in the Villa Villekulla. A girl lives in Villa Villekulla? We must go visit her right away. Look, there's a horse on the porch! Yes! - And look at that! - What's she doing? A girl can't be that strong! Oh, Tommy, that's scary. Come, let's go home. - No, Annika. I wanna see what she looks like. There she is. What's up? - We wanted to see you. - Hi. Who-who are you? My name is Pippi Longstocking. Just who are you? My name is Tommy. And I'm Annika. Say, Pippi, why do you sleep with your feet on that pillow? 'Cause that ♪ the way they sleep in Egypt, you know. Oh, look, what a cute, little monkey. He ♪ very nice. That's sir Nilsson. It's real neat at Pippi's house. We can do all the things we can't ever do at home. I don't think mama would have liked for us to play this game. Pippi calls it "don't touch the floor." And sir Nilsson is, of course, an expert at it. Oh! Miss prisselius told the police that Pippi lived all alone in Villa Villekulla, and that's not true. The monkey and the horse live with her. Pippi, have you got a mama and a papa? Yeah, I got parents. Yeah! They're just not here. But who tells you then when it's time to go to bed then? I tell myself. First, I say, quite nicely, "Pippi, go and sleep now." And when I don't obey me, I tell myself much stronger. "Pippi, you go to bed now!" And if I still don't listen, then I get a spanking, you see. So there. Come on in, or stay out. It's all the same to me. W-What? Dearest children. Dearest children, what are you doing? Playing. Good morning, my precious. Are you the little girl who just moved in? No, I'm just a gray-haired, little, old lady who moved up in the guardhouse. I've got a wild, wild room there. Guardhouse? Are you positive there's a guardhouse? Sure! Maybe someday I'll let you come up and see my guardhouse. It's quite a cozy place. Haven't you a name, my friend? My name is pippilotta viktualia... Rullgardina krusmynta... Efraimsdotter Longstocking. My papa is a cannibal king, and his name is Efraim Longstocking. Before he became a king, he was a pirate, and was the terror of the seven seas. Me they call just "Pippi." And my name is miss prysselius. I've come here to help my dearest little Pippi. Why do you wanna help me? Ah, because you don't have any parents. That's not true! I do have parents! Ah, yes, well, where are they? Mama's in heaven, and papa's in the south seas. You see? And that's why you must come with me now. I have a nice place for you. A children's home. I have a place in a children's home. Yes? Oh, you have? Where then? - That's not hard to see. Here! I have a home. - I mu... Pippi, oh, please! - Sir Nilsson! - Oh, oh, oh. He's ruining my dress! B-B-But, Pippi, you must understand that you cannot live here possibly all alone. How will you live? You don't have any money! Ah, is that so? What does this look like? Anyway, you can't live here alone. And I'll see that you don't. Adieu, you miss prissy-lissy. It was neat that you came visiting, and it's most nice you went away again. Now I know what's the matter. - Yeah. - Kling! Klang! - Yeah? You must help me. The girl is impossible. What is it? Ah, raw eggs are good for the hair. That's what I've heard. Pippi, where did you live before you came here? I didn't live anywhere at all. No, I just sailed all over the seas with my papa. Where is your papa now? I don't know. We got in a swinging storm at one time, and he was blown overboard. Here, catch it. He blew overboard? Did he drown? Oh, no, he's not drownded. He's fat, see? I think he floated to an island in the south seas, and now he's king there. Oh, then it was your father who gave you the gold coins? Of course he did, silly. Oh, look who's coming there. I think policemen are the bestest fun, next to rhubarb pie. Are you there Pippi Longstocking? Yeah, who should I be, you think? The kaiserin of abissinia, eh? See here, don't be so fresh! We're coming here because we were sent by miss prysselius. We are here to bring you to the children's home. Yeah. When the prissy-lissy wants to have a kid, she'll have to get another. No, not me! Halt there! Hear now, Pippi Longstocking. Don't be such a dumbbell. Tell that prissy-lissy I won't go! She can forget me! Now, klang, that must be handled quite differently. I'll go this way, you got that a-way. Yeah. When the prissy-lissy wants to have a kid, she'll have to get another. No, not me! After her! Hold on to her, klang! - Come on, come on! - Hold on to her. She's slippery as an eel! - Stop that mischievous child! After her! Hey, hello. Where are you going? - There she is. - Look here, Pippi. Don't be such a horrible dummy. The children's home will be so nice. Yeah, and from there, you can go to school every day with the other children. - Isn't that nice? - Silly! Why should I? So that you'll learn reading and arithmetic, multiplication, and many, many things more. Thank you. I'll do good without pluttification tables. Bye. No, klang, it's no good. We must try to catch her! - Yes, sir! Come on up. Don't be afraid! Afraid? We'll see who's afraid when I catch you! Kling, don't leave me! Careful! Careful! - Pippi. - Wait, wait. Ooh, easy! Pippi! I- can't hold on any longer! I... help me! Klang, help me! Hi! Here! - Oh-oh, there you are. - Grab her! Come on! Will you, now? Why did I have new soles put on my shoes? I keep slipping down! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Come back! Come back, I say! Now! Right now! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Oh... oh, my god. She has fallen down! How terrible. Come quick. Perhaps we can save her! Yes, the poor child. Where's the ladder? Look, klang, she's down there! What? Yes, she's alive! Come back! Pippi, bring the ladder back! Yeah, bring the ladder back! Why are you so mad at me? I thought this was such a nice game. - What are you... - the police don't play games! We'll show you what games we're playing! What, then? Why don't you come on down? Let go of the ladder now, I say, kid! You must say, "pretty please," then. Oh. Just say, "pretty please," or you can stay up there forever! Yes, well, Pippi, set the ladder back this minute, please. Good. The other should say, "pretty please," too. Yeah, I also say please! Okay, you can come down now. - That's enough! - Enough? But we just started. We've got you. No, sir. I've got you. - No, but wait a minute. - What-what? What's going on? Put us down, you monster! Stop! What are you doing? Down! Down! Run for your life, kling! Come on, Tommy and Annika! Get away from that! - Kling, start the motor! - I'm trying, I'm trying. All right, all right. Hurry up now. Come here! - There it goes. - In the car! - Step on the gas! Let's go, let's go! - I am stepping on it! - Come on, more gas. - It won't go! Well, put her in gear! , but it won't move! What's the matter with the car? - Try harder! - I'm trying! How come it's not working then? Let's go! Let's go! Hey, klang, klang! Don't go without me! Don't leave me! Come back here! Oh. No... no! Take this hat. There you go. And the coat, and the coat. This fabric will look extremely good on you, madam. It's a fantastic quality. Feel how soft it is. - Wonderful. - Yeah, really wonderful. - What does it cost per yard? - What do you want here? I'm looking for a blanket for my horse, but that stuff isn't thick enough. I need something warmer. Yes, well, for this yardage, it's 8.50 by the yard. - Oh? - Yeah. Well, I'll take, uh, two yards. And that'll be enough for a jacket also. Thank you. Pippi? Where is she, Tommy? Pippi? - Ole! What are you doing? Don't you see I'm trying on a hat? Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Come, Annika! ...in the light. Oh, please pardon. Are you the owner of this store? Oh, you must be a fine lady. And you should know how to answer all my very polite questions. You're pretty darn rude, you know? Oh, well, that's all right. Well, goodbye. At least let me shake your hand. Oh. Oh, Pippi, what should we do now? - Charge or cash? - Cash. I'll take it with me. Oh, what have you done, you naughty brat? The expensive mannequin is ruined! That's all right. I'll pay for it. Such dolls are not for sale here, and you don't have enough money. Oh, sure. Here's some gold pieces. That'll be enough, I think. - What? - And now, then, goodbye. Bye. But just look at this. ♪ Tra-la-Lee tra-la-la ♪ Pippi, couldn't we go in here? Yeah, we'll buy some bonbons. Good morning! - Good morning! - Come on, let's look around. - Good morning, children. And what would you like to have today? Eighty pounds of mixed bonbons. Eighty pounds? Oh, pounds. Are you sure, my dear? Eighty-four pounds exactly, and right now. - Eighty pounds? - Here's the money. I can pay. Oh, that's real gold, my sweet child. Of course, you can buy all you want and more. Let's get started. But 80 pounds. I must see if I have enough in the store. I'll look in the store room, all right? Could we start nibbling a little now? But of course. Eat as much as you want. Thank you. Mmm, I just love raspberries. And I like cocoa-fluffs best. I love peppermint. There were only 20 pounds in the store room. - We'll take some out here. - Oh-oh, but of course. Well, pick out anything you want. I only want raspberries, Pippi, and some gum balls, and some licorice sticks. Raspberries, gum balls, licorice sticks, and more, please. Would you mind, ma'am? Oh, my, dear me. Oh, look what she's got. Are there any kids here who don't eat candy? Come on over and try it. Here. I'd like some. Can I have this? If he can have some, I want some, too. Are there anymore kids who want some bonbons before they're all gone? That's it. Now we'll go buy medicine. - Medicine, you say. - That's it. "Medicine" is the word. And, you know, people can get sick and die, 'cause they don't buy it before they get sick. Yes, and what can I do for you today? I thought I heard someone. You sure did. I want four quarts of your best medicine. What? Hmm? I wanna have four quarts of medicine. Four quarts of medicine! What was that? What was that you're saying? Four quarts of medicine. Four quarts? Huh? But-but what kind of medicine? I'd like the kind of medicine that helps when one has gotten sick. - When one has gotten sick? - Mm-hmm. Sickness... w-well, you don t need any. What do you need the medicine for? For big blisters and such things, and warts. Oh, and it's just great for to polish with. They grow better that way. I can't understand why he gave us so many bottles. You can only really just use one like this. Can you really pour medicine in one bottle, Pippi? It can be awful dangerous like that. Ah, we won't use it. We'll just pour it out. Do you see what I see? A great toy store over there. Let's buy some. All kids who want toys, come here! Kids who want toys today, come along! Is that the one who bought the candy? Oh, hurry up! Come on. Hey, wait for me. Hey, you, come and tell me, how can she buy so many toys, that little girl? She's very rich. She's got a whole suitcase full of gold coins at home. Has she? That little girl? - Mm-hmm. - Say there, where you living? In Villa Villekulla. Would you visit my palace, okay? - I'm thirsty. - Me too. Must be because we've eaten such a lot of candy. Hey, you want some lemonade? Well, where can we get some lemonade? I'll tell you. Come with me to my tree. Don't think a tree has lemonade. Neither do I. This is it, my lemonade tree. Lemonade? I don't believe you, Pippi. That's funny. Now do you believe me? I think I have another one in here. I told you it grew pop. - Wow! One for me. Bye. Why goodbye? Hey, where did you go, Pippi? Where'd she go, Annika? I'm down here in my dark, deep pirate's cave. Oh, look, Tommy, the tree is hollow. Yeah. Hey, come on down! No, it's too scary for me way down there. But how will you ever get up again, Pippi? No, I won't get up no more ever again, and I must stay here till I'm old and gray. And you must get me lots of milk, and pie, and homemade cookies, so I can just stay alive. Tommy, Annika, come and eat! Oh-oh, we've gotta go home, Pippi, or we'll be late. Bye-bye, you two! Bye, then, Pippi. Bye-bye, and don't forget to bring me some food. Are you sure you can't get out, Pippi? Never, ever. Hey! Pippi's the best. Oh, is that so? Yeah, I just wondered if she's the right company. Sure she is. I like her lots. - Me too. - Mmm... be on your way. - Bye, now. - Bye. Don't forget, it's raining out! - We won't. - Course not. Here, dear. And don't stay too long at Pippi's house, or you'll be late for school. - We won't, mama. - We won't, mama. Oh, yeah, I have a coffee party at three today. I don't know. You could ask her to come here, then. Oh, yes, that she'd really like. Thanks, mama. Hurry up and get going, you two. - Hello, Pippi, hello! - Hi, there, Pippi! Hello! Our mama's giving a coffee party at our house. I should invite you, she said. Ooh, gosh, coffee party? I'm not sure how to behave. We'll be with you. We'll pick you up after school. Mmm, now I can see. - Hi! - Hi! What ya doing? Washing your feet, huh? Sure am. That's necessary. I can't go into a coffee party with my foots dirty, can I? Say, why do you wear such large shoes? Oh, I love wiggling my toes, and I need plenty of room. Hey, look at her! Yippee! If you want to, you could wash the floor with the water. Yeah, I always do that. That's easy. Oh, no! Oh. Oh. I've never seen anybody scrub floors like that before. Pippi, you're such a nut. I've never seen anybody scrub floors like that before. Course not. They're all stupid in school. They're all learning a lot of pluttification tables, but they can't figure anything out that's smart. Ha! Well, I thank you for having me. It was so nice of you. Attention! Company, forward march! Right arm, forward! Stretch both knees, bend! Now at ease. I was pretty nervous, so I gave myself some commands. Cause before, I wouldn't have dared come in. Ah, yeah. Yeah, that was probably best. - Yeah, was it? - Yes. Come sit with the children. Pippi, come. Pippi. Ooh, so many nice cookies. Yeah, and they look like they taste good. And these, too, and those. Pippi! Come here, Pippi! Ooh! Mrs. Johnson, look at that. Oh, my goodness. She's an impossible child. She shouldn't stick her fingers in the cake. Why not? It's tasty. Come on, ladies. Help yourselves. Wait, I'm first! Over this way, ladies. That dear child, she has neither father nor mother. Mm-hmm. My mama is an angel up in heaven, and she keeps on watching me through a peephole in the clouds. And my papa's far away, in the south seas. Pippi, I think that's enough. I'm sure your eyes are bigger than your tummy, and I don't want you to get sick. Now sit over here with Tommy and Annika, and finish what you have now. It's really fun being here. From now on, I'll always come when there's a coffee party. But, Pippi, you can't just run around and take everything, Pippi. Listen here, Annika. You got cookies and cake yet? No. Or does Tommy got cookies or cake? - No. - There, you see? At parties like this, you probably have to be very grabby. Pippi. A fine lady doesn't pick her nose like that. Well, what can a fine lady do when her nose tickles? A fine... what a lovely dress you re wearing, Mrs. Settergren. Is it new? - Oh, yes. I have it on for the first time. - Oh, the color is gorgeous. - Thank you. How does a fine lady pick her nose? What do you think's going on? Oh, benke and the other boys are chasing after poor Willie. Hey, you guys, what do you think you're doing? Get off of him, you big bunch of bullies! What was that you said? You heard me. You're almost too smart, but after I beat you, look out! You'll be a foot high. As little as you are, you mean? Why don't you try something? Hey, look at those boats. Those supposed to be shoes? Gimme one of those. I've always wanted to have a boat to use on the sea, like that, for rowin'. Just you wait, you redhead. I'm about to beat you, and that's when you're gonna start yelling for papa and mama. I'm so scared, my knees are beginning to rattle. Then why don't you just sit down? That was just the first punch, kid. What a nice start. But then comes the ending. But watch what I'm gonna do to ya. You big bully! Wow! Hey, come and help me! Help me! Wait! Just wait! Anything wrong? Who else wants to fly up that tree? Uh, gosh, i-I've gotta go home. Oh, um... Come on. Let's get out of here. If they pick on you again, Willie, you just call me, will ya? - 'Kay. The next time you pick on my friend, Willie, you're gonna have to deal with me! Okay. Oh, you showed him, Pippi. Benke's really scared now. You're a real princess! - Pippi, can't you behave now? Try to be good. - Course I will. I'll behave just like a fine lady. Oh, that lovely China! Pippi, what are we going to do with you? She should be put away! I told you! Oh-oh, what is she... a fine, gosh-awful mess I've caused for all of us. I would much rather be a sea captain. ♪ Ho-hum ♪ ♪ 15 men on a dead man s coffin ♪ ♪ yo-ho and a bottle of rum ♪ ♪ fifteen mackerel all in my coffin ♪ ♪ must have some grub in my tum-tum-tum ♪ ♪ yo-ho-ho ♪ And I tell you, the kid's lying.

His name is Thunder Karlsson. Yeah, and I'll be right there with ya. Ninety-nine... Six... Four... Five... Seventy-five... Twenty... seventeen-four... Seventeen, two... Come in... Or stay out! - Just look. - Well, I'll... aah. - Good day. - Hi! I thought it was Annika and Tommy for a minute, but I'm almost as happy to see you two. I'm very pleased to see you. Can I do something for you? No, we only wanted to know what time it is. Yeah, that's just what we wanted. Oh. Uh, Pippi, are you alone? Uh-uh, sir Nilsson is also home. Sir Nilsson? Is he in there? Uh-huh, and I'll have to get his dinner before he gets mad. Is he very strong, that sir Nilsson? Yeah, he's very big and strong, sir Nilsson. Well, we only wanted to ask you what time it is. Thanks a lot. - Yeah. Well, why don't you? - Uh, what? - Ask me. You wanted to know what a clock is, you said. Yeah, yeah, oh, what a clock is, we'd sure like to know. Well, you see, a clock is a gimmick that can say, "tick-tack-tick," "tack-tick-tack," "tick-tick-tack-tack-tick"... I don't own a clock, you know, and my time has never been awful important to me. - Eh, many thanks. - Eh, good morning. Thank you. - All the best. - Out! Uh, 'leven-ninety, twelve ninety-three... I'll tell you something, when there's such a strong guy, then the caper is too dangerous. Too dangerous! - Yeah, but at night, he's got to get some shut-eye. And then, here come Thunder Karlsson and Bloom in the night, sneak into the house, and take the gold. You can only have one more, then we're going to beddy-bye. We're in luck, Bloom. Come on. Uh-uh, d-do you think that old man, Nilsson, or whoever, is asleep? Sure, sure. Of course he's sleeping. Come on. The door was open. They have a lot of nerve. What a break. - Look there! - Only a stupid mask. There she is. She's got her feet on the pillow. What ideas these kids have. Is she sleeping? Yeah, she's sleeping. When little kids are sleeping, you can stand them on their heads and it don't bother them a bit. Ah, good. Uh, but how about that there fella, Nilsson? Sir Nilsson, if you please. Sir Nilsson's sleeping in his little red dolly bed in here. The little dolly bed? Mm-hmm. Bloom, Bloom, guess who sir Nilsson is. A monkey! Come, now, my little girl, get up. We wanna speak with ya. - No, I'm sleeping. I don't feel like getting up. - You get up this very minute. - What is it? You wanna know what time it is again, or whatever? No, no. We wanted to know if your mama and your papa are at home now. No, they're very far away. I live alone in Villa Villekulla. Why don't you tell us where the suitcase is, hmm? There, up on top of the cupboard. Oh! Oh, happy days! You won't mind that we take it with us, huh? With you? No, I don't mind at all. But you really mustn't mind that I take it back! What'd you do that for? It isn't nice to do that. Why shouldn't I when somebody wants to rob me? Wouldn't you? You started it. I didn't. Wait and see, you. Wait, I'll show you a thing or two. You can't do this to me, kid. Up, you go! Stay put, you bummin' robber. Forgive us, miss. W-We haven't eaten for so long. That's right. We-we didn't mean to be bad. We didn't want to be bad. Very hungry. Oh, me. You haven't eat yet? No, nothing. That's why we had to get the bag with the gold. If we wasn't hungry, we wouldn't have done it. That's right. We-we're really very hungry. Yeah. Oh, that's really a terrible shame. I just have a little cream cake at home. Would you like some of it? Cream cake. Did you hear that? Yeah, that would be a nice bit. Th-that would be yummy! I'll go get it. - Grab the bag. - Yeah. Come on. Come on. Halt! Are you crazy? Why did you ruin this nice cake? What a disaster! You got all the cake that I've got. W-Wait. Come, Bloom. [We'll see you later, indistinct]. Yeah. Isn't that something? Such mean guys. First, they come and make believe they're ready to starve to death, and then they try to steal. But maybe they really were hungry. They looked hungry. See there, mama, I wanted to give them a gold piece. But, mama, you saw they just ran away. Breakfast time, little old man. Sir Nilsson and I are almost through. Take your pick. There's enough of everything. And now, I'll show you something beautiful. I found it in the closet last night. Just you wait and see. Did you say you wanted to take a closer look? I'm sure it's something for curious mousy. Keep your beady, little eyes wide open, but don't get scared. You wanna know what it is? But you can't see. A flower, from Japan. The name? I don't know. I forgot. Let's make up a new name for it. Yoko-hama-shippa? Or shling-shlang-shlung? Or shpunk. Shpunk. Shpunk. What do you think, little mousie? I think "spunk" has such a nice sound to it. Spunk. Spunk. I don't know what it means, mama, but it's such a lovely word. Spunk... spunk... - Hi, Pippi! - Spunk... spunk... - Hi, hello, Pippi. - Spunk... spunk... - What you talking about? - Are you ill or what's wrong? - Spunk. Steady, now. I just invented something. - What have you invented? - A nice new word. - What kind of word? - Say it again. Spunk! Spunk. Word. Not even a professor could invent it. Spunk. But what if spunk would be something dangerous? What? Something dangerous? A wild stork with sharp claws! A terrible creature, you know, who eats kids and little monkeys! - Nah. - Nah? You wouldn't be that sure when one came up and bit ya. A spunk trap would be good, wouldn't it? Now we'll be able to leave sir Nilsson alone. As soon as the spunk opens the door, pang! Right on his noggin. But how will we be able to get back into the house then? That's not hard. We climb through the window. Now we can leave Nilsson alone, and take a trip on the float. And Nilsson will be safe, so we don't have to worry about him. ♪ Spunk ♪ Spunk. Spunk! Don't you think that sounds like a spunk, Pippi? Oh, no, Annika. I hear just... Spunk. Spunk. Spunk! Spunk. And what is such a spunk? Sp-u-u-u-unk. Sp-u-u-u-unk. Do you think we'll find a spunk? Oh, s-u-u-ure! There's spunks all over, so let's go find one. A spunk? Well, I'm not sure we have it. Are you sure you've looked for one here in the store room? Hmm, yes. Spunk, spunk, hmm? Spunk. S... you sure you want a spunk in this here store? Yeah, sure, spunk, and I don't mean a spoonk. Or didn't I say that? Oh, yeah, you did say "spunk," all right. Now, let's take a look in here, and see what we've got there on the 's'. Yeah, there it is. We got straps, and salt shakers, strainers, spirals, and spool vanes, and who knows what... hmm, no. No, we don't seem to have that there spunk. I wanna scare lions with it. The stinkers are so fresh, ya know. Oh, you're too much. How about this? This good for chasin' lions. But that's no spunk. That's just an old rake. Ask a professor, if you don't believe me. Well, you might try the yard store just 'round the corner. Now, they might have just what you re looking for, little girl. Thanks a lot. Bye, then. It was nothin'". Goodbye, now. I'll take two jump ropes. Hey, they cost... hey, hold on here! Thank you. Annika, doesn't prissy-lissy live up there? Maybe she's got a spunk. I'll ask her. It is a scandal. That's what I think. But people's morals are so bad nowadays. - Uh-huh. - Yes, yes. Have a little, won't you? - Thank you, dear. - And you? Thank you. Hello in there! Pippi! I'm looking for a spunk. Have you seen one around here? Spunk? Is that something dangerous? Oh, yeah, a spunk is dangerous. W-w-w-what is it then? How can I know? It could be a snake, and a short little mousie, and a blue... or a gorilla. What nonsense! Have you gone mad, you child? No, I just wanted to make quite sure you weren't talking a lotta spunk about people in town. So long! Goodbye! Oh, my god, Pippi! I wonder if she's killed herself! By now, she's killed herself! My spunk hurts. Let's go to the doctor. Pippi is just making a nervous wreck out of me! Oh, yes, I understand. Now, let me see. I'll get something here, and, uh, good. You're probably very good at sticking out your tongue, hmm? - Mmm. Now let me have an "aah." - Ah-ah-ah. - A nice long "aah." A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a ah. Thank you. That's enough. And now, could you open your dress, and I'll listen to your little heart. - Does it beat? - Yes, of course it beats. It's quite normal, my dear. But I'm sure I've got a spunk, doctor. Is it very catching? No, it's not catching. And I'm sure you don't have a spunk now. Tell me if there's a sickness like special spunk, and if it'll go. - Nah, I'll tell you. You, my friend, will never get such an illness, even if there was something like it. That's swell! Then I'm okay again? - Yes, you are. - How much does it cost? Nothing. Spunk examinations are always free. Oh, hey, that's nice of you. Thanks a lot! - Oh, you're welcome. - Bye, doctor. - Goodbye. Pippi! Pippi! Oh, there must be spunk caught in there. Oh-oh, I'm all wet! Oh! Pippi! No, that was not the spunk. That was only that prissy-lissy. ♪ Oh golden coins I love you ♪ ♪ la-la ♪ ♪ right in me pocket now ♪ Oh, so you've turned into musicians, hey? How did you like the cream cake? Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah. Scram. Have you stopped thieving, or have you found a new way to cheat? Get lost! Scram! Here, have a couple'a gold coins, 'cause you sing so good off-key. Just think.

Yeah, but she's awful strong. But-but, she ain't gonna be there next time we grab a hold of the suitcase. ♪ Golden coins ♪ It would be nice to fly like that. Pippi can fly just like a bird. And she landed right on her bottom, you know. The balloon! The balloon's still here. - What kinda balloon, Pippi? - Papa's balloon, you know, and it's up in the attic! Oh, come on, Tommy! Come on. Let ♪ go get it! We can go for a trip in it. - What color is it? - What are you talking about? - What if she's at home? - Shh-shh. A horse on the veranda. Come on, now. Come on. Let's go. - Nice horsie. The balloon was built by papa. He wanted to visit the polar bears. How far'd he get? The attic. Oh, it was that stupid monkey, Nilsson. Sir Nilsson, you mean. Now, where is that suitcase? Where can it be? Bloom... There it is! We've got it... shh! - Ooh! Pippi, wanna take some food along? Sure. Make some sandwiches. - Let's go. - I'll fix the balloon, and you get the pole with the hook on it. Fantastic, Thunder-Karlsson! That's how you grab a bag! Ah, we made it! We made it! Annika, fix me two cheese sandwiches, and a small one with ham, okay? Hurry up or we won't get far today. Am. I can't go any faster! Put the pole down and help Annika carry the food. I'll get some more sandbags. Let's get going. - Yeah! Bye, old man! Be good now. Be seeing you, Villa Villekulla! - Hi, mama! - We're up here! - Hi! - All the way up here, mama! - All the way up here! - Yeah, but, uh... we're on our way to the north pole! Sure. We'll catch the crooks, Thunder-Karlsson and Bloom. We'll give them a run for their money, you know. Well, I certainly hope you catch them soon. I have to insist that they be put in prison, at once! - Yes, that's right. - That's right. Now, we have our speedy motorcycle. - For sure. - That's good. Hi! Oh-oh! Oh, yay, she was easy to scare.

Hurry! 1 never knew what fun it is to fly in a balloon, Pippi. Neither did I. Oh, dear me, look how small they look. Look there. That's kling and klang. Stop! You must come down! This is. Come down, in the name of the law! Pippi Longstockings, come down! - What did you say? - Down, now! I can't hear you! You must speak louder! You wanna come flying, too? Pippi, I heard what they wanted. We must come down at once, or we'll probably get a spanking. If they want us, let 'em come up and get us. - Tell her. - Come down! Just wait till we catch you! I said, now! Come down this instant! Dd catch it now, sir Nilsson. We'll fly along the coast, Annika, and we'll land somewhere along here. Oh, please, Pippi, not in the water. No, we'll find a real neat place. Ninety-nine, a thousand, a-thousand and one, a-thousand and two, a-thousand and three, a-thousand and four, a-thousand and... oh, we're rich. We're rich! - Yeah, you said it. I wonder what little Pippi will say now! Oops! Where'd she come from, that thing there? Pippi. The spittin' image of Pippi. There's something fishy about this, and the suitcase, and the gold! Are you scared of a stupid doll? I can't believe it. Halt! Oh, no, what are we going to do now? Would you move those cows out? - Move! - Move, move! Go, go, go, go! We have to get them out of the way here! Get out of the way!! Get out of the way, little sheeps! We wanna land. Pull on the line there, Tommy, and let out some gas. Move over, little lamby-pie. Put the bottles on that tree stump. Okay. They must have landed behind the trees. To the left. - No, no, no, right! - To the left! - Over there behind... oh, there, the policemen! Go there! Come on, kling. We're gonna get them before they can get away! Ah, this time, we're going to get you, Pippi Longstockings! You wanna come and fly with us? Stay down! Stay down! Hey, come down!

It's not far now. Yes, Pippi, you're almost here! Come on. Super! Good, Pippi! - Pastor, pastor. - Yes, what is it? Is there a fire? - No, no, but, uh... no fire, but, uh, children in the church spire. Three of 'em. - The church-the church spire? Children? Triplets? I saw that they re sitting in a balloon. - Balloon? - Yes. Have you been at the bottle again? Oh, never. Oh-oh, never. Come and see for yourself, sir. I don't see any children. Such nonsense! But it was here. B-But I did see them! You must never stray from the narrow path, my dear fellow. You know, it's time, my dear custodian, to stop the drinking. Oh, please, sir. I'll never have another one again, sir. Never again. - That's all right. There's someone. Stop here! - Okay. - Hey! Have you seen three children flying by in an air balloon? Ab-b-balloon? Do you think I saw them? He must be drunk. Drive on, kling. C-C-Come back! I did see the children in the balloon! I did see them! Tell the pastor I'm not crazy, please! Come back!

Resisting an officer is illegal! Bye-bye! And my clothes all have to all be dry-cleaned. - Oh, what a shame. - And, luckily, all the spots came out. Pity, isn't it? Yes, indeed, I feel so sorry for the poor child. Oh, Mrs. Settergren asked if I wanted to take care of Tommy and Annika, and I wouldn't take the time if I didn't care for those children so very much, you know? Now, children, let's have a pleasant dinner together. It's time little Pippi saw how nice a real home can be. I already know that, you know. I really have two homes. One in Villa Villekulla and one on the corredot island. Ooh, that's hot. Yeah, it's boiling all right. It will do you good to eat hot soup today, right? Mmm. Let's eat hearty now. That soup is awful warm, but it's very good. But... I think you should have cooked the carrots more. Never mind, Pippi. Just eat your soup. Oh, I don't mind in the leastest. I got good, strong choppers, just like my granny. She loved to munch on nails and spikes. Because she never ate candy, you know. So she said. But, ooh, Pippi, what sort of things did your grandmother eat? Nails. Just nothing but nails. Keep your fingers crossed that my letter arrives safely. Where will it arrive, Pippi? Where my papa lives, of course. You really think the bottle will swim that far anyway? Course it will. Oh, Tommy, I'm longing for papa and mama. They've been gone so long. Don't you think I long, too? You, too? Yeah, my mama's up in heaven, so I can't send her a bottle letter. But papa... I hope he comes soon. Pippi! My little girl! Papa! My papa! Ooh, I love you so much! Papa, mmm! I'm so glad to see you. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Papa Efraim, you've grown a lot! Pippilotta, Victualia Draperia Pepperminta. Oh, my, how you must have missed your father. My little Longstocking, my dearest little sparrow. And look at you, my, how you have grown! Yeah, I've eaten nails, just like granny. Tell me, are you as strong as you used to be? Much stronger. Wanna see how much? Sure. Come on. You're sure stronger than you, pippilotta... than you were last time. Unbelievable, the strength you have. I was always the strongest. I'll be 10 next year, and then I'll beat ya up, papa Efraim. But I forgot to properly present the kids next door. Tommy and Annika. Pleased to meet you. Good evening. And that's my father. His majesty king Efraim Longstocking. - Mm-hmm... Annika. - Pleased to meet you. - Tommy. - Good to meet you, sir. Papa, you are a king on a south sea island?? Yes, of course. Corredot people, on the corredot island. That's where I am king. You remember when I fell overboard. I floated ashore on the corredot island, you know. I was very quite sure that you hadn't drownded. Drown! Not me. That's impossible. With all my fat, I just floated. Ah, come to me, Pippi. When we go sailing again, you will sail with me, Pippi. Yeah. What's the matter, Annika? Annika. Tommy, I'm so sad. How come? Pippi's going away with her papa, and she won't come here again. She might never, ever come back again. Wake up, papa! Wake up! Breakfast is ready, it's on the kitchen table! Aah. Aah. Now, when I'm a princess, is it okay if I fib? Oh, yeah, that's right. At night, we'd really spin some tall tales, pippilotta. I've told such stories that all the corredots beat their Tom-Toms. How's your storytelling going? When I make up my stories, no one Tom-Toms for me. A couple of nights ago, I made up a story about a chicken that knitted sweaters, and climbed trees, and you know what? I believed every word of it. Wasn't that something? But I still didn't hear no one playing the Tom-Toms for me. Pippi! Prissy-lissy. Hurry up and hide! Come on, hurry up! Why did you run away from me? Pippi, I simply have to have a serious word with you, right now. - Is that so? This can't go on. You will have to go and stay in the children's home, before you completely ruin Tommy and Annika, with your balloon flights, and your-and your... - shh. Now, listen to me. How do you expect always to have all your own way, when you don't have parents? Miss priss, I got a papa who's a fine man, and he's a captain. What do you have to say to that, huh? Now you're lying again. Where is he? Here. Under me, in the chest. That is not very funny. You don't think my papa's here? No. You don't think that's right? Or that your papa's come here. Or that your papa's come here. You don't? Is that your papa? So, that's your papa. Well, little Pippi, then everything is all right. Yes, miss, everything is all right. No children's home for Pippi. Well, of course not. She has a nice papa. It pleases me, really, captain. Come on out, mousie. Help me. - Think it's such a shame that you're going to such a far off place in the south sea islands, with your darling little daughter. Oh, we will miss her so very, very much. Wouldn't it be much nicer if you stayed here, captain? - Hurry up, mousie. - And then you could both lead a normal life. Won't you do that, captain? Oh, no, that's not for an old seafarer. Oh-oh, that's not so. A seafarer, yes, but not old, captain. - Take a look at your feet. A mouse! I've got 500 more here. Right in there. Oh, no! Don't let them out! I can't stand them! Oh, oh! Help, help! Pippi. Oh, Pippi. Oh, a mouse. Ahoy, Pippi! Ahoy! Ahoy! - Ahoy, captain! There he comes, the captain and his daughter! Hey, Pippi Longstocking! She got a friend. Pippi Longstocking! There she is! Welcome, welcome! The princess. Oh, look who's coming! - On board, here we go! - Good to see ya. Good to see ya. - Come aboard! Hi! Oh! - Hi! - Here, catch! Be careful there, mates. Be careful. Attention! You're all invited to a feast in Villa Villekulla, this afternoon! And we'll all have a great... ooh! You see that? I got you now! - Tommy, Annika! - What is it? - Yes? - We gotta hurry. The crew from the "hoppetossa" will be here any minute! I'm going as fast as I can. We need one more barrel with lemonade. - I got it handled. - Hey! Hey, let somebody else have some, too. Is that all the glasses and cups we have, Annika? No, Pippi. We've got lots more. Yeah, we gotta use all we have, 'cause all the kids in town are coming, too. Don't worry. There'll be more than enough for everybody. I'll go and get the big cake I fixed. - Want me to help you? - No, thanks. If I can lift a horse, I shouldn't have any trouble with an itty-bitty cake. Mmm. Mmm. - Careful. I think I hear them coming. Hey, Pippi Longstocking! We're here! There's a boat on top of it! Come on, everybody! Come on! This is the place! Welcome, all! Ahoy, Pippi! Hey, Pippi. Is everybody ready to eat? - That's what I want to hear. - Come on, here we go! Attention! Ready, go! Come on, come on. Let's go. Remember, the one who eats the most gets the prize! Oh, boy! Good cake. Wait till I tell my mom. I'm so thirsty. ...pink lemonade, too. Here, old man, you have some, too. Good stuff. Hey, what's the strongest to drink around here? A creamy cannibal king!

Stay here, Pippi, please. But, papa... I wanna be with him. But Pippi, when are you leaving? I think the "hoppetossa" casts off at ten. It's not impossible that I could die from sadness, is it??

I have some coins in my apron. You know what? I won't need any on the ship, now when I'm going away. Come, I have to get down to the ship. I'll hang the key here so you can visit when I'm gone. No, when you're gone, we won't come here. Absolutely not. Never. Come, my little old man. You don't wanna stay on the veranda, do you? Come along. Farewell, Villa Villekulla! You've been nice and leak-free, comfy and warm. Hope the straw huts on the island don't leak too much. - Hello, Pippi, ahoy! - Ahoy, papa! What shall I do with the horse?
