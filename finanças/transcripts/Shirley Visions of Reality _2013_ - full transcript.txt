Voilà Mademoiselle, votre chambre. Merci Monsieur. Bonne nuit. Bonne nuit, Mademoiselle. Mhh... these lights... at least from a French hotel expect something a bit better. I couldn't imagine Paris, now I can't even imagine Greenwich Village. Another week here, another week on the sea, then back home to New York. Maybe the trip across the ocean will help me get adjusted again. Where is that program? S.S. De Grasse. Commandant Jules Chabot. De 8 heures 45 à 9 heures 45 au Grand Salon. Concert sous la direction de M. - ah... Monsieur David, Violoniste. Vendredi, 11 septembre 1931. Programme: Martha. Ouverture. Flotow. Romance en Fa Tchaikovsky. Danse Norvégienne No 3. Grieg. La Navarraise. Massenet. At 10 p.m in the Salon de Thé: Dancing. How strange? The dancing is in English. Se glisser dans ton ombre à la faveur de la nuit. Suivre tes pas, ton ombre à la fenêtre. Cette ombre à la fenêtre c'est toi, ce n'est pas une autre... ...c'est toi... N'ouvre pas cette fenêtre. ...mhh... Ferme les yeux. The Group Theatre, which has been rehearsing through the Summer at Dover Furnace, New York, feels that its first production of the season will be ready for local showing about the third week in September. ROME: Benito Mussolini has come to the conclusion that neither the existing 'Marcia Reale' nor the Fascist fighting song 'Giovinezza' is good enough to be counted as the Italian national hymn. NEW YORK: An estimated 25000 theater-goers, actors, directors, stagehands, the majority in New York, are displaced by the effects of the depression. I don't want to hurt him but I just need to work and live together with the Group Theater. If we have a relationship off-stage, wouldn't that be reflected in our work? Sunday night. People are still going out, enjoying themselves in cinemas, theaters. But how could I go to the movies tonight? To see 'Scarface'. I am scared enough of reality as it is. Should I feel guilty? Weekends don't exist for journalists. He even worked today. How does he manage to enjoy himself, being confronted day after day with the most horrible stories based on other peoples fate? People, like our neighbor. Every morning he leaves the house with his briefcase pretending to go to work as usual. And then I see him standing in one of those bread lines waiting for leftover food in his grey suit, his tie removed. Theater should deal with the tragedy of daily life. Not the other way round. It's not because of him that I am moving out. DANZIG: All preparations for Danzig's defense have been completed, and the city is now awaiting events, tense but calm, despite the fact that almost all believe war between Poland and Germany is imminent. PARIS: It is not the British Cabinet alone that will sit today to decide the answer to Chancellor Hitler. NEW YORK: Cooling northeast winds brought relief to the city yesterday after twenty-seven days of high temperatures and high humidity. Get outta here! Before I crack your face again. I'd kill a guy for looking at me that way you are now. Yeah, you killed, all right? You're a murderer! You're a butcher, sure. Why don't you let me forget you? Ain't I got troubles enough with the cops and newspapers bothering me and Johnny and Martha? What's the matter with them? None of your business! Just leave us alone you never brought nothing but trouble! Just stay away and leave us alone and die! But leave us alone! I prefer the role of an usherette. Hollywood films with social content how perverse! $165,000 for the film rights, paid right after Samuel Goldwyn saw Sydney Kingsley's 'Dead End' at the Belasco Theater. Eleanor Roosevelt came to see us three times. She even made it the first command performance in the White House presented at the request of the president. Stars, stars, stars. Hollywood is a dead end. Everybody comes back. Like Clifford, after 'Waiting for Lefty' and 'Awake and Sing!' Hollywood offered $4,000 a week. He resisted at first but then. 'Paradise Lost' ran into trouble at the box office so he went. A communist in Hollywood. A screenwriter doesn't have to sacrifice art and ideas for his work. People can be given a sense of problems, a heightened perception of life, and at the same time be entertained and even gripped. Nonsense! Hollywood corrupts people. Good thing he came back. 'Golden Boy' was back to the roots... and successful. But now it starts again. Two failures and financial problems are enough, and then the cohesiveness of the group begins to crumble. Hollywood is calling again... or even worse... we are calling Hollywood: Please send some more stars... send Silvia Sidney. We need her to enhance box office appeal. Where are the fundamental ideals? I had to leave the group. I prefer the role of an usherette. No, don't! What's the matter? I ain't good enough for you? Oh no, it ain't that. You know Frenchie, I never forgot you. Go on, you and all your fancy dames, where do I come up? They don't mean nothing. - Of course, what's her name? Nothing, she ain't got nothing. None of them have! Remember that night on the roof? Yeah, I remember. Sky was full of stars and I was full of dreamy ideas. Yeah, me too. What a couple of crazy kids we were we were gonna get married! I bought a ring. I didn't have enough money to buy the license. Remember? It seems like yesterday. We were talking about it right here. Yesterday seems like a million years. The United States Army transport American Legion is scheduled to dock at the Army Base in South Brooklyn at 1 p.m. today, carrying 897 refugees from the war zones of Europe. MEXICO CITY: Leon Trotsky's body was reduced to ashes yesterday afternoon in the crematorium attached to the Panteon civil cemetery. LONDON: Heavy German raids on various objectives in England were carried on with hardly a pause into yesterdays night. London suffered its most prolonged attack of the war. She's gone for a snack and a drink with her boss. Right now they were sitting in this bar on the corner of Broadway and 52nd street, talking to the polish barkeeper. The subject was - as always and everywhere in those days - the war in Europe. Already a year ago the invasion of Poland, when the New York World's Fair reopened this spring, the Polish and Czech pavilions were gone. And on the 25th of June the flag of the French pavilion was flying at half-mast. Paris had fallen into the hands of Hitler. Wiener Blut Vienna Blood this time will have taken on another meaning since the start of the war and now music from the occupied city of Paris. Music from a better time. That's her boss, they just returned from the Bar. She's in the bathroom reapplying her lipstick, getting ready for the next scene as the secretary in this play. Newspapers never sleep! Steve has been telling me this for the last ten years. Good thing they put me in the advertising department so I don't have to deal with any kind of crime story or social drama. I simply get too emotional a result of the method acting, I guess. We even took the jobs of the protagonists of our plays - to study their real experiences, to get into their moods and emotions. And now here in this office, working as a secretary, I feel like I am preparing for a new role. LONDON: It was disclosed today that secret new anti-aircraft guns will meet any large-scale resumption of German air attacks against Britain this winter. WASHINGTON: The American people may be asked to observe one meatless day a week in the near future, to save shipping space needed for the movement of war weapons to fighting fronts, President Roosevelt said today. MOSCOW: While General Gregory K. Zhukoff's offensive west of Moscow continued to meet with success, the grim battle for Stalingrad grew in ferocity. Good evening, Madame! Good evening! Good evening! Good evening, Sir! Could you please call a taxi? Yes Sir! Good evening! To the theater? Good evening! Yes, to the Shubert Theatre. Hello, New Haven Hotel. A taxi please to the Theatre! Yes, Shubert Theatre. Thank you! It will come soon, Sir. Thank you. It will be here soon - hopefully! Excelsior, New Jersey: The home of Mr. Georg Antrobus - the inventor of the wheel. Excelsior, New Jersey: The home of Mr. Georg Antrobus - the inventor of the wheel. This is his home. A commodious seven-room house, conveniently situated near a public school, a Methodist church, and a firehouse; It is right handy to A and P... This is his home, a commodious seven-room house, conveniently situated near a public school, a Methodist church, and a firehouse; It is right handy to A and P... Mr. Antrobus himself. He comes of very old stock and has made his way up from next to nothing. Mr. Antrobus is a veteran of foreign wars, and bears a number of scars, front and back. Mr. Antrobus is a veteran of foreign wars, and bears a number of scars, front and back. This is Mrs. Antrobus - the charming and gracious president of the Excelsior Mothers' Club. Mrs. Antrobus is an excellent needle woman; It is she who invented the apron on which so many interesting changes have been rung since ...so many interesting changes have been rung... rung. You shouldn't stare at her legs, it's embarrassing. I was looking for the taxi! So many interesting changes have been rung since... Oh, oh, oh! Six o'clock and the master not home yet. Pray God nothing serious has happened to him crossing the Hudson River. The fact is, I don't know what'll become of us. Here it is the middle of August and the coldest day of the year. It's simply freezing; The dogs are sticking to the sidewalks - can nobody explain that? No! But I'm not surprised. The whole world is at sixes and sevens, and why the house hasn't fallen down around? And why the house hasn't fallen down about our... ...and why the house hasn't fallen down about our ears long ago, is a miracle to me! You should be ashamed at your age! I didn't do anything to be ashamed of! In the midst of life, we are in the midst of death - a truer word has never been spoken! Mrs. and Mr. Antrobus are just opposite, waiting for a taxi to take them to the theater... the theater, where I'm gonna play their maid Sabina, in two months time! We'll miss the beginning. I don't know why the woman is wearing a fur? Mhh... we've plenty of time. It's the end of August... But I had to hurry! But it suits the text of the play and I can hear the Dinosaur and the Mammoth. We've managed to survive for some time now... catch as catch can... the fat and the lean. And if the dinosaurs don't trample us to death, and if the grasshoppers don't eat up our garden, we'll all live to see better days. Knock on wood! Here it is. Let's go! We've rattled along, hot and cold for some time now. And my advice to you is not to inquire into why or whither. But just enjoy your ice-cream while it's on your plate! That's my philosophy. Senator Richard M. Nixon, Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, released today details of a September campaign tour that will take him into sixteen states. WASHINGTON: The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee released a report yesterday, charging that the Radio Writers Guild is dominated by a small number of communists. SEOUL: Navy planes hurled heavy attacks at Communist power plants in northeast Korea Wednesday, while Air Force Superforts and light bombers followed at night with three hammer blows in the west. Should I seek professional help? Steve says so. No sleep all night. But I know the reason anyway; Judith was chasing the fire inspector down Commerce Street with a bamboo spear from the theatre. He closed the shows. He insisted that Julian's sets are dangerously flammable. Hm... Nonsense! The closing of 'The Heroes' and 'Ubu Roi' is just an attempt to contain us... The Living Theatres' bohemian influence, the un-American activities virus - spreading across the country, infecting people, threatening them, forcing them to confess to betray colleagues. Who'll be the next to name names? It's horrible to suspect close friends as informers! But who would have dared to think of Gadge? Elia Kazan as a rat? And then he took out an ad in the New York Times to defend himself and to encourage others to do the same! I think it is useful that certain of us had this kind of experience with the Communists, for if we had not we should not know them so well. Firsthand experience of dictatorship and thought control left me with an abiding hatred of these. It left me with an abiding hatred of Communist philosophy and methods and the conviction that these must be resisted always! The motion pictures I have made and the plays I have chosen to direct represent my convictions. Elia Kazan... Was this the same man who played the taxi driver in 'Waiting for Lefty'? Who held up his fist at the end and yelled 'Strike!' As the audience yelled 'Strike!' right back at him? Was this the same man who directed 'The Skin of Our Teeth' with me as Sabina in New Haven, 10 years ago? Or the man who had a hard-won reputation for actual caring about the social content of his work? Who even in his Hollywood films tackeled difficult issues like discrimination and revolution? And now the closing of the Cherry Lane Theatre. It's too much! We had such great performances... Hmm... John Cage... Where are we going to play in the future? In the streets? That's all we do - always beginning again! Over and over! President Eisenhower ended a four-day golfing idyll by the Pacific and returned to the White House and politics today. NEW YORK: The first national convention of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. since 1950 is to be held in this city next Feb. 9th to the 12th. BONN: The West German and United States Governments have concluded a payments agreement to cover orders for heavy armaments from manufacturers in the United States. Although I knew the surroundings so well; The park, the trees, the houses, the people - I somehow felt isolated from it! As if I was looking into a diorama at the Museum of Natural History. The one with the bisons and the painted background landscape of Montana... We've never talked about it, but I think we felt the same. As a photographer he must have been used to this more than me. I didn't know then that soon we'd never be able to share these moments again: These morning rituals... looking out watching together in silence. I didn't know then that I would have to talk in the future to put into words what I was seeing... to link my eyes with my brain and my tongue. But as soon as I would name what I was seeing it would change. Seeing was never the same again; Our ritual always ended with the news - back to reality. And the latest news from Hollywood: Elvis Presley who has signed a contract with Paramount Pictures earlier this year, has just started shooting his first movie on loan-out from Paramount to Twentieth Century Fox. It is reported to be a Western entitled 'The Reno Brothers' Here is the original version of his number one hit 'Hound Dog' by Big Mamma Thornton. NASHVILLE: A campaign to intimidate the Negroes who enrolled their children in white schools began here today. HAVANA: Dr. Santiago Rey, Cuban Minister of the Interior, lifted censorship today on all publications in English entering Cuba from the United States. NEW YORK: Today's new film is '3:10 to Yuma', a Columbia Western Drama; Starring Glenn Ford, Van Heflin and Felicia Farr, at the Astor. OK, this looks good Shirley! We'll get started! Turn around and look out the window. And turn your head and look at me. Now, sit down on the bed yeah... and look out of window! All right! Look at the door... and... look at me. It was the first time Steve had asked me to pose for him. And it was again the first time I could observe him working behind the camera. It seems strange after knowing each other for such a long time. Turn your body towards me and put your hand on the bed. But it simply never happened before and it would never happen again. He became a stranger to me at that moment as I might have been for him as well a woman he wanted to behave and look like the woman he imagined for his photograph. I have experienced this a hundred times before with various stage directors. But with Steve it was different tense... almost erotic... To be treated by the closest person in your life like a stranger in order to become somebody else - somebody I created, according to his imagination for him. Three dock workers charged with the theft of two Cinemascope valued at $3,500 each from a Brooklyn pier were arraigned in Brooklyn Felony Court yesterday before Magistrate George Rader. LONDON: Two British scientists have reported the surgical removal and successful regrowth of lenses in the eyes of rabbits. NEW YORK: Don't knock the spell of illusion. That's what Sweden's Ingmar Bergman says in the latest of his highly esoteric and technically exquisite films. 'The Magician'. It opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday. Imagine prisoners who have been chained since childhood deep inside a cave. Not only are their limbs immobilized by chains, their heads are as well; So their eyes are fixed on a wall. Chained since childhood deep inside a cave. Behind the prisoners is an enormous fire. And between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way along which men carry shapes of various animals, plants, and other things. The shapes cast shadows on the wall, which occupy the prisoners' attention. Also, when one of the shape-carriers speaks, an echo against the wall causes the prisoners to believe that the words come from the shadows. The prisoners engage in what appears to us to be a game. A game, naming the shapes as they come by. This, however, is the only reality that they know, even though they are seeing merely shadows of images. Suppose a prisoner is released and compelled to stand up and turn around his eyes will be blinded by the firelight, and the shapes passing will appear less real than their shadows. Similarly, if he is dragged up out of the cave into the sunlight, his eyes will be so blinded that he will not be able to see anything. At first, he will be able to see darker shapes, such as shadows, and only later brighter and brighter objects. The last object he would be able to see is the sun which, in time, he would learn to see as that: This is that provides the seasons and the courses of the year and presides over all things in the visible region, and is in some sort the cause of all these things that they had seen. The last object he will be able to see is the sun. NEW YORK: Mayor Wagner and his supporters for his renomination campaigned yesterday through the decaying slums and fresh housing projects of the Lower East Side. HYANNIS' PORT: President Kennedy spent a quiet holiday on Cape Cod today. HAVANA: Industry minister Ernesto Guevara said today's shortages of raw materials and spare parts have forced factories in Cuba to halt production. He blamed aggression of imperialism for the. Good morning, doctor! Good morning, Stephen. How are you feeling today? Look to the left, to the right. Only after-images for the rest of his life; Since yesterday hospital-sounds following me everywhere all the way from New York in the car. The whole night - even in my dreams. When will I get rid of them? Good evening A 28-ton trailer truck with a Dane at the wheel and two czechoslovak refugees in the cab crashed into Austria from Czechoslovakia yesterday by ramming a metal gate at the border. WASHINGTON: More then two hundred thousand Americans, most of them black but many of them white, demonstrated here today for a full and speedy program of civil rights and equal job opportunities. Pula - Premier Khrushchev und President Tito ended two days of official talks on Brijuni islands today. Have doctors told you anything about your memory? They said they didn't know. Didn't they hold out any hope that you might get it back one day? Any at all? I don't know. What about dancing do you remember it? Dancing? Dancing? Yes, it might do! Would you? Intermissions! It's like suddenly waking up from a dream. How would it be to wake up with no memory to not know who, what, where from? No past, no friends to ask. Just a body without a history. Maybe it's still easier for him then for her discovering that her man - who she thought was dead - is alive but without any memory. He doesn't recognize her, he doesn't believe her! Will it happen again tonight? Steve, lying beside me. I hear him breathing, I smell his body. Hmm... memories of him. Imagination. Maybe it's the room, the furniture, the environment that keeps the memory. I am glad I'm moving out tomorrow. You see, you dance very well! You are a kind woman. A woman... don't you remember having loved one? No. Being engaged, once... far from Paris. Don't you remember? No. And being married, once to a woman called Thérèse Langlois. Don't you remember? In Chaulieu, Chaulieu-sur-Loire! This is George Geesey from WGBH 89.7 with the morning edition of our broadcast yesterday of the Civil rights march, as part of the Educational Radio Network we will bring to you some of the highlights of the events. Let's start with a song, that expresses best the feeling and the mood that brought together 250 thousand people in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Will that be all Ma'am? What's with the radio? The radio! Should I take it? No thanks, you can leave it. I'll carry it with me in the car. I'll follow you in a minute. We'll meet in Cape Cod. Thank you. What an experience! Singing in front of 250,000 people, singing and fighting with them. Should I go to Europe? Join the Living Theater again? Trade the stage for the streets of Rome, Paris, London. Be with the people in the streets. I need some time. First Cape Cod, then I'll see. So I say to you, my friends, that even though we must face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!' John F Kennedy Airport; Another three days in New York, then Rome. My new life: Together with the Living Theater again, working with Luigi Nono on his new piece dedicated to the Vietcong. Traveling on a train like living in a dream. An in between state the past is gone, the future is yet to come a bright faraway light. It is a fact, that one never sees the sun in a dream, although one often is aware of a brighter, faraway light! Wasn't that a French poet? What was his name? He went insane. The other passengers sharing the same space and time, the same dream so close and yet so distant. If anybody's friend be dead it's sharpest of the theme the thinking how they walked alive, at such and such a time. Their costume, of a Sunday, some manner of the hair, - a prank nobody knew but them, lost, in the sepulcher; How warm they were on such a day. You almost feel the date, so short way off it seems; And now, they're centuries from that...
