[nate] her name's grace. She's an amazing photographer. [isabel] yeah, well, anyone who can make you look good. You know, she was there Just taking photos of amish people, But there are some mennonites who lied to get their photo. Put it away. It's wrong. It's worldly. I made a promise to god just 20 minutes ago-- I know. I'm sorry. I know how important today was. Yeah. [isabel] only the most important day of your entire life. So... Do you feel different? I do. I feel... Responsible. I don't know if I'm ready. It's like going through a door That you can never go back through. I can see my whole life now. Family, church, god... You can get married now. You know what, maybe I should get baptized. -[laughs] -[nate] what? You're not done running around yet. You love rumspringa too much. I do, okay? No, you're not ready. You love worldly things too much. -And you love yourself too much. -Junky car. If you got baptized, You'd do something or say something the first week And you'd be shunned, And then it would be goodbye, nate. Straight to hell. Maybe you're right. [♪♪] [♪♪] You're idling. No, it's... -It's just that-- -what? There's something. Look. It's perfect. Those beans are getting cold. Yes, mem. [♪♪] [♪♪] [bevin] dat! Dat! [dat] what is it, bb? What happened? A splinter. Well, let's see what we can do. Whoa. Easy now, bb. I would never hurt you. Never. You know, I once heard a story About a little boy Who had a splinter in his finger, Just like you, And he did not take it out. And it became an apple tree! And when he would clap his hands, Apples would fall down everywhere! [laughs] There! It's out! I'll plant it and we'll have apple pie! Now, go on. The unbroken thread, my daughter. You are now a part of it. We have an obligation To those who came before and to those who come after. "I know that the lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted." "and will execute justice for the needy." Baptism is not the end of something. It is the beginning. A marriage, a home, a family. A man to serve. Yes, I know. God has a plan for you. You don't want to let him down. Yes, mem. Mem? Do you remember when I had scarlet fever? Mm-hmm. I liked that fever. I liked the way Everything swam around and changed color. I wasn't scared. I tried to tell you. Do you remember? I still look for That fever beauty in this world. And sometimes, just-- Sometimes, I see it and it makes me cry. Genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers... [man] hello. Does anyone live here? Iddo! Uncle iddo's here! [iddo] I'm looking for lucas! [iddo laughs] ha-hah! There he is! Where's your brother? Come, come, come! Oh, you're so strong now. [mem] rachel! Rachel! [iddo] look what I brought. Don't show your dad. [mem] uncle iddo is here! [iddo] and now I'm behind this truck-- And the driver's giving me the wave. He wants me to pass him! And I'm shouting, "hello! I'm driving a horse!" [laughing] A tired horse! Rachel. Rachel, say hello to your uncle iddo. Hello. He brought you a present. [iddo whispers] do you want to give it for me? Come on, open it! [iddo] forgive me for missing your baptism, rachel. I had an emergency at the shop and I just couldn't get away. I'll always regret Not seeing you enter the kingdom of heaven. Seeing you reach your hand from one world into the next. That flower will wither in a few days, But your soul will shine forever in the eyes of heaven. You made god happy today. Amen. [mem] are you spending the night? [iddo] no. I wanted to stop by. Such an important day. But I have to be at the shop in the morning. Come on, uncle iddo! Please stay! [iddo] another time! Please! Please! I promise! -Bye! -Goodbye! -Bye, uncle iddo! Come back soon! Bye, uncle iddo! [iddo] be good to your mem. And don't forget to say your prayers. I'll be checking next week. I'll see you then. [boy] we'll miss you. [iddo] okay, goodbye. [boy] bye, uncle iddo! Bishop. Neighbors. I... I need to confess a sin. I had... I was inappropriate... With my daughter's friend, anna lapp. Several times. In our house. I was weak... ...And I fell. I recognize the error of my ways And... I accept your judgement. This transgression cannot go unpunished. As always, We look to the words of jesus christ for guidance. We also look into our own hearts And ask ourselves, "who are we? What do we stand for? What is it that sets us apart?" As the lord has forgiven you, So you must also forgive. Anna, can you find it in your heart To forgive this man? I forgive you. [bishop] if this young woman Can find forgiveness in her heart, Then we have no choice But to follow her toward the grace of god. Malachi stoltzfus, You will be put on proving for six weeks. If we are satisfied As to the earnestness of your penance, You will be forgiven. You may sit. I think malachi did well. Poor girl. But she probably tempted him. Daughters of eve. [tour guide giving a tour on the amish community] Have fun in hell! It's okay. I know it's... Isn't iddo a bit old for her? Leah was the youngest. Only 25 when she was in the accident. And iddo's what... Only 35? Of course, we would not mention it to her Without your approval. He's a good man, though. You're right about that. He's already part of the family. He's good to everyone. Such a big heart. He's doing very well in his furniture business. And iddo is healthy. They could have a big family. Eight, ten... He's a sober and responsible man. And there's something else. The way he looks at her. He likes her. Sara, don't presume. You do not know what is in someone else's heart. I know him. We can't force this. We can only suggest it. Of course, But rachel is a practical girl and she respects your opinion. It is her choice. Of course. We know that. Thank you, bishop. God, I need you right now. You need to help me. I can't do this. [♪♪] [mem moans] [mem moans] [rachel] mem! Mem, are you-- are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. -Do you need water or something? -Yes, some water. Okay. I'm-I'm just tired. Mem, I don't think you look like you're doing okay. I'm fine, liebchen. Okay. Here. Now you're taking care of me. It's funny. I'm feeling better. My mother used to get these. She would have to sit down And everybody would take care of her. She used to call them her little vacations. Mem... I need to talk to you about something. What is it? It's about iddo. Oh, I forgot to tell you. He's... He's here. What? He came over. He's spending the night. Where is he? Do you know he fixed that chair in the living room. -One, two, three. -Where is he now?

You can't make a mistake. You don't want them to know who you really are. The way you've tempted me. Can you imagine what they'd say if they saw us? You want me to keep your secrets. Let me take care of you... The way I've always done. I know the wicked thoughts of your black little heart. I see you the way no one else does. You're broken, rachel. A filthy, broken, ugly child. [mem] iddo! Chocolate's ready! The kind you love! I can save you. [♪♪] [eli] have you been drinking the tea? Morning and evening. There are tests, sara. We can take you into town. Levi wouldn't like that. I really am doing much better. This is the fifth child you've lost? Forgive me, sara, if I've embarrassed you. Why can't I have any more children, eli?

[♪♪] [♪♪] Isabel. What are you doing here? [isabel] I'm sorry. [♪♪] Child... [rachel wails] [sobbing] Let us help you, child. [bishop] we're taking you to a place Where they help girls who've lost their way. Everything can be forgiven in time. Rachel. Welcome to bright haven. We are so happy that you've come to join us. Would you please remove your shoes? Life skills from 5:00 a.M. Until to 7:00. We take you through harvest all the way to canning. And then bible study from 7:30 until noon. Then lunch. And then bible study from 1:00 p.M. Until 5:00. Yeah. And then from 5:00 until 5:30, free time. We like to think of this as our-- As our house of love. We want to help you prepare For your roles As wives and mothers in the world And instill values That will admit you into the kingdom of heaven. Our goal is to fill your heart with light And the joy that can be found in the divine love of god. Only girls accompanied by staff can leave the building. Rooms are locked at 7:00 p.M. "wives, be subject to your husbands, As to the lord, Without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, That you might be holy and without blemish. For the husband is head of the wife As christ is head of the church." Now, this is our struggle. The individual. The unsatisfied mind. God has given us rules. All that we need to do is follow them without question. God is judging our every move, our every thought. I know that each one of you has sinned, Even in your tiniest, most private moment. Perhaps spending a little too much time In front of the mirror, For a split second thinking that you might be pretty. You are not pretty. You are vain and weak. You are wicked and dirty. You disappoint god a million times every day With your carnal thoughts and your dark desires. You have forgotten that god loves you. Seven o'clock! Be at peace! She's not that bad, you know. She's helped a lot of girls. She understands what it's like. I think she had some trouble in her past. I heard she was married. I heard he died. No, no, she ran away, Then came back, and then he died. I ran away. Or I tried to. We all did. That's why we're here. Not me. I stayed. I tempted my cousin And then I tried to blame it on him. What did he do? It's what I did. I told everyone about us. I guess I... Thought I deserved to be heard. Anyway, what good is running away? Where would we go? Who would want us? [girl] they don't open. I just wanted to get some air. It's so we're not tempted. It only gets really bad in here in August. How long have you been here? This is my third time. [ruth] he would say, "you're not trying hard enough," And... "your brain looks like a messy closet," And that I should clean it up. If he ever spoke to me. Thank you, ruth. Rachel, what would god say to you? He would say... "why, rachel?" "why can't you just be good?" He would say... "why do I waste my time with you?" "all you do is make the wrong choices."

They really did a number on you, didn't they? Look, um... Nate... Didn't tell me why you were coming to stay with me. As a survivor, I can only assume that someone was hurting you. Someone you knew. Someone you trusted. Did someone hurt you, rachel? You don't understand. No, I do. I really, really do. Do you know that I hate cinnamon? I can't stand the smell of it. Mem was baking in the kitchen And the house smelled of cinnamon. I sat at the table coloring with the other kids. Uncle iddo sat next to me. It was daytime. There were people around, but he didn't care. He reached under the table. It hurt, But I couldn't let anyone know what was happening. I was so afraid. Afraid it was my fault. How old were you? Eight. That was the first time. You are out of there now and you are never going back. You have a new life here. I'm going to make it happen for you, I promise. Do you think so? I know so.

They want me to bring you back so they can show you it. How are bevin and the twins? Bevin thinks you're working. How do I live? Nobody knows me, and I... I don't have a family anymore. I'm like those people on the screen-- Moving and talking, but trapped behind glass. But you're not alone. You don't know. I mean, you can go back. You still have a choice. I'm living with strangers. I don't understand half the things they say. -Rachel-- -no, nate, you have to go. This is too hard. I can't do this. Okay. Will you at least walk me out? I'm sorry. Thank you for coming today. It's okay. I wanted to come. God's gonna look after you no matter what you do, rachel. I believe that. I want to believe that. You know, I don't think I've ever had the chance to say this, But... I admire you, rachel. I really do. Have you ever been to the ocean before? No. Why? My mother talked about it sometimes, But I don't think she's actually been.

Keep my options open. Good night, rachel. Good night, nate. [♪♪] [rachel] I'm coming out of the bedroom. Going to the bathroom. [knocking] [grace] almost done. Grace, I...

Dat, which room? [monitor beeping] I know you don't want to talk to me. I don't blame you. I know when I left, it caused you a lot of pain. That probably made you sicker. Remember when I told you about that fever beauty? How you can see things in a way That are so... Clear and shocking And... Right? That's you, mem. That's the part of you that is in me. I know you're supposed to shun me right now... And I know it's out of love. But I'm going to stay here And I'm going to take care of you Until you're better. I will make it up to you, I promise. Rachel... What is it, mem? I see you. I'm sorry. I can change-- I see... ...Who you are. Strong... ...And true. You are the best of us. You are the one who can fly. It was never your fault. Never. None of it. Rachel... ...The sea... Knows.

Thank you. It is you who have died. You we have buried today. I'll pray for you, rachel. Pray that you find your way back to god. Pray that it's not too late. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [dat] thank you, ladies. That was wonderful. [bishop's wife] I'll put the lamb up. They can have that for supper tonight. Rachel, where did your mother keep-- Oh. I'll find it. [bishop's wife] I think we brought too much bread. I'll take some loaves home and bring fresh on Wednesday. [woman] sara's canning was always so organized. She was a wonderful mother to her children. I will miss her. I remember when my mother died. There was so much I wish I had done for her. It took me many years to forgive myself And realize... I had done my best. Mothers and daughters-- It's always bumpy And the conversation is always left unfinished. I think about friends Who will reach out their hands and their hearts to me, No matter what I've done. Always there with guidance when we need them. In these difficult times. Amen. Children, go upstairs. Yes, dat. Rachel, sit down. Here with me. Much has changed since we last spoke. Many things have... Happened. We have... We have both made choices that we will have to live with. I spoke with the bishop. You may be forgiven. You must earn your way back into the church. It will be hard work, but it can be done... ...And we can live together again in the sight of god. You will find a nice young man in church... ...Someone to care for, And it needn't be iddo. Bevin and the boys need their sister. This house needs to be cared for. Stay with us, rachel. Here... You are loved. Dat says I'm not supposed to talk to you. I know. But I guess I'm already talking. I guess so. What are you doing? I'm looking through mem's hope chest. It was a gift for her 16th birthday, And she put things in it For the day she'd be married. Things she'd need. [bevin] so it's full of her hope? Yes. Full of her hope. Bevin, do you know why I left? Because I did something wrong. What? No. Why would you think that? I don't know. Oh, bevin! You did nothing wrong. You are perfect. Then why did you go? Hope, I guess. [bevin] look, it's mem! She looks so beautiful. Did she make this? [rachel] all the things she dreamed about. All the things she could have been. "the sea knows" The sea knows. [rachel, reading] "in the countless blue drops Of her restless heart In the splash and the salt She knows the possibilities of each and every drop Who they are And how they magnify each other How they keep their secrets..." "the sea knows everything Except herself." Mem was a poet and an artist All these years ago. But why did she stop? [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] ♪ through the floodgates of god's mercy ♪ ♪ flowed a vast and gracious tide ♪ ♪ grace and love like mighty rivers ♪ ♪ poured incessant from above ♪ ♪ heaven's peace and perfect justice ♪ ♪ kissed a guilty world in love ♪ Bishop. I know I have no voice in here, but I have a confession. I need a place to talk to god And a place to maybe find some hope. I've been told there's a chance for me to come back, And... ...Maybe you'll find it in your heart To allow me to speak. Please. Come in, rachel. I have been weak... And selfish. I have made a lot of mistakes. I need your help to get right with god. I believe what I've learned in this church. "I know that the lord Will maintain the cause of the afflicted And will execute justice for the needy." I've learned that in here and at home. It's a good lesson. That's why I love this church. I'm confessing a sin. I ran away in secret, And it was cowardly, And... It's a sin that goes against everything that I was taught. So I will tell you now That I am... I'm leaving the church And my family and my home. And it will break my heart And it will be lonely and difficult, But I will do it with my head held high. It is the only way I can take responsibility for what I believe. Rachel! Be still! I will not be still! I came to you for protection And you beat me. You have nothing to say to me. I will miss you every day of my life, But I do not trust you. You destroyed that trust. I have learned something else. Something my mother has taught me. I think I'm starting to understand who I am. There's this other rachel who needs my protection. Who needs a safe place to grow. No matter how hard that is... I have to give her a chance. And one other thing. I'm not gone for good. I will be visiting. And if I hear that anyone touched my little sister... Or was... "inappropriate" with any other woman... ...I will have the police here so fast, You won't know what hit you. Rachel! [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [nate] how long Do you think you're going to stay at grace's? She'll let me stay until I find a job. Maybe we could park cars together? I don't think so. Why not? I got fired. You'll find another job. Look, rachel, I'm just going to move back in with my parents. Things aren't working out for me out there, So I'm just gonna start my baptism classes. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Where are we going? There's something I want you to do. I think you... I think... You know what, There's something you need to do. For you. Um... I don't think I'm going to see you after today. I understand. [♪♪] [♪♪] Give her a minute. Show them who you are. [rachel, writing] dear bevin, What do you think of the drawings I sent you? I think I'm getting better every day, But... I have a long way to go. [children laughing] Got you! [girl] okay, ready? You're it! [rachel] it's time. [bevin] okay. [rachel] I'm not gone for good, you know? I'm going to visit. [bevin] I know. But, bevin, I want you to know that-- I know all this stuff. Don't worry. Here. It's you. [♪♪] [rachel, writing] I'm finding that mem was right. The sea knows. It knows how to be calm and sure. It knows when to be fierce. It knows where it belongs. I think maybe I can learn from it. I'm trying anyway. Mem would like that. I'm so excited That you're coming to visit me next week. I'll show you where I live. I'll take you to the beach, And we'll walk, and we'll swim... ...And we'll see what happens next. All my love, me. [♪♪] [♪♪]
