That was wing commander Mason in V-Victor. Took off 23:30. B-Baker. - B-Baker coming up now. B-Baker away, 23:32. B-Baker, flight lieutenant Brown, airborne at 23:32. That's the third one now. Yes? Pilot officer Greeno airborne in S-Sugar, 23:33, Roger. Give me the operations room, please. Operations here. Hi, Toby. All three airborne, 23:33. Right. Oh, Toby, have you got the answer to 17 across? - No? - Group operations, please. Well, you've got seven hours to think about it - before they get back. Right. - 9-2 base here. Hello. Operations here. Yes. Observer corps? Three of them? Yes, yes. They're ours. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello, control? Our three lancasters have been sighted coming in over the coast. North of Lowestoft. - North of Lowestoft. Yes, isn't it good? Good bye. Make that 05:41 hours, Bridges. Very good, sir. Oh, Sandy, the leader's just sent out the codeword. Buster. Buster? Successful. - Intelligence, please. Are you scrambled? - Group captain Logan, please. Morning, Tim. Success, I hear? Yes, sir, I think so. As far as I can see, we got it all right. Had a bit of a trouble with a fighter. Got the rear gunner. I'll go and have a look at him. Hey, that was a pretty ropey landing, brat. Why don't you learn to fly that thing? Quiet, bushwhacker! Have you got a fag, Ackroyd? Scrounging again, sir? - Well? - It's a bad one, sir. I'll let you know when I've got him to bed. Hello, sir. Thanks, Mac. My new rear gunner's, sir. Took over when Anderson got hit. Well done, Baker. How do you like it? I prefer the cockpit of a b-17, sir. Got a fighter, ju-88, been tailing us for hours. Oh, I don't know. Everybody had a shot at it. That's right, Mac. I don't think you got him. Is that right? - Good morning, sir. - Morning, flight. You collected a packet there, all right. - Where did that come from? - Port Rudder, sir. All the controls are sheared on that side. I saw his cannon shells going by, sir. I didn't realise he actually hit us. Close thing, Tim. - Flight sergeant. - Sir. Well, it's a nice clean flesh wound, sir. I think he'll do. Keep him flat on his back for a few days. I really came to see Mason. At group they think he's done too much flying. How is he? Oh, he's all right, sir. I've been watching him. He doesn't sleep well. He's highly strung. But he's set his mind on finishing this tour of ops. - What's the group captain think? - He'd hate to lose him. Mason's the best wing co we've have on this station. Maybe. I'd better go and see him, all the same. He should be in his office, sir. Hello, Smithy. - Morning, sir. He's expecting you. Hello, doc. Just waiting for the news to come through. I hear it all went very well. Yeah. How's my rear gunner? I've just had a look at him. He'll mend all right, Tim. Good. Buchanan tells me you've not been sleeping too well. That doesn't mean anything. It's my job to keep awake at night. You didn't come all the way from group to tell me that now, did you? How many trips have you done now, Tim? As if you didn't know. 87. That's too many. It's time you stopped flying. - I'll stop when I said I would. When I've done 90. Do you know how many crews on an average get through 30 trips in bomber command? I have no idea. It's part of my job to keep the casualties down in the squadron. Only four crews in ten. You've done 87. Last night wasn't so funny from what I hear. Why don't you pack it up now? Yes? Yes. Thank you very much, sir. Yes, I'll tell him right away. About five minutes. Right. They've got the pictures and we've wrecked the place. Smithy! Oh, come on, doc. 90. Then I'll do anything you like. Tim, you're an idiot. All right. But I'm going to keep my eye on you. Smithy, get hold of Bill Brown and the brat. Report to the co's office immediately. All right, sir. Goodbye, doc. Got a call for you, sir. Thank you. Hello. Major Baker speaking. This is general Wannerberg. I've just had a report in about you. Now, listen, major, your job here is liaison with the British air force. You are not assigned to fly around Germany nights. I know, sir, but I thought as this was a special mission I might-... That was none of your business. You've had all your flying missions. From now on you sit behind a desk. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Then see to it that you're strictly non-operational, Baker. Okay? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hi, Mac. - Hi, Mac. - Where are you guys going? - Co sent for us. I'll wait for you in the bar, with a poultice. Yeah. Come in. Have you anything to say first? Well, this time what you've been up to seems to have gone further than usual. As far as the air ministry. Have you anything to say? Well... - No, sir. Flight lieutenant W. Brown, pilot officer P.D. Greeno, I have been requested to inform you... You two chaps have got the dfc. Immediate awards. The signal was originated at 11:47 hours this morning. Very well done, both of you. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. How about the skipper, sir? Bar to his dso. So you've all been taken care of. Going up to group this afternoon to see the photographs. - We'd better meet in the mess. - 12 o'clock. I'll run you down to Dobbie's pub aftennards. - Sounds like a bit of a party, sir. - Could be. They've even given me the date of your investiture. Buckingham Palace, exactly a month from today. That'll mean two days leave for both of you. - You'll have to fit yours in, Tim. - Yes, sir. Well, that's the appointment. London in a month's time. All right, chaps. Thank you, sir. Hello? What's this? Looks like she might need some help. No, you're too young, I think I'd better deal with this. Morning. Anything wrong? - Well, it just stopped. Better have a look at it. - You all right for petrol? - Yes, there's plenty of petrol. I'll check the ignition. The lead's loose for a start. Nice looking car. When it goes. Comfortable too, I'll bet. It's all right. He really knows more about scooters. There you are. All ready. - Thank you very much. Not at all. I wish it had taken longer. Perhaps I can do better next time. Yes, and with fewer people looking on. Get back on board, skipper, I'll meet you down at the pub. Oh, I think I'd better drive her in case the motor stops again. You're a fast worker. Will you join us? - Thank you. - Good morning, Dobbie. - Morning, sir. Hiya, Dobbie. - Morning, all. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Well, now to introduce ourselves. My name's Logan, this is flight lieutenant Brown from Australia, flight officer Greeno from nowhere in particular, and wing commander Mason. And Mac over there has probably already given you a false name. My name's Canyon, Eve Canyon. I'm very grateful to you all. Well, this is a celebration, Dobbie. Five bitters. And, miss Canyon...? - Er, Mrs.. - Mrs.. Cider, I think, please. - Cider, Dobbie. - Right, sir. Dobbie, here's a piece of tin for your collection. My word, what's this? Something special? A piece of very old, tired lanc. When did this happen, wing co? Last night, something bumped into us in the blackout. - Mac shot the offender down. - That's the routine. He stuns them. I shoot them down. Think nothing of it. - Come on, brat, I'll beat you at darts. - Okay. Thank you. Give us a light for the dartboard, Dobbie. So, you're all celebrating? Well, sort of. We'll do it properly tonight with the rest of our crews. I'd like to ask questions but I know I can't. Where do you work? Somewhere locally? No, London. Whitehall. Oh. Government offices, eh? And your husband, is he... I'm a widow since dunkirk. I'm sorry. -that's all right. Army? -no, Navy. - Are you married? - Hm? Me? No, no one's ever asked me. Well, keep trying, you never know. Look, why don't you stay up tonight and come to the party? Dobbie could fix you up. Well, I'd like to. I could. - I don't have to be back until tomorrow. - Good. Have you got a room for mrs Canyon tonight? Hey, hey, hey. Who's working fast now? Yes, I've got a room, madam. Attaboy, skipper! Look, you fix it up with Dobbie, we'll be down this evening. We've got a lecture to attend this afternoon. Yes, some naval intelligence stooge is coming down to shoot his mouth off. Well, come on, fellas, drink up. We've got to leave. Right. Ishahleave all the details of the damage to be described by the naval intelligence people who've made a special study of the target. Most of the damage is in the right place, as you can see. Below the waterline. Would you come in now, please? May I have your pointer? Good afternoon, gentlemen. I must apologise for the fact that such distinguished airmen should have to be addressed by a woman, but even in the admiralty, there's considerable call on the services of... Stooge intelligence types. Now, the assessment of last night's attack is as follows. Yes, I know them all. And a lot of the wives too stay here when the boys are not flying. Not only the wives either but I have to be very careful because of the wing commander. Why? Doesn't like girlfriends around when the boys are up flying. Doesn't matter who it is. He says it lowers the morale. - Good evening, Dobbie. - Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. I ought to call you ma'am but I don't know how any of us can face you. Did mrs Canyon tell you about our second meeting, Dobbie? No, sir. Why? - She put us all smartly in our places. - I'm sorry. Not at all. You did it very well.. Have another drink. - Thanks, I'd love a gin. Dobbie, two large gin and tonics... Funny how you can hear that. Even with all this noise. It's been going on every night now for the past three weeks. Must be a relief to know you haven't got to do that tonight. Yes, it is, in a way. I don't understand how you ever get used to it. I never have and I never will. Then how do you go up? By being scared that someone will see how afraid you are. Anyway, that's the usual excuse. I have no excuses. I just scuttle like a rabbit and I don't mind who sees me. I'd awfully like to see you again sometime. I'll save you a place in the shelter. I'll be in London about the end of the month. I live at 49, mount square. Western 00-09. You'd better write it down. I think I'll remember it. Now we'd betterjoin the others. Boy, I'm hungry, let's go and eat. No, you go ahead, I'll join you. I'm just going to make a phone call. It's pilot officer Greeno here. Can I have telegrams, please? Vveh, isuppose you'll head straight for Piccadilly and drink enough liquor to float yourself over a wall. Ah, not me, brother. I've got another idea. I made a date with Eve Canyon. - Oh. - Yeah, oh. Any messages? No, thanks, I can deliver my own messages. - Contact. - Contact! You know, Tim, you're one of the best losers I ever saw. Good luck! What are you going to do after the war, Brownie? Back home to Australia and take up sheep farming. That's a funny sort ofjob for a guy who's been a bomber pilot, isn't it? Well, there's nothing funny about it, it's... One of the best jobs out. You need lots of space and lots of sunshine. You ought to come out there and see it. Yeah, I've often thought I'd like to go to Australia. I'd like to travel. I've never been abroad except for all over Germany, that is. You know, after the war, I'm going to become a lounger. I'm going to settle down and... Do nothing and just think how good it is to be alive. Yeah? What are you gonna use for money? I don't know and I don't care. I'm going to be an old married man with a squad of kids and forget all about aircraft. Well, we've got a lot more trips to do before then. The skipper's certainly got a jinx on him. Those night fighters just can't miss him. Attention, please. All operational crews report to crew room. Well, here we go again, boy. All operational crews report to crew room. - Hey, brat. - Yeah? What's doing? Oh, I'm waiting for an air test. It'll have to wait a bit longer, skipper wants you. Wants me? What for? Dunno, boy, but I wouldn't keep him waiting too long. Nothing wrong, is there, sir? Haven't a clue. Come in, Greeno. You're here because the security police find it necessary to check on your activities. The charge being that every time you come back from an operation, you send a telegram to London from the officer's mess. Yes, sir. And each time in code. - Yes, sir. - Why? It's a private matter, sir... no, it's not! Why can't you use what brains you've got? Perhaps you've forgotten that German fighters were waiting for us on the mulheim raid. No, sir. Who did you expect to receive these telegrams? Or rather, whom did you hope would receive them? Agirl, sir. You mean to say you've been deliberately risking the security of this squadron for a girlfriend? I didn't think of it in that way, sir. Then you'd better start thinking now! Yes, sir. Your love life's nothing to do with me. But your flying life is. And when the one interferes with the other then I step in. If you get through this tour of ops in one piece, you can send telegrams to every girl in england as far as I'm concerned. But at the moment you're a member of this squadron and your duty's here! Yes, sir. I can square this with the security people if I take personal responsibility for your future conduct. Is that a fair risk? Yes, sir. -then wake up! All right. That's all, you can go. Thank you, sir. - Hello. - hello, Mac. You're punctual. I thought you might get held up in the rain. I took shelter in the bar. I thought there was no harm in being mildly conventional. Oh, Mac, they're marvellous. - Where did you get them? - I won them. They were decorating the bar I was in. How's everyone up in Lincoln? Oh, just fine. Couple of them sent messages to you but I'm too bashful to repeat them. How's Tim Mason? He's a bit of a sorehead sometimes but he's all right. You don't sound too sure about it. Yeah, well, he's doing too much. Anyway, why are we talking about him? Well, why not? You like him, don't you? Don't know of an englishman I like better. Whisky all right for you? - Yeah, straight, please. There you are. -thanks. - Well, cheerio. - Cheers. - All right? - Fine. I don't know if you feel like going out but I've arranged dinner for us. Oh, Mac, I can't, I'm on duty tonight. Oh, no! - Well, it isn't my fault. They can't do this to me. I'd like to have a nice long chat about you. And about me. About you and me. Anyway, tomorrow we can... What time do you come off duty? Long before you'll be awake. - Goodnight, Todd. - Goodnight. Taxi? -mac! Morning, sir. Flight lieutenant Saunders is coming down to see you, sir. Right. Ops room want you, sir. Maximum effort tonight. Oh. Jump in. Skipper's in a hurry. - Yeah, anotherflap on I suppose. You'll just have to write to this girl and tell her no more telegrams. That'll drive her crazy, Bill. I don't know what to do. Well, it's better that way, brat. You know, there's only one way to treat women when you're on this job. When you're with them everything's serious and when you leave them it's all forgotten. And if they never see you again, nobody get's unhappy... Yeah, but this is different... yeah, I know... Yeah, but this really is different. Oh, I don't know what to do. You know, sometimes you can put a jinx on yourself getting mixed up with a girl. And we don't want any jinxes in this outfit. Well, I've done all right up to now, haventl? We've crashed one aircraft so we can only put up 15. Of course, everyone's very tired after last night but we'll do it all right. They know at group that it's a big order, flying some of them two nights running. Especially after last week. Yes, sir. We'll manage somehow. You going to take the night off, Tim? No, I'll take charge of the ops room. What is that noise? It's Greeno, sir. - What's the matter with him? He's in love. I think it eases his soul. Poor chap. - So long, Tim. - Goodnight, sir. G'day, brat-o, what's the dirge in aid of? Hiya, Bill. Do you have a good sleep? - Yeah, like a baby. I'm off now, the skipper's just confirmed my leave. Is there any more news from Devonshire? Well, the town clerk at some place called Dereford has raked up 37 browns for me to have a look at. Say, if all 37 buy you a drink the results should be quite lively. Well, I'm off. - See you. - Yeah, see you. - Goodbye, Bill. - So long, brat. Is she ready yet, Ackroyd? Can't find the ruddy leak yet, sir. Well, it's not much, you know. We'll have to get in the top line if you're going again tonight. Briefing's at 5:30, they were asking for you. 5:30? I've had it. You will also be able to feel that every time a convoy gets through safely you will have played a large part in helping it home. So, good luck to you. Just a minute, please, everybody. Those of you who flew last night as well as tonight, can draw a double ration of oranges. We can't raise your wages. It's the best we can do. You're leaving in daylight but you'll reach the enemy coast by dusk. - Look out for the... - Trouble, skipper? No, Charlie. You're going in over a moderately defended area so keep your eyes open for those first searchlights. Look out especially for the blue marker searchlight. It's his job to pick you out. - Young beggar. - Good pilot, though. - What are you doing here? - I'm on duty crew, sir. - Where did you get that? - This, sir? It's mr Greeno's, sir, he dropped it getting into his aircraft. I've been polishing it up a bit, sir. I see. I wondered what the noise was. Well, it's not much of a mouth organ, sir, it's a bit out of tune. I reckon it's... More of a mascot, like, sir, yes. You're in mr Greeno's crew, aren't you? Yes, sir. Fitter, a. I've been with him ever since I've been in the squadron, sir. Where do you come from? Sheffield, sir. - Any family up there? - aye, they are that, sir. Missus and two kids. Father and mother, like. You've got two children, have you? Yes, sir. We've got another on the way too, sir. Good heavens. You managing all right? As well as can be expected, sir, with the bombing and all that. Missus, she gets a bit lonely but I keep telling her it's not as if I'm flying. No, it's not like flying. Will it be very late tonight, sir? Back some time after 5 o'clock if everything goes all right. I shouldn't Polish that up too much. He wouldn't like it to taste nasty. Oh, tastes pretty fruity already, sir. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. Right, keep in touch. Salmon coming in on three engines, badly shot up. That's another one accounted for. - Flight sergeant salmon, Bridges. - Very good, sir. Hello. Yes, observer corps. I- Ink, H-Harry, K-King. Yes, that's ours. Thank you. K-king, sir, he's just crossed the coast, he seems to be in trouble. Tell control. - What a shambles. - Control, please. - Something's gone very wrong here. - Hello, control... Hello, Finch. You made it all right. Now what happened? No go, sir. No dice at all. Never saw the target. - Too many searchlights? - No, very light defences, really. The whole target was obscured by haze. You couldn't see a trace of it. What about fires? Bombing was scattered all over the shop. I saw at least a dozen sticks of incendiaries in the open country. The jinx was too strong tonight, sir. - Now, look here, Finch, I'm... What about fighters? Quite a few, sir. He saw one lanc shot down. It was just that everything seemed to go wrong from the start. All right, Finch, go upstairs and tell them. All right, sir. They're standing by for a crash landing, sir, r-roger. Let me talk to control. You're too high, skipper. You won't make it. You won't make it. Go round again! Right. Full power. - She won't make it. - Get control! On the grass! Left, skipper, left! Look out!! They don't think any survivors. No one had a chance. I saw some idiots miles away. Bombing Munich, stupid clots. It was fighter weather. They just sat above us and picked us off. And then about fifty miles on our way back, we were attacked again. Air-sea rescue report p-Peter crashed in the sea off yarmouth. No survivors have been picked up. These are the absolute maximum times for the remaining aircraft, sir. Edward, oboe, X-ray overdue. And sugar? 05:50. Two minutes. Smithy! Get out a squadron order. 118 squadron standing down for seven days as from today - for intensive training. - Very good, sir. Tell the flight commanders I want them up here in three minutes. Righto. He's taking off now. Very good, sir. Send these off, Smithy. -yes. How are the chaps coping, flight? It's a pretty tall order. Well, the blokes are all a bit quiet, sir. A night light that shakes them but they're working very well. Anyway, we'll have the new aircraft in a day or two. And some new crews to fly them. Well, I'll do that right away, sir. Oh, thank you, flight. Mulvaney's been talking to me. They're getting very restive up at group about your leaving the squadron. You've been flying too long, Tim. I persuaded them to let me finish my tour of ops, sir. I've got to keep on the right side of him because one word from him to the aoc that I'm tired and I'm out on my neck. I'd prefer to hand over after I've been to London. You're all right, aren't you? Except for a terrible thirst. You know, when I first called you up, it was for fun. Now it's got serious all of a sudden. Still fun but... mostly serious. Mac, it can't be, for me. Eve, you can't spend the rest of your life looking backwards. You think of the past because you're here. My roots are here. America's not all that far away. Like to try? Mac, I was... That's on account. You've given me a wonderful evening again. You've given me a wonderful leave. I'll see you next time I'm in town. I hope so. And I warn you, I don't give up easily. Two years and a woman's putty in my hands. Flight officer Cranston. Room 41, sir. Oh, thank you. - The new intake, sir. Name, sir? - flight officer Johnson. You're here because you've been chosen from a pretty long list. That's as it should be. This is the best squadron in the command and I have to be choosy. The squadron is stood down for a week, which means you've got seven days to make yourselves at home and prepare for work. Have any of you ever been on a bombing operation? Then you have seven days to get ready for that too. Any questions? All right, that's all. You've got five days to bend it straight. - We'll try, sir. - You won't try, you'll do it. - Put on day and night shifts. - Yes, sir. Control want you on the phone, flight. You can take it in my office. Oh, thank you, sir. Bearing up? - Quite well, sir. - Jolly good. One final day's training tomorrow, then you'll get two days off. Jolly good, sir. Then we're giving a party for you in the mess here. - Hello, Tim. - Hello, sir. - Is everything all right? - Yes, fine. - You'll be ready by Monday? - Top line, sir. Good for you. Hello, Smithy. I just had a telephone call from mrs Greeno, sir. From who? - er, pilot officer Greeno's mother, sir. She wants to visit the squadron to see you, sir. Ah. When? Tomorrow, sir. - Tomorrow? - Hello, Mac. - All right, Tim? I see you've put the pressure on round here since I've been away, huh? Anything I can do? You can take this to the office and do some of my papennork. It's about all you're allowed to do now. They've warned me again about your flying. Have a good leave? -yeah, fine. - How's Eve? - She's fine too. I'll be seeing her myself in a day or two. Oh, how come? I have some stuff to deliver to the admiralty. - Anyway, do you mind? - Yes, I do mind. For all the good that does me. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, flight. Control have rung through. They're after the new aircraft that's just landed, sir. - So we're up to schedule. - Thank you very much. Come on, let's go and see some new lancs. Mrs Greeno. Oh, yes. Well, show her in, will you? Would you come in, mrs Greeno? Won't you sit down? You know, I think there must be some sort of mistake. No. No mistake. I'm mrs Greeno. You know, he never told us he was married. Perhaps that was your fault. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. I wondered if you could give me a few details about what happened. I'm afraid I can't tell you very much. Was it very bad that night? Yes, it was. Were you there? No, I'm afraid I wasn't. It's all right. I know you don't like married men in bombers. And I'm afraid I wasn't much help either. I used to try and telephone him at silly times and that got him into trouble. So then he started to send me telegrams. So it was you. Yes. I hated you when he told me what you said to him. Yes, I'm sorry. I had to make him think of nothing but flying to get the best out of him. But you did get the best out of him. He was tremendously proud of the squadron. Do you have to get back tonight? I hadn't thought. No, I wondered because there's a pub down the road... Oh, yes, he told me about Dobbie's. It'll give you a bit more time and... You could meet some of his friends. It's funny, isn't it? When Peter was here, my name wasn't even allowed to be mentioned. Now that he's gone, I'm given the freedom of the aerodrome. I'll get someone to show you the way. Oh, no, it's quite all right. I'll find my own way, thank you. Right. I'll see you there myself later. Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello, Tim. Am I late? No, I was early. Eve, it's all right about dinner tonight, isn't it? Yes, of course. See you on the 17th, hodge. - Have a nice leave, ma'am. - Thank you. How long have we got? - Three hours. Got time to change? Mm. I've got to catch the 11:30 from king's cross though. They always lead up to the same question. Were you there the night that it happened? That night... The night that Greeno went was... Tim... You see... It might have been my fault. I don't honestly know how much I was to blame. But I can't help thinking... Did I go wrong? How much of it was due to me? Surely you're taking too much on yourself? You can't be responsible for everything. But there are some things you've got to be responsible for. Little things that show you if a squadron's slipping or not. Once they start banking on their luck instead of their training and discipline, you know instinctively what's going to happen next. The accidents start. Accidents which could have been avoided. Then you've got to convince them they're not dealing with a jinx but with themselves. I wish I could help. But I can't. No, I know. I'm sorry. But it did help, getting it... Getting it off my chest. Hiya, Mac. Bill. Hiya, fella. - How was Devonshire? - Great. - Hello, Dobbie. - Welcome back, digger. - Come on, have a drink. - You bet. Pint of bitter, Dobbie. Well, you got backjust in time. Going to be a big party in the mess tonight. Why, what goes? The skipper plans to decorate the mess ceiling. Ceiling? Part of the process of breaking in the new boys. What new boys? Yeah, squads of them. Been some changes around here since you left. Anything wrong? There was but it's pretty well fixed up now. The squadron lost five and crashed two more last week. Something always goes wrong when I'm not around. You, erm... Won't be seeing the brat round anymore, for one. Don't tell her tonight, anyway. - See you later. - Okay, sir. Hello, Bill. I didn't know you were back. Hello, skipper, how goes it? All right. You heard the news, I suppose? Yeah, Mac told me. Now, come on. We're having a party. How's the soot coming? - enough for the whole squadron, sir. - There you are, sir. - Oh, good. Come on, Eric, this is your job. I think Mac ought to start this, sir, he's got the biggest feet. That's a good idea. Come on, Mac, you're a member of the squadron, now you start it off. There's your brew, skipper! Come on, new boys next. Masters, you get up there! Things are warming up. You enjoying yourself? - No, no, no. - You're going up now! Oh, yes, jolly good, yes... what? You're in front. Here you go, boy! Go on! Just a minute, Eve. Get his feet up! Keep it in character! I'm so glad you could come. I want you to come and meet a friend of mine. Mrs Greeno. Eve Canyon. - Hello, mrs Greeno. - How do you do? Look! Did you ever meet my husband, mrs Canyon? Yes, I did. The day he won the dfc. He never told me he used to get up to this kind of thing. Come on, son. Get yourfeet in. Urgh! - It was a jolly good party, wasn't it? - Yes, it was fun. You're sure Bill's taking Pam Greeno back? They were right behind us when we left. I talked to Pam quite a lot tonight. About her husband. She's such a child, Tim, it seems so much worse. And I talked to Mac... about you. He told me you only had one more op to do. He said... Tim, do you have to do it? No, not really. But then why? Oh, I don't know. I've got to do it because I've set my mind on it and a lot of people know I have. Besides, I... What? Well, if! Don't do it, I shall spend the rest of my life wishing I had. Will it be soon? Might be. Wish it could be while I'm still here. Yes, so do I. Well, group have confirmed, sir. Maximum effort tonight. They want to know how many you're putting up. - What did you say? - 25. Make it 26. I'm going. That's good. How's it going? All right, sir. We should be through by 6:30. We've done the incendiary packs and the rest are being loaded. Ten 500's and a cookie. Good show. Keep them at it. All right. Bombs away! - Afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, flight. How's that starboard inner Magneto? Well, we had to change it, sir. It was cutting out dead. - I think I'll just give it a run out. - Right, sir. - Well, flight. Everything all right? - Everything all right this end, sir. - You'll have your 26 aircraft. - Good. Well, this is a big day, sir. Yes, this is it. I phoned mrs Canyon at Dobbie's, sir, but she's out. Shall I try again? No, leave it till later. If she calls me, tell her I'll ring back. Right, sir. All right, sit down, fellas. This is a straightfonnard saturation attack by the whole of bomber command. The target is a new town built by the enemy in the last year for the assembly of new secret weapons. The whole place has got to be wiped out. Let's hear how we're going to do it. Navigation officer. The squadron will rendezvous over the wash with the main bomber stream at 18,000 feet. You will then set course for the Dutch coast. Over the Dutch coast, the pathfinders will drop sky markers on track. Er, these markers will be red clusters at 15,000 feet. Bombing leader. All bomb loads in the squadron will be the same tonight. One 4,000 pounder and mixed he. Zero hourfor the main force is 01:15. Bomb aimers, check your drift on the bomb site all the way, especially after the first turning point. Signals officer. Command on the phone, sir. The master bomber will be in a mosquito, over the target-... Can't hear at the back! - Huh? - We can't hear at the back! Uoudefl the master bomber will be in a mosquito, over the target 15 minutes before the main force attack. He'll be broadcasting on VHF, button D. He will contact main force by using the call word "bulldozer". "Bulldozer". Look out for it. Gunnery leader. Full moon, chaps. So the enemy will probably put up fighters in a solid formation and try to vector them onto the main bomber stream. Test your guns over the sea when you're 25 miles out. And keep your eyes skinned. Met... There's a Ridge of high pressure right across north-west Europe. Full moon will be at midnight, visibility unlimited. Whey! There will be some haze near the target area but not enough to interfere with target indicators. Bases will be clear for your return. There'll be 615 aircraft over the target in 20 minutes, so we needn't feel lonely. Bomb at the right time and your right height. And let's get this job done all in one go. - You want to say anything, sir? - Just a minute, Tim. You're not flying tonight. I want you all to know I've just received a very definite order from bomber command. Wing commander Mason will not be flying tonight. Other instructions as before. Well, good luck. - Tough luck, skipper! - Bad luck, Tim. Sorry, Tim. No use my arguing. Doug Simpson went west on his last trip yesterday and the CNC gave the order himself. Now, take it easy, fella. They're right, you know. You've done more than your share already. Sorry, corp. My fault. Hello, wing co. I didn't expect to see you. Mrs Canyon about? -no, sir, no. She and young mrs Greeno went out together about, ooh, about a half an hour ago. Give me a small scotch, will you? Yes, sir. Anything wrong, sir? What? No, nothing's wrong. Just been given a nice, steady office job. I've been pensioned off. Well, sir, I'd... I'd be the last to ever want to see you leave. But I'm glad to hear what you just said and I don't mind saying so. There's been a very funny atmosphere around here this last week. Everyone getting worried about you. Worried about me? Why? Well, sir, the fact is, everyone up the road thinks that if you do any more flying, well... You may not be coming back one of these mornings. Hello, Mac. -hi, Toby. Hiya, Bill. - Hiya, Mac. Coming down to see us off? Sure thing. I can't wait to see the back of you. Then we'll get some peace around here for a couple of hours. Thanks, Dobbie. You might be right. Don't say anything to mrs Canyon about this, will you? No, sir. I'll see her myself. I'm glad the skipper's out of it tonight. - I had a nasty feeling about him. - Yeah, me too. Well, keep your eye on him, Mac. You can do it better than anyone. And when we get him to London we can give him a real party. Yeah, sure thing. I'll see you down at the take-off. See ya. I'll see you when we get there. We've had to re-enter your 4,000 pounder, sir. One of the studs sheared. Will you have a look at it? All right, corporal. Well, she looks okay to me. Now you be good. Okay, corp. Come on, Steve! Hang on a minute. Just getting a breath of fresh air. All set, digger? - All set? - All set. Well, see you're not late back tonight. I won't be late, boy. Contact! Ready for starting. Contact, port outer. Cut the engines! Cut the engines! All right, hold her up! Can't hold her! Hold on! - Round the other side! - Look out! She's going, look out! Get the ambulance! Get the detonators out and try hoisting it off! Right, sir. Take my aircraft, V-Victor. You'll be a gunner short. How about me? - Fine. Flight? - Sir. Tell ops major Baker's going with V-Victor. - Right, sir. - Come on, up to the end of the line. Got your harness? V-Victor. Wing co's aircraft. Hurry, Tim. Send out a harness! We've got a jinx on us tonight, all right. Listen, Bill, there's no jinx on this crew or any other crew. I'm sorry, skip, but that shook me. Why don't you scrap it, Tim? No, I promised maximum effort. Get aboard, I'm coming too! Well, this is going to take a lot of explaining, brother. I'll think about that tomorrow! Contact! Check bomb door shut. Prepare for take-off. Give me full power. Air speed 60. Air speed 70. Air speed 80. Air speed 90. Air speed 100. Undercar up. Undercars up. Goodbye, fellas. Throttle back. Let's go inside, eh? - Good evening, mrs Canyon. - Hello. - Mrs Greeno. - Good evening. Awful din, isn't it? - oh, never heard anything like it. Comforting, though, after the blitz and their bombers. Thank goodness I never heard any of theirs as close as that. My word, I shall be up all night counting them home. So shall I. I'm on duty at midnight. - Have you just come from the aerodrome? - Yes. Was wing commander Mason there? No, but he must be about because he's not flying. Well, I would like to get a message to him. Well, you could ring the mess. Well, it's rather... well, why not go up there? It'll be all right if you're in uniform. And from what I hear, the wing co could do with some cheerful company just now. All right, I will. Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, mrs Canyon. Do you wanna fly, skipper? No, I'm finished flying. I'll just hang around a bit and see how things go. Engineer to skipper. We used a lot of petrol last hour. - Keep the revs down a bit, mate. - Right-oh. - Oh, hello, mrs Canyon. - Good evening, Simon. I'm afraid I've come at a bad time. I hoped I might see wing commander Mason. I wish you would. Cheer him up a bit. Have you had dinner yet? -no. Well, why don't you join us? We'll leave a message for Tim to come down. Thank you, I'd love it. After dinner, perhaps you'd like to come along to the ops room. We've a very progressive signals officer here and he's fixing up something rather special. Hello, Bill. Mac calling. We'll be company tonight, eh? You cold back there? Down to my stomach. I might be court martialled for this. Well, we all got to go sometime. There's Pascal and his box of tricks. - Hello, Pascal. - Good evening, sir. Does it work? - I hope so. There's nothing really wonderful about it, it's just a vhf set tuned into the master bomber's wavelength and amplified. We should be able to hear him bang over the target. Good. Saunders, you haven't seen wing commander Mason, have you? No, sir. Navigator to pilot. The gee's packed up. We're on dead reckoning from now on. Right. Skipper, Terry here. Dutch coast coming up in about five minutes. Good-oh. Engineer to pilot. Radiator flap's closed. Roger. We're on track, on time. Pilot to gunner. Okay to test your gun. Okay, skipper. Testing gun. Made sure gun's okay, skipper. Good, let's hope we don't need it. Bomb's selected on all switches. Give me the intelligence scrambler, Saunders. Logan, 92 base. When you get a trace of enemy fighters, let me know, will you? Thank you. Dutch coast coming up. Okay, chaps, we're crossing the coast. Keep the lights down and dog all your fags. Bomb aimer to navigator. We're just passing over a river with a railway bridge crossing it. Thanks. Stand by, everyone. Master bomber's broadcasting. Master bomber calling bulldozer.

Can't our radiomen stop this? We are doing everything in our power, general. But it's not enough. - Luftwaffe. - General? - Give the order to go into action. - Yes, general. Attention, attention. Everyone in place a... Peter used to tell me to listen in. Hearing the German raid warnings was a sort of link, really. Being awake and... Knowing it was him keeping everyone awake there. I've never done this before and I've been next to a bomber station all the war. Attention. Enemy aeroplanes flying over west Germany, north friesia and Hanover areas. Flight direction - east. What's he saying? "Hanover"? Yes, I heard the word Hanover. Here we are. Hello, skipper and navigator. The b-markers are just bursting now. About five miles ahead. There they go. That's the German frontier. Blimey, they're giving the master bomber a warm welcome. Master bomber calling bulldozer. Your b-route markers are accurate. Your b-route markers are accurate. Out.

Deploy all available machines over droneburg immediately. Free hunt between 300 and 6,000 metres. Pass this on. Intelligence on the line, sir. Widespread enemy fighter activity developing now. Any sign of their general direction yet? Not yet, sir. Navigator. It's too quiet around here. You sure we're going the right way? We're on track-... Sorry I spoke. Bomb aimer to pilot. Weave a bit, skipper. We're just going over a night fighter beacon. Roger. Calling deputy, calling deputy. Master bomber calling deputy. Back up those k-route markers! Back up those k-route markers! The wind is turning. Fire at will! Master bomber to deputy, master bomber to deputy, hang on... Are we going to lose them now? Not necessarily. Sometimes they fade for a bit and then come back. How far are they off the target, Joe? Some way yet. Master bomber's got about half an hour to go. Yes. Very heavy enemy fighter opposition developing now, sir. But it's too far east for accurate plotting. Mac, do you see any fighters yet? Not a thing, skipper. I can only see lancasters everywhere. What I want to know is is this really worth a court martial? Don't worry, Mac. After this you'll enjoy a court martial. Yes. I had all targets besides droneburg removed. Yes, droneburg. - Alert, heavy artillery! - alert, heavy artillery! Run-up north! -run-up north! - Launcher up. - Launcher is up. Navigator, how far off the target are we? 21 minutes exactly. Master bomber to main force. Master bomber to main force.

From the ground crew, sir. - Thanks, flight. I did two hours persuading bomber command that last night's episode had better be forgotten. Apart from disobeying CNC's orders, you turn up and start shouting in the middle of a carefully prepared pathfinder attack. Waiting for the deputy, sir. We couldn't hear him. Well, of course you wouldn't. He'd been shot down too. You better ring up pathfinders and talk to them. Then you'll be sent on a special mission to the far east. Straight from London. Before you have the time to make any more trouble in this command. Yes, sir. Get in, you blighter. Put ten years on my life! Can't understand this. How do you feel, Tim, now that you've done it? Now that I've done it... It's over now. Eve, I'm going overseas almost immediately, I've just heard. For how long? I don't know. What I wanted to say was... Hi, adj. Oh, hello, Mac. Why aren't you in bed? Just on my way. Thought I'd better remind you of that hotel reservation in London tomorrow. We're all staying at Hampden's. - Hi, Smithy. - Hello, Bill. Hey, Mac, what'd I tell you? I got my letter from Devonshire. It's Nadia Brown and she's definitely related. Can I see the wing co a minute? I'll see. I'm going down there after our party in London. Yeah? You mean what's left of you. I'm afraid the wing commander's engaged. Come on, Smithy. You're coming too, aren't you? I'm afraid not, Tim, I've got to get back to the station. The new wing co arrives tonight. Poor old Smithy. Another one on your hands. Yes. Another one. Well, goodbye. And good luck. Goodbye. And thanks for everything. Come on! Okay, driver. Chocks away. - Where to, sir? - Buckingham Palace! Go on, we mean it!
