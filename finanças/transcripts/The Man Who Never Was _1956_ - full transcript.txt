Last night I dreamed a deadly dream. Beyond the Isle of Skye... I saw a dead man win a fight... and I think that man was I. This we may say- the sun of victory... has begun to touch our soldiers? helmets. I have this day received the following communication... from General Alexander. "Sir, the orders you gave me... "on August 15, 1942... "have been fulfilled. "His Majesty's enemies... "together with their impedimenta... "have been completely eliminated from Egypt... "Cyrenaica, Libya and Tripolitania. I now await your further instructions. " Well, obviously we shall now have to think of something else. I am sure the House will bear with me... if I do not publicly proclaim... what that something else will be. Sicily, eh? I suppose it was the obvious choice. Too obvious. Here we are, all along the North African coast, except for Tunisia... and here's Jerry opposite from the Pyrenees to Greece. He knows we're coming, and he knows we're almost certain to come through here. All he's got to do is to sit and wait for us. As a king's counsel, Montagu, and a leading member of the bar... you've sometimes defended a man in peril of his life. Yes, sir. Well, here's your chance to defend thousands of men. If we land in Sicily now, we shall have 30% casualties getting ashore. We sit in offices and talk about casualties... as though they were just figures on a bit of paper. I take it the chiefs of staff want us to think up a cover plan. One that'll make Jerry think we're going somewhere else. Greece, Sardinia... the south of France. I'm told Corsica is very pleasant. But with respect, sir... the Germans know we need Sicily. They must go on defending it. But we may make them thin their defenses a bit... if they think the main attack is coming somewhere else. You and your outfit must drop everything for it. If we can get Jerry... to move one single battalion... a battery, or even a gun... it's going to save a lot of lives. Now, to your left you will see a further wave of aircraft. Here you see the multicolored chutes which are dropping before you. Ah, there's one taking a short cut. That's what we call jumping to a conclusion, gentlemen. Just for a moment I thought someone had had it. Me too. Those things aren't nearly as safe as they're made out to be. I don't think there's anything for us here, George. Any scheme that means using troops would take far too long to set up. "Use of natural cover. " Let's slide out. Monty, that parachute that didn't open- Suppose we were to drop a fellow out of a plane over enemy territory... with papers on him saying we were going to invade Greece... and his parachute didn't open up. The Germans would find him dead... and the papers... and "A-ha," they'd say, "look at this. "Officer with secret papers, parachute didn't open- they're going to invade Greece. " Do we tell the man who jumps that the parachute doesn't work... or is it a sort of practical joke that he finds out on the way down? Well, of course it'd have to be somebody we didn't mind much about. Are you volunteering? No, George, it wouldn't work. What about using a man already dead? The autopsy would show he'd been dead before he hit the ground. Let's get back to the office and think again. If those boys of yours drink any more coffee, they won't be able to sleep. That won't worry them. They gave up sleeping two days ago. Will you come and get it while it's hot, sir? Monty, what we really want... is something absolutely simple. - The simpler the better. - Good boy, George. You're absolutely right. How about this? Supposing we issue Greek dictionaries to all the troops. Why should we do that unless we intend to invade Greece? That'd fool 'em. I'd make it Eskimo dictionaries. That would really fool them. Pam, first thing in the morning... I want you to get me the fullest possible details... of the tides and currents between... Gibraltar and the Portuguese border. - Between where, sir? - Gibraltar and the Portuguese border. - Yes, sir. - Going for a swim? No. Sardine fishing. Now, Pam, it's getting late. You'd better get off home. Are you sure you don't want some sandwiches before I go? My dear child, you must try not to be so greedy. You think of nothing but my stomach. Go on, hop it. Leave the coffee. Poor Pam. How she does fuss over you. Close the door, George. Come here. That idea of yours yesterday about a dead body and a parachute that doesn't open- Yes? It won't work the way you had it, but... I have an idea about something that just might work. - Good night, miss. - Good night. You there, Lucy? Come on in, Pam. Joe, this is Pam... who runs this war pretty well single-handedly... from crack of dawn till midnight. Pam, this is Joe. - Hello. - Hello, Pam. - Don't mind me. I'm just passing through. - Good-bye, little train. Before you puff off, shall I fix you a drink? Joe brought gin. Later. So, that's Pam. She looks all right. But, Lu... why don't you have a place on your own? This apartment belongs to her parents. We get it rent-free. Besides, I need a nice, steady, sensible girl around, and that's what Pam is. - I've gotta have somebody to protect me. - From me? I hope so. - Come on. You've got to go. - I know. - You flying tomorrow? - Maybe. I've never asked you this, Joe- - Does it scare you? - I get used to it. - You'll ring me when you get back. - As soon as I can. You won't ever forget to ring, every evening. - Because if I didn't hear, I think I'd go mad. - I'll ring, Lu. Or if anything stops me, Larry'll ring. - What do you mean, if anything stops you? - Oh, just anything. - Home long? - About 7:00. You were late. They certainly get their money's worth out of you in that joint. So that's Joe. I always thought he was an American. Maybe the one you're thinking of was. I don't know how you keep away from these boys, Pam. I know me. If I started anything like that, I'd probably fall in love. I'd only want one. And then where would we be? Let's get the war over first... and then I'll think about it. That's what I'm afraid you'll do - fall in love with someone you can't have. - Don't do it, Lucy. You'll only get hurt. - Who, me? Lucy, the languishing librarian? Not a chance. If ever I fall in love, it'll be with a guy who goes out at 9:00 to a nice, safe office... and comes back at 6:00. Not one of these flyers - here today and gone tomorrow. Come in. Commander Montagu and Lieutenant Acres, sir. - Sir Bernard. - Nice to see you. - How are you? - Well, thank you. My chief assistant, George Acres, Sir Bernard Spilsbury. - How do you do? - I'm honored to meet you, sir. I've always wanted to ever since I heard you give evidence in the Shotgun Murders. - You were absolutely masterly. - Thank you. Though, mind you, for sheer brilliance- No doubt if you continue to charm Sir Bernard, he'll give you his autograph later. - Meantime, may we get on? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Sit down. Thank you. Sir Bernard... may I ask you some rather odd questions without explaining why I'm asking them? You may. Suppose I wanted to put a dead body in the sea... let it float ashore and have it accepted by the people who find it... as the victim of an air crash at sea. What sort of body would I need? Do you want the body to show any physical damage? No. - But to look as though he'd died by drowning. - Yes. - Could he be wearing a Mae West? - Yes. - How long in the water? - Two, three days. It rather depends on the information I get from you. I would say your best bet would be someone who died of pneumonia. When somebody dies of pneumonia... there's a certain amount of fluid in the lungs. After a few days in the water, it would be almost impossible... to say that he'd not died of drowning. That is, unless one had reason to be suspicious. You mean, if you were suspicious you'd probably spot it? I would, if it came here. But I don't suppose it would come here, would it? I don't want to ask any awkward questions... but at what sort of place might this body be found? Shall we say... Spain. You wouldn't have any trouble there. I don't think there's anyone in Spain... who would examine the body closely enough to spot the sort of thing that I have in mind. One other thing, Sir Bernard. If we had to keep the body for a week or two... how would we stop it from decomposing? Refrigeration. And while it was being transported? I would suggest some sort of airtight canister packed with dry ice. Why dry ice? It would melt and give off carbon dioxide which would dispel the air. It's the oxygen in air that causes decomposition. It would be possible to store a body in a canister in this way for quite a while. Well, thank you very much. That gives me a start. Sir Bernard, you won't mind if we come back to you on some of these points? By all means. Incidentally, on this question of refrigeration... you'd better have a word with my man Adams, the fellow who brought you in. He has all the facilities here... and I can arrange for him to look after things for you. That would help a great deal. If I were in your place, I shouldn't be able to resist asking what all this is about. Lieutenant Acres, if you were in my place... you would have to remember what we used to be told in the nursery. Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. Go on, George. Good-bye. Thank you very much. Well, so far, so good. That part of it seems to be practical anyway, provided we can get a body. Oh, any decent undertaker will fix us up with a body. I don't think that's a problem. So that in essence, sir, the idea is this: the body of a dead man, dressed as an officer... will be put into the sea from a submarine off the coast of Spain... near Huelva. On the body will be top secret documents... or a letter suggesting our main attack will be Greece... not Sicily. The body will drift ashore. It will be picked up and the papers found. The impression will be that it is the body of an officer... who was traveling by plane... and was drowned when his plane crashed into the sea. Hmm. - Why Huelva? - Two reasons, sir. First, there are strong inshore currents... and a prevailing onshore wind... which will almost certainly carry the body ashore. Second, one of the sharpest German agents in Spain operates in that district. But the beauty of the whole scheme, sir, is that it involves only one man... and therefore might be possible... in the ridiculously short time allowed us. May I have your views, sir? In over 30 years of intelligence work I've never heard of anything like it. Neither have the Germans. It's the most outrageous, disgusting, preposterous, not to say barbaric idea. But work out full details... and be on hand at the war cabinet offices at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. Thank you, sir. You'll need a code name. You can have... Jumbo, Trader, Wigwam... Mincemeat, Jubilee- With your permission, sir, Mincemeat. Operation Mincemeat. Comments and criticisms. Admiral. Well, it's an ingenious idea, of course. Up to now, I've thought of four major ways where it could go wrong. Four? I was going to say 40. First, your body may not oblige by drifting ashore. Next, it may simply be handed over to the British consul for burial. Next, even if the papers are examined... they may not leak to the Germans. And finally, if they do leak to the Germans, the Germans may guess they're a fake. That's all quite true, of course. There are ways in which it can go wrong. But that is so of any operation of war, and certainly any deception plan. - Dickie. - I'm for the idea in principle. But why not the south of France? Then you'd be sure that the Germans would get the documents. After all, Spain is neutral. Sir, perhaps you would allow Lt. Cmdr. Montagu, who put forward the idea... to answer Adm. Mountbatten's question. Well, Montagu? The reason for choosing Spain, sir... is that we don't want the Germans themselves to get the body... because we don't want it examined too closely. But forgive me, even if we could get over these obvious snags... surely we're being far too ambitious. The man might be carrying letters at a lower level... but you can't expect the Germans to swallow fake letters from the vice chief to Gen. Alexander. From their point of view, it'd be altogether too good to be true. Montagu, surely the first question German intelligence will ask themselves... is why the letter wasn't sent through the normal channels... instead of by this - this dead gentleman. It was my intention, sir... to ask for a letter of a personal and private type from you to General Alexander. It might contain certain references to other people... which you would hardly want to go through ordinary channels. You mean saying someone important is a nitwit or something. Yes, sir. There are, in fact, a number of jokes already in circulation that might be suitable. Why is this officer flying to Africa? Where is he going? What's his job? We'd like to make him a major in the Royal Marines, sir... on your staff at Combined Operations. He's an expert on landing craft. You are lending him to General Eisenhower... to whom he also carries a letter. - Oh, I write a letter as well? - Yes, sir. He seems to have jobs for all of us. Can my letter be rude about somebody too? You realize that if the Germans see through this... you're pinpointing Sicily as the place where we are going. - Quite right. - We've got a big agenda. We must get on. This is an imaginative plan... but obviously it needs careful consideration or we may do more harm than good. I think we'd better leave it for the moment. The time is very short, sir, and we must get going as soon as possible. We're aware of that. We'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting. Attention.! I have a feeling it would be easier to convince the Germans... than it is to persuade our masters. It's no use losing your temper. They've got a lot of other things to think about. Then why can't they make up their minds and give us a plain yes or no? They want to mull it over, quite rightly. You'll just have to be patient. The moment they agree, if they do, you can go ahead. Till then, you'll just have to wait. Sticky? Like trying to swim through a barrel of syrup. They just want to stand and chew their cud... and gaze into the distance with big, brown eyes. What are we supposed to do, get on with our knitting? I'll wager that in the end they won't turn it down. I'm going to take a chance and jump the gun. You go and get a body. I'll start working out drawings for a canister. Mosquitoes. One engine. He'll be lucky if he makes it. - Larry. - You all right? Port engine cracked up, and Steve's had it. - Steve? - Just outside Brussels. Light flak. He went down fast. Didn't have time to bail out. Hello? Hello? Joe? I was on my way back. I saw them come in. Are you all right, Joey? I'm all right, baby. I'm fine. It was an easy one. Oh... I'm glad. - 4-3-9. - Is Commander Montagu there? - Yes, sir. He's here now, sir. - Thank you. - Hello? - Commander Montagu? - Yes? - General Nye wants to talk to you. - Thank you. - Montagu? - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Montagu, I want you to be at 10 Downing Street tomorrow morning at 10:30. Of course, sir. Tomorrow morning at 10:30. I'll be there. It's going up to the prime minister. - And Nye- - Sir? Anybody in his senses knows we shall go through Sicily anyway... so we've got everything to gain and nothing to lose. Let the plan be implemented.! Thank you, sir. All right, Montagu, you've got the all-clear. And your submarine's fixed. - Jewell is sailing in Seraph for Malta on Friday. - Jewell? He's the man who put Mark Clark ashore in Africa and rescued General Giraud... so you're in good hands. - Can you make it? - I assure you, sir, we shall make it. Good. Carry on. Yes, I'll hold on. George, it's on. We've got the right of way from the old man himself. "Let the plan be implemented!" I knew he wouldn't shoot it down. May I ask what you're up to? I've got a socking great blister on my foot. I've walked more than 50 miles in the last two days... I didn't go to bed at all last night... and it doesn't matter whether he shoots it down or not... because the whole thing is utterly impracticable. - What? - Napoo. Won't go. Not on. - Hello? Yes. - Why not? Because, Monty, there simply isn't any way of getting a body. You wave an airy hand and say, "George, go and get a body," as though there was nothing to it. - Well, you try. - Nonsense! There are hospitals, nursing homes, mortuaries- - I've tried 'em! Not a hope. - Is he at the hospital now? You see, Monty, every body belongs to somebody... and it isn't a thing people want messed about. What about the fellow in St. Luke's Hospital? Changed his mind at the last moment and recovered. - Very unreliable type. - Yes, we'll come round immediately. - Have you tried Spilsbury? - Yes, he gets bodies. But they're special ones that the police think have been murdered... and he wants them himself. - Sir, I think I'm onto something. - Where? In a small hospital in St. John's Wood. I said you'd come and see the father. There doesn't seem to be anybody else. - When did he die? - 3:00 this morning. - Pneumonia? - Bronchial pneumonia. Are there any other relatives beside the father? I don't think so. He was an only child, and I gather the wife's dead. - Is the father with him now? - He is waiting for you. You wait here. I think I'd rather deal with this by myself. Perhaps you'd like to sit over there while you're waiting. - Thank you. - I'll come back in a few minutes. Right. It has been explained to you... that, for reasons of security... we cannot tell you why we are asking you this? Yes. That has been explained. But if there is any question you wish to ask me, sir... I will answer it if I can. I'll try not to embarrass you. Can you assure me, Commander Montagu... as an officer and a gentleman... that if I agree to your request... my son's body will be treated decently and with respect? I give you my word. His name will never be revealed? Never. And finally... his body will have Christian burial? I cannot absolutely promise that... but I am fairly certain of it. I was never the one... nor was he... to mind very much about the last resting place of the body... being more concerned with the repose of the spirit. But still... I would like to be sure that this thing you are going to do... is good... and worthy of him. I can assure you that... this is an opportunity for your son to do a great thing for England. My son, sir, was a Scotsman... and very proud of it. I beg your pardon. Never mind. We're used to that. You English always talk about England when you mean Britain. Good-bye, son. I don't know what they want with you... but it doesn't matter now... because... you're not here anymore. You're somewhere else... and at peace. Good day to you. I have no son now... but you have a body. I think William Martin is a good name. One naval identity card... in the name of Captain, Acting Major, William Martin... Royal Marines. Born in Cardiff, 1907. I thought of Glasgow, but I don't want to say he's a Scot. Also, a combined Operations Headquarters pass in the same name. You'll need a photograph of him, sir, for the identity card. So we shall. It's only a passport photograph. It needn't look like him. Now, we need various articles to go in his pockets- cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys- - What's he carrying the documents in? - Briefcase. But he's floating in the water. Has he got it in his hand, or what? What about one of those things that bank messengers have? Goes around the waist, comes down the sleeve and clips onto the briefcase. Get one, and we'll see. And he'll have to have a wallet, money, wristwatch. - George. - Hmm? I think we're attacking this the wrong way round. Wallet, money, wristwatch, they're all right and necessary. But, after all, he must have had some private life. There ought to be something more intimate on him when they find him. Personal things like photographs or maybe some private letters. I'll tell you what. He'd better have a girlfriend with a love letter from her. That's a good idea, but we'll have to make it really convincing. Hmm. We'll get Pam to write it for us. You wouldn't mind, would you? Would you have a go at it, Pam? I'll do anything I can to help with the work, sir. - Hang on a minute. I'll be back. - Okay, sir. I won't come up, Lu. There isn't time. All right. Good-bye, Joey. Now, remember, you're my girl now. Official. I won't ever forget. Victoria Station. Hi, Pam. How goes it? Little bit tired. Pam, I've got some news for you... and maybe it's going to make you angry. Tell me later, Lucy, when I've done this. Okay. I'll go make some coffee. It's already done. It's on the hot plate. That's what I like about you - you're so inefficient. - You want some? - No, thanks. "Dearest Willie"? Have you ever tried writing? That's the greatest opening I've ever heard in my life. Don't fool. It isn't a real letter. It's just something I've got to do. Love letters are always something you've got to do. What's it for then? It's part of a story I've got to make up. Well, let me help you. I'm completely undiscovered and cheap. My work, I mean. - What's the story? - Oh, it's very ordinary. They've just got engaged. He's going off on a dangerous job... and she's writing to him. Oh, that one. It's the start that's sticking me. "Dearest Willie - " His name's Willie Martin. "It was lovely seeing you. " Willie Martin. What a name. "Dearest Willie. " Take dictation. Darling... when you went away tonight... something went with you. I think it must have been my heart... because now I'm cold and empty. It's always bad when you go away... but it was worse tonight... because the day was so good. You shouldn't have bought the ring... and I knew you shouldn't. And you did because you love me... and I let you because I love you. There isn't much more than that to be had from any day. I won't wear it, darling. I told you I wouldn't. Because if I did... that would mean that you were real... that you belonged to me... and that they couldn't take you away from me... whereas now they can send you away... and leave me to wonder if I'll ever see you again... or whether I may wake up... and find I'd dreamed you. Maybe there'll be a time when it's all over... and you're still there and real and lovely. Then I'll put your ring on and wear it... and wear it until I die. Oh, God, darling, take care of yourself. As if you ever could or would. I suppose I mean... O God, take care of you. I love you. I love you. This is really wonderful, Pam. I had no idea you were a writer. - I'm afraid I didn't do it, sir. - Oh? A friend of mine did it. I only altered a word here and there. That's why I've signed it Lucy. - You didn't tell her anything. - Of course not. - She did it just for fun? - Yes, sir. - Just for fun. - Good. - Oh, George, have you seen this? - Yes. - I always told you there were hidden depths. - Mr. Acres, I have- Never mind, my dear. It happens to the nicest people. Oh, by the way, I fixed the letter from the bank about Willie's overdraft. The manager was very helpful. - I told him just enough. - Fine. Tell me, does this alleged girlfriend of yours wear thick spectacles? No. - Reasonably good to look at? - Very. Ah, then we want her photograph for Willie's wallet. - It doesn't have to be her photograph. - Oh, don't spoil it, Monty. I want to see this passionate Lucy creature. What are you doing? It's got to look as though it's been in his pocket for several days. Can we get a snap of this girl? - I should think so, sir. - Good. Now about dates. There's got to be something on him that will show when he left. I think I can fix to get a receipted bill from the Naval and Military Club. He stayed there on his last night. And he went to the theater. Final celebration. He has the stubs of the tickets in his pocket. two theater tickets for the night of... April 22. - Dress circle. - Make it four. And for something worth seeing. And what's going on in that bright little mind? You've got to buy the tickets anyway, and Willie can't use them. We might as well. There are three of us already, and with Pam's alleged girlfriend- I understand, dear chap. Mmm. Make it four. I've hacked it about a bit, as we agreed. It now reads, "General, the Honorable Sir Harold R.O.G. Alexander. "My dear Alex, I am taking advantage of this opportunity... "to send you a personal letter by hand of one of Mountbatten's officers... to put you in the picture regarding our intention in the Mediterranean. " - Good. - Then comes the personal stuff. Then, "The plan is that the 5th and 56th divisions will be reinforced... and form the main force for the attack on Greece. " Then a lot about possible landing points. Then, "In the western Mediterranean... "the heavy bombardment of Sicily will continue... "as it is necessary to make the enemy think... that this island is still our main objective. " - That's exactly right, sir. - And the rest as we had it before. Well, here you are. Let's hope it foxes them. - I won't touch it, sir, if you don't mind. - Why? I want only two sets of fingerprints on it - yours and your secretary's. - What do you want me to do with it then? - Fold it, sir. As sharp folds as you can. Now put it in the envelope. Now, if you'll wrap a piece of paper around it so that I can handle it... I'll take it out to your secretary and get her to seal it. - Thank you, sir. - Any more chores? No, thank you, sir. And thank you very much. Thank you. - Sorry I'm late. Got his clothes? - It's there. - Good. Where's Adams? - He's gone down. All ready, Mr. Adams? Yes, sir. Identity disks. Underwear. - Laundry marks fixed? - Yes. Socks and shirt. - This is new. - He just bought half a dozen at Gieve's. - I've got the bill to put in his pocket. - Right. Collar and tie. Awkward doing this on somebody else. Let me, sir. Now the uniform. Trousers. Things in the pockets first, or after they're on him? After. Blouse. Shoes. Not bad. The crowns on his shoulders look a bit new. He's just been promoted. The marks are still there where his captain's pips were. Right. Get the Mae West and the trench coat. Now the personal effects. - One wristwatch. - Right. Wallet containing one five-pound note, three one-pound notes... letter from bank manager re overdraft... book of stamps, photograph of fianc?e. Correct. Ten shillings in loose change to go in right-hand trouser pocket. Correct. Letter from fianc?e to go next to wallet. Correct. Bill for six shirts from Gieve's, Piccadilly... and receipted bill for a room at the Naval and Military. Correct. Two stubs of tickets to the Prince of Wales Theater. Correct. Cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys. Correct. Combined Operations pass and naval identity card in cellophane container. - Correct. - Briefcase. - I'll fasten the trench coat and Mae West, sir. - Thank you, Adams. Apart from the cover stuff already in there... letter from General Nye to General Alexander. Right. Letter to General Eisenhower from Admiral Mountbatten. Right. - Shouldn't he have the key? - He already has one on his key ring. Well... I think Major Martin is ready to go to war. 10:00. We'll have to keep up a steady average to make it. - Thank you, Adams. - Thank you. Attention! If you can manage the launching of the body... with only officers on deck, do so. The fewer people in the know the better. Better all round. Sailors are a superstitious lot. What's your cover story for the crew? I put it round that the canister contains a special sort of secret weather-reporting buoy. Well, I think that's the lot. - And the very best of luck. - Thank you. We'll try and do a good job for you. Carry on, Number One. - Ah, there we are. - No sherry, no whiskey, no gin, no rum. - Well, what's this? - Egg flip. I think my alleged friend wants a light. Why am I always your "alleged" friend? - George has never been quite sure you exist. - Oh, I exist, all right. - That's about all I do. - There's no doubt about that. This is very interesting. From his attitude in the office, one would never suspect George was such a fast worker. You should see him in the typist's office. George, I think we ought to drink to the major. - Oh, we must. - Yes. He's the chap who got us the seats. He couldn't come. Well, I don't know the major, but I'm quite sure he won't mind me drinking to his health. He's probably a grand boy. Let's drink the health of all the majors and all the commanders... and all the lieutenants. The major. May he have a safe and successful journey. - The major. - The major. - Steady as you go. - Steady, sir. Course. 2-7-2, sir. All right, my beauties. Not long now. Sixty feet. Fifty-five feet, sir. Fifty feet, sir. Forty-five feet. - Forty feet. - Okay, Sub. Get going. - Aye-aye, sir. - Thirty-five feet, sir. Up periscope. Thirty feet. Twenty-five feet, sir. Blast those fishermen. Haven't they got any homes? Down periscope. Stand by to surface. Check main vents. Open all L.P. master blowers. Check main vents. Open all L.P. master blowers. Canister party on casing. Tackle! - Hooked up! - Take the weight! Steady. Steady does it. Back down. Right up. Boats. Dinghy first. Unto Almighty God we commend the soul of this, our brother departed... and we commit his body to the deep. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. - Blessed be the name of the Lord. - Amen. All right, chaps. Come on. Canister party back on casing. Canister party on casing. All right. Down below. - ?Es ingl?s? - S?, se?or. Entonces creo lo mejor hacerme cargo de aquello. Eso es imposible, se?or. Primero ha de ser reconocido oficialmente. - 9-8-7. - Yes. - Montagu? - Yes. This is D.N.I. Scramble, will you? I've got a bit of news for you. The major's arrived. I've just received a signal. The vice-consul at Huelva is very worried. He says the body carried what looked like an official briefcase... and he's pulling every string to retrieve it. Let's hope he doesn't pull too hard, sir. Yes. But I think it might help to keep the ball rolling if I make a signal... telling him to get hold of it at all costs. If it was genuine, that would be the natural thing to do, wouldn't it? Good. Meantime, I'll put Major Martin in the casualty lists. - That's the first thing they'll check. - Right. Amen. Amen. Amen. I called on the magistrate before the funeral. All Major Martin's belongings have been returned. - And the briefcase? - Yes, and the briefcase. Good. Well, that's a bit of a blow. Either Lawrence was too efficient or the Nazis were too dumb. The lazy, incompetent beggars. Doesn't anything ever penetrate those Prussian skulls? The net result of Operation Mincemeat so far... seems to be that we've lost two bob. Everything else is horribly intact. Of course, sir, there are ways of opening letters... apart from using a knife with marmalade on it... and ways of closing them again. I'd like to hear what the scientific boys have to say. Agreed. - Well? - Course, this has been in water. Yes? - Seawater. - Yes. It makes it very difficult when things have been in water, particularly seawater. - Well, can you tell us anything? - I'm afraid very little. You see, when the thing's been in water, seawater, it obscures so much. - But do you think it's been opened? - Opened? Oh, yes, it's been opened. Oh, yes, it's been opened. It has been opened? And closed again by somebody who knows his business. It's been stretched out on a flat surface and held lightly at the corners... probably to be photographed. - I only wish I could be more helpful. - You've done splendidly. That's all we had to know. Well? - Mincemeat swallowed whole. - Mincemeat? Well? There's nothing new from Madrid, Herr Admiral. The f?hrer has told his conference that the documents... are undoubtedly genuine. - You mean he doesn't doubt them. - He's quite sure. The f?hrer, of course, has certain advantages... over mere intelligence officers like you and me, Frederik. He has his intuition... whereas we have to rely on our brains. - And he's sure God is on his side. - But you are not? I do not believe that God is on my side to the extent... of handing me the enemy's plans. There's no way in which we can check the genuineness of these papers. Those certainly appear to be Nye's and Mountbatten's signatures. The question is whether what is in the letters is true. And only the people who wrote them could tell us. But we can do something... to check the genuineness of the bearer. In what sense, Herr Admiral? We know a great deal about the lamented Major Martin, Frederik. We know the address of his club, of his bank. We even know about his debts. I think someone had better ask a few discreet questions in London... just to make sure there was such a man. - From Dublin, Mr. O'Reilly? - That's right. - How long are you staying? - Uh, three days. - London? - Yeah. - Business? - Yes. - All right. Thank you. - Thank you. - Is this all your luggage? - Uh, yes. - Will you read this notice, please? - I have. - Have you any articles subject to duty? - No. All right. I'll open this one up. All right. Thank you. Shut it up again. Is this all your luggage, madam? Will you read this notice, please? Do you have any articles subject to duty? Will you drive me to Number 57 Landsmere Gardens, please? 57 Landsmere Gardens? All right. Step in. I trust you had a pleasant journey. I am here with thee and thy goats. - Where from? - Dublin. If you look over your head, you'll see a plate with a telephone number. Memorize it, but don't write it down. If it's absolutely necessary, but not otherwise... ring that number for a cab to pick you up outside the south entrance... to the tube station at Hyde Park Corner. Go straight there and wait for me. But don't ring unless it's important. You're not under my orders. I'm not responsible for you, and I have troubles enough of my own. My instructions simply are to meet you and deliver you and your luggage. That's all. I doubt if I shall bother you much. It's nothing to do with me, but why were you chosen for this job? Because I'm so fond of the English. Yes, they are a loveable people. Hey.! Your other bag, sir. - Thank you. - Three and sixpence on the clock, sir. Thank you, sir. Jolly good luck, sir. - Uh, yes? - My name's O'Reilly. I believe you have a room for me. - Oh, you're the gentleman from Dublin? - That's right. - Oh, yes. Of course. Will you come in, please? - Thank you. Well, I'll take you straight up, shall I? Give me one of your cases. Oh, I can manage. - Never let it be said I let a lady carry for me. - Oh, you're all the same. I always say there's nobody like the Irish for manners. My granddad was Irish. He came from the north. But as he said, "What does it matter, north or south? We're all Irish, and all the Irish are kings' sons. " Now, look, I've put you on the first floor here. That's the bathroom and the necessary, and this is your room. I do hope you'll be comfortable. I expect you'd like a cup of tea, wouldn't you? I can make you one quite easily. Oh, no, thank you. I'll just get on and unpack my things. Oh, the blackout. Oh, you will be careful about the blackout, won't you? Do you know I had the police round three times about it last week? Oh, don't worry. I'll be very careful. Well, I'll leave you to yourself now. Oh, I almost forgot. In case you should want to be out late in the evening, I'll put the key on the hall table. And if there's anything else you want, just call "coo-ee" over the banisters and I'll pop up. Thank you. Polar... bear. Polar... bear. Stand by tonight. Well, the tie. The darkish blue goes with this suit. Yes, with pinstripes right through it, if we can. Thank you very much, sir. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Uh, um, I'd like some khaki shirts, please. - Made to measure or ready-made, sir? - Ready-made. - Collar size? - Sixteen. I think you'll like these, sir. They're very fine poplin. Practically prewar quality. - Oh, yes, yes. They're very nice indeed. - It's a beautiful shirt, sir. - But they're not really the ones I had in mind. - No, sir? No, you sold some to a friend of mine a few weeks ago. Um, Major William Martin of the Royal Marines. - They were cotton with separate collars. - I know the one you mean. Just take a look at those, will you, sir? Separate collars. Cotton. - Oh, good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Won't keep you a moment. - Right. - Yes, these look like the ones. - Good, sir. But I'm not quite sure. Uh, would it be troubling you too much to look up Major Martin's account- Look, sir, if your friend got his shirts from us... and if they were cotton with separate collars, those are certainly the ones. - We haven't any others in stock. - Oh. Well, I'll not doubt the word of an honest man. - I'll take two. - Thank you very much, sir. - So I said to this chap, if you can't let us have- - Excuse me. - Is this the Naval and Military Club? - Yes, that's right. - Thank you. - Well, you might as well scrap the whole idea. I wonder if you could help me. I wonder if you could help me. I'll do my best, sir. I'm looking for a friend of mine, Major Martin. Major William Martin of the Royal Marines. I believe he's a member here. Do you happen to have seen him lately or know his whereabouts? Major Martin. There's a Major Martin who's a gunner, sir. No, that'd hardly be him. He's in the Royal Marines. - Eh? - The Royal Marines! I don't think I know the gentleman personally, sir. Is he a regular officer or temporary? Oh no, there I couldn't be sure. If he's a temporary, I probably shouldn't know him, sir. There's a lot of members now that I don't know. "Martin, Brigadier A.T." "Martin, Captain L." "Martin, Major W., R.A." No, sir. No Major Martin what's a marine here, sir. - Now, surely that's odd if he's a member. - Eh? - Surely that's odd if he's a member! - Not necessarily, sir. What with the bomb damage and no staff, we're a bit behind with things these days. If he's a new member, he may not be on the file yet. You could leave a message. Then if he comes in, I'll personally see he gets it. No, thanks. It can wait. - I'm grateful to you, all the same. - Eh? I'm grateful to ya, all the same! Oh. Thank you, sir. This is the manager's secretary. Speaking. Who is it, please? Thank you. Will you hold on a moment, please? There's the contract you asked for. And there's a Mr. Phillips who'd like to speak to you on the phone. - What does he want? - He's making inquiries about a Major Martin. - About who? - A Major Martin. Put him through. Stay on the line and get a shorthand note of what we say. Yes, Mr. Emberton. Switchboard. - There's a call on my outside line. - Yes, sir? - Get through to the exchange and have it traced. - Yes, sir. - Hello. - Is that the manager? Speaking. I - I wonder if you could help me. My name is Phillips, and I'm making some inquiries about Major William Martin. - Yes? - I believe he was a customer of yours. Only the poor fellow's dead, and as an old friend... I'm trying to help clear up his affairs. I see. Well, I'm sure you'll understand it's an absolute rule of the bank not to discuss a client's affairs... with anyone but his accredited representatives. Certainly not on the telephone. But I am onto the right branch, I take it. I should have thought the best thing would be if you could drop in and see me. I'm pretty full up this morning, but this afternoon's all right... if you'd like to come in at, say, quarter past 2:00 and ask for me. Yes. Yes, I suppose that would be a good idea. - A quarter past 2:00. - Yes. All right. You were very smart to get this, Mr. Emberton. My secretary often takes notes of important calls. You say he had a slight accent? Yes, but, uh, not a foreign accent, if you follow me. It's difficult to tell on the telephone. I should have said he was English, but possibly from the west country. - Did you trace the call? - It came from a public telephone booth. Obviously, yet when you suggested an appointment, he agreed. He agreed, but he didn't sound particularly enthusiastic. Is there any chance that this might be a coincidence? William Martin is quite a common name. He may have just mistaken the bank. - It's possible, but- - But not probable. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Emberton. You've handled the whole thing beautifully. Frankly, I don't think the man will turn up. However, we can't afford to take any chances. We'll both be back at 2:00. - I'll be waiting for you. - Thank you. - He's a good chap. - Very good. Look, George, if there's somebody around who can ring up Willie Martin's bank... it means that Jerry?s putting the whole thing under a microscope. Now, where, if anywhere, is there a weak link? I'm going to Scotland Yard to talk to General Colbourne of the special branch. Of course, a voice from a telephone booth isn't much of a starting point. I realize that, sir. I wondered whether you'd had any ripple on the waters recently that might give us a line. I don't think so. There's a gentleman just arrived from Sweden we're rather interested in... but he's nothing to do with your Major Martin. It's certain he won't come to the bank, but we'd better have a couple of your men just in case. Yes, of course. We must certainly be in on it. We always like to make a new friend if we can. Besides, you may be wrong. He may turn up. My guess is that he's only over here for this one job. He knows we haven't got our tabs on him. He's the sort of man who might take chances. - A washout. - Yes, sir. - We'll get back and stand by. - Right. Pity. Do you think he suspected Emberton? I don't know, but it's obvious he can't afford to show himself. - Hello? - Is that the American Library? - Yes. - Can I speak to Miss Sherwood, please? Just a moment. Lucy, it's for you, and you really must get him to ring up out of working hours. I'm sorry. I'll tell him. Hello? Hello, Joe? Lucy, this is Larry. - Hello, Larry. - You know why I'm phoning, don't you, Lu? Sure. Sure. Oh, no, he's gone. I guess I knew it would come. Thank you, Larry. You all right? Yes, he was a good flyer. Thank you for ringing, Larry. Would you check this book out, please, miss? Lucy.! Lucy? Good evening. I'm sorry to disturb you, but the door was open. Yes. What do you want? I'm making some inquiries about a friend of mine, William Martin. - William Martin? - Yes. - Yes, will you come in? - Thank you. Won't you sit down? Willie's death was a great shock to me. Yes, it was a great pity. Forgive me, but I take it you're not his fianc?e. No. I hardly knew him. Only I understood he'd just recently become engaged... and that his fianc?e lived at this address. That's why I came. Yes, well, that's the girl who lives here with me - Lucy Sherwood. Oh, will you have a cigarette? Thank you. Lucy Sherwood. That's right. I remember. I'll get you a light. I should have liked to see her. - I'm afraid she's out tonight. - When will she be back? Not until late, but if you could come again tomorrow... I'd say that you'd called and that you'd be coming back. Yes. I knew Willie right from the time when he was a boy in Cardiff. Did he come from Cardiff? I didn't know. Is his fianc?e very upset? Well, naturally. Well, I don't want to take up your time... but I do want to - to do everything I can to help. So if you would like to give his fianc?e my name and address- - Your address? - Yes. Perhaps you'd care to take it down. My name is Patrick O'Reilly. R- E-I-double L- Y. And my address is 57 Landsmere Gardens... North West 1. I am to be found there any time. Right. Oh. Sorry. Don't mind me. I'm just passing through. You're Miss Lucy Sherwood? That's right. Well, go on. Where's your manners, Pam? Introduce your handsome friend. - Lucy, this is Mr. Patrick O'Reilly. - Hello there. Mr. O'Reilly is making inquiries about Willie Martin. Willie Martin? Willie Martin. Dearest Willie? It's no good making inquiries about him, mister. Willie Martin doesn't exist. At least he's dead, which is the same thing. That's right, isn't it? That's true. He's dead, so he doesn't exist. It's the same with all these boys. Here today, gone tomorrow. What's real about that? I was very sorry to hear of his death. Why should you be sorry? You weren't in love with him, were you? He didn't give you a ring. I never wore it. Now I never will. Ever.! Ever.! - Lucy. - I knew him in the old days in Cardiff. Did you, now? And I'll bet you knew his old man too. His ma and his sister and the whole shooting match. Well, I didn't. They were just photographs. The usual photographs with folks looking the way folks do. But I never knew 'em. In the time, I barely knew him. Three months. What sort of time's that? And yet I knew him well enough. And then they took him away from me... and killed him in the sea. "Down, down into the sea... to be lost evermore in the main. " Tennyson. Do you know Tennyson? Why should you? Why should I know Tennyson? He almost made it. Darling, I dreamed you. I was always afraid I had. Always afraid. Lucy, darling, I really think you ought to go to bed. Bed? What for? There's plenty of time to go to bed. Years and years with nothing else to do and nowheres else to go. And everything cold and ended. Oh, why can't you all go away and let me alone? - Is she all right? - Yes, I think so. But I really must get her to bed. I'm sorry I've intruded. You have my address. Yes. Lucy. Lucy. Polar... bear. Polar... bear. Martin probably... genuine... but to be certain... have deliberately... revealed... my identity... to enemy. Stand by... for confirmation... in one hour. But if no message... at that time... have been arrested... therefore... Martin false. Come on. - He had it all pat? - Yes, about Cardiff and everything. - Here's the address that he gave me. - What's he like? Tall, dark, Irish-sounding, good-looking, about 30. I'd like to get that description to General Colbourne. - May I use the phone? - It's in there. What chance that he believed you? I don't know. I wasn't very good. I wasn't ready for it. - But he believed Lucy. - You really think so? Yes. He believed her, all right. I saw his face. - To Lucy it was true. - For heaven's sake, don't start blubbering. - How long did he stay? - About 10 minutes. I told him it was Lucy that he wanted. And you didn't get anything out of him that would even give us a lead? Now, steady, Monty. She got his name and address. That wasn't too bad. I didn't even have to get that. He gave it to me. General Colbourne wants us to go round to this address and check. - He's sending more men. - Is there such an address? Oh, yes. It's a waste of time, but I don't see what else we can do. Don't worry. It's all right. - Leave one of your men to cover the apartment. - Right then. You lead. - Good night, George. - Cheerio, old boy. Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. I beg your pardon. Why should he bother to give Pam a phony address? Why? Why? Unless - George, I'm off my head. Stop the car. No, get after French and stop him. - Well, make up your mind. - Hurry, man! Hurry! Blow your horn, you idiot. Blow your horn. Let's stop rushing around like buffalo and use our brain, if we have any. Aren't I working for you anymore? What is all this? - What's the matter, sir? - French, we're making fools of ourselves. I'm inclined to agree with you, but Colbourne feels we shouldn't take any chances. - He thinks he might be there. - That's just the point. - He is there. I'm certain of it. - Shouldn't we get on? French, I want you to take your men to the house and cover it. Don't be spotted and don't do anything else until I tell you. - And if our man comes out, sir? - Don't worry about that. He won't. I'm quite sure he won't. Off you go, and, mind you, no action without further orders. - You don't want us to scoop him up? - That's exactly what I mean. I'm sorry, sir, but my orders from General- I don't give a damn what your orders are. You do as I say. - I'll talk to Gen. Colbourne. - Thank you very much, Commander. - French, you have my orders. Carry them out. - Yes, sir. Just a minute, sir. Before those orders go through, will you listen for one moment? Montagu, you're taking too much upon yourself. The man almost certainly isn't there, but if he is, he won't be there for long. - Every moment we waste- - Sir, he is there. Then why are you trying to countermand my orders? General Colbourne, if you send your men to the house... you will arrest one spy, and we may lose 30,000 men. I ask you to send French to cover the house and do no more... until I've had a chance to explain. - You're uncommonly sure of yourself. - I'm sure of nothing, sir. But I've used what few brains I have... and now I must stand by what they tell me. Your decision, sir. French, cover the house and wait for further orders from me. Yes, sir. - Well, now, Commander? - I'd prefer not to talk about it in the street, sir. What I'm asking you to assume, sir, is... that that address is genuine. - If so, what happens? - We pick him up. Suppose he doesn't mind that? People usually mind being shot. Suppose he's prepared to risk his life to be sure about Willie Martin. If we turn up at that address, it can only mean that we've been tipped off... and that the whole Martin story is a plant. This man will have committed suicide... but Jerry will know the answer... and our operation will be blown. I'm sorry, sir. We mustn't touch him. We daren't. You mean, till after we think he's got a message through. No, sir. Right up till the time of the landings. Because the fact that there have been no further messages from him might give the game away. You realize he'll probably be out of the country in a couple of days. Yes, and we must let him go. After all, he's done us no harm. Masterly inactivity. They also serve who only stand and wait. Polar... bear. Polar bear. Martin genuine. - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! Three batteries of heavy artillery. will leave Sicily for Sardinia. - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! The 1st Panzer Division will proceed to Greece with all speed. - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! Six flotillas of R-Boats will leave Sicily for the Aegean. - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! - Martin genuine! Lieutenant Commander, the Honorable Ewen Montagu... Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Lieutenant Commander John Adams... Royal Navy. Lieutenant Commander David Hebden... Royal Navy. Can you assure me, Commander Montagu... as an officer and a gentleman... that this thing you are going to do is good... and worthy of him... that if I agree to your request... my son's body will be treated decently and with respect... and that finally he will have Christian burial? Last night I dreamed... a deadly dream. Beyond the Isle of Skye... I saw a dead man win a fight... and I think that man was I.
