How many? Six or seven, maybe eight. Can't you count? They're not exactly all together, sir. Well, where are they? They're here, it's just, well, not everything is attached, sir. We're short a few parts. Parts? This way, sir. - Think I got a shoe over here in the bush. Oh, Jesus Christ! Put a lid on this as of now. Yes, sir. We'll cordon off the area, sir. Let me talk to the survivors. There's only one left. Only one? My God, it's happening all over again! He claims to be the writer, and he's still somewhat in shock. MT. Lyman? This is Chief Deyner. What's going on here? I don't know. We were just making a movie. A movie? There are seven- Or eight. Or eight corpses layin' out there. What the hell kind of movie was it? I don't know, I usedta know, but. Did anyone know they were here? I want every available man here, now! Josh, I'm sorry, I- I couldn't see through the makeup. I thought it was Oliver. Yeah, well, Oliver's over here, where he's supposed to be. Who the hell is that? Uh, Steven Blake, I was told to come to the set. To the set, not on it. Blake's the real cop I told you about. He investigated the real murders here. Ah, OK. Uh, Mr. Blake, I believe you're gonna be one of our technical advisors, and technical advisors belong behind the camera. Freddie, let's go! Quiet, let's do it again! Oliver, your agent's on the phone. Oh, Josh, Freddie. Take 10, everybody, 10. Josh, uh, I've got another scene. No, Arthur, no. Look, it has pace. It's not the movie I'm making. OK, but I like this movie. Peter? Oh, Harry. Your interview with that movie magazine. Mm, terrific. They're on hold. - Listen, have you found me any local bimbos yet? Not yet. Well, stay on it, who is this? Her name is Sally Evans. Hello, Sally, Harry Sleerik. Harry Sleerik, I'm the producer. No, this film is nothing like Babysitter Basher. Yeah, it was a good little movie. Uh-huh, oh, absolutely, this film will be done in good taste. That's cold! - Don't touch it, don't touch it, just let it dry. Josh, we're ready. Tell me those aren't great. - Robbie, there will be no exploding tit shot! Look, Harry specifically- Oh, I can imagine what Harry said. Are those yours. No, he made 'em for me. Too bad. - OK, look, at least let me tear the nipple off. Jesus, think of the audience. Do you think my mother could watch that? I don't know, what's she like? I want subtle. This, this is not subtle! Don't do that! Don't worry, you'll get used to it. How long's it take? Oh, 'bout as long as it takes to digest the caterer's donuts. Watch it, hey here, hold this, huh? - Yes, terrible murders and mutilations. When'd you find this guy? - About five minutes ago, look, Josh, I may be wrong- I like that, where is he? Freddie said you canceled the motel rooms. - Uh, excuse me a minute, production emergency. Too expensive, everyone stays right here. There's plenty of room. - So we're gonna be working and living here. That's just like camp! - You're gonna turn this into an asylum, Harry. Josh, it's nostalgia, didn't you ever wanna go back to high school, see what it'd be like? No, no, not really. Hey, Josh, I got the lead in the series! Hey, that's great, what is it? - Oh, it's an action adventure with some humor. Kind of a ripoff of Miami Vice and Moonlighting. Great, when does it start? Tomorrow. Tomorrow, hey, Oliver, you got, you got four more weeks here! Josh, this is a series. Hey, Oliver, this is a movie! Yeah, a low budget movie. Now, you can't do this to me! We got a contract. We can sue. No, ya can't, that takes money. Josh. No, Arthur, no. - The high school's been closed down ever since. Now, listen, Sally, I think you should know just one more fact for the article. The murderer was never caught nor even identified. Sally, I really gotta go, I'll look forward to reading it. And, by the way, it was really nice talking to you, Sally. Sure, you, too, have a nice day. Peter, Peter! Peter! Yeah, Harry? Don't you hear me, what, do I stutter? Listen, I wanna guarantee a good interview. Prime the pump a little. Have Sally Evans a little thank you, OK. Yeah, check her out. If she's a looker, send the douchebag some flowers. If she's fat, just dump some candy on her. - OK. - Yeah. Peter! Yeah, Harry? Corned beef on rye, lean! Got it. Peter! Not from the truck! Not from the truck. Keep in touch, Harold. I hope they cancel your series, Oliver. Scumface! Actors. Be cool, Callie. Gonna be a star, Oliver? Gonna try. Yeah, right. - Arthur, I want you to write a great, sexy scene for Janine here. You're gonna have a big career ahead of you, honey. You got great tits, they're fake, but who has to know. You like me? - All right, that's it, hold it right there! What the hell is that? Hello? Is anybody here? Hey, wait up! Hey, listen, could you tell me how to get out of here? I thought this was the way to the parking lot. What's goin' on? Jesus. - You see, Oliver's gone off to better things. It's a real crusher, but, we've lost him in this picture. I mean, you won't catch me holding him back. I mean, he's got a career out there, and, and I'm happy for him. But he was playing you, so this is really a stroke of good fortune, and I believe in signs. Yeah, but I've never done this before. Hey, you'll be more natural that way! You remember Mr. Kastleman, the principal, and Amos, the custodian? Well, they're gonna be playing themselves, also! Are you sure this is a good idea? Pff, it was the director's idea, part of his documentary background, loves realism. Hey, George! Great having you on the crew, doin' a helluva job. Couldn't do it without ya! Guy's such a moron, so slow. Brain damage, you know, but you're gonna be terrific, I feel it! I can't- No, you're gonna be great! Well, if you think I can handle it. Pff, trust me. Harry, Harry, Oliver's leaving. Ah, don't worry about that scumbag. Couldn't act for shit anyway, I gotcha a new star. You're not gonna believe it, tailor-made! Harry, you OK? Yeah, trust me. - I mean, who are we talkin' for this? Ah, over here. Steven, this is our director, Josh Forbes, huh? Uh, we've met. Harry, do you got a minute? He's a cop! Just what you need! - I need an actor, Harry! - This is better, this is reality! Think of the publicity. Think of the bad scenes. Bad scenes, good scenes, publicity gets 'em into the theater! But they're gonna hate the movie! Not if you give 'em more tits and blood. The film's about people, Harry, people, not body parts! - That's right, people like Steven Blake, he'll be great! - Josh, Dillon needs you to check out the lens selection. Trust me! Josh? I just got my contracts, Harry, and your oily signature was not on it. Oh, don't worry about that! Your, your agent and I have been friends for over 1O years. What does that say about my agent? Oh, Steven Blake, I want you to meet Miss Callie Cassidy, your leading lady. You two should get acquainted. Tomorrow, you're gonna have to ball her brains out in Technicolor. Ciao. Ever the poet. I'm, uh, I'm not really an actor. - Oh, well, I'm not really an actress either. I've got three films to prove it. That was a joke. Oh, I'm sorry, I, uh. Yeah. So, what was it? The place just felt weird! We knew no one ever found the killer, and we did a lot of night shooting. There aren't a lot of lights in that school. You just felt there was something out there in all that darkness. Yeah, you're right about that. Then there was that squeaking sound. It just kept coming. Closer and closer and closer. Oh my God! That sheet is moving! - Where? - Over there! My God, one of them's still alive! Check for a pulse. I thought that was a girl's body! Uh, it is, sir. But that's a man's arm! I know, uh, I, some of the bodies were pretty torn up, sir, uh, I guess we got some of the parts mixed up. Heh, the arm just rolled off. What are we up against? Who could've done all this? What kind of a wh-weapon did they use? No, no, it-it's been done before. I need something else, something new! OK, but we've got other problems. Robbie wants to know if you can give him more time on the severed head. Wh-what's wrong? - The eyeballs don't work, he needs to get 'em to bulge out a little more, take a look. Hey-hey-hey, how you doin', Amos? I'm gon' be a movie star! Should be fun. Man said just act natural, be cool! You always were a cool cat. Oh, I remembers you, too, Stevie Blake when you went here, you was always nice to me. Not like them others, though. - So what're you gonna do with your newfound fame? I'm gonna do some of them pussy films! Pornos? Yeah, yes I was! _ Why? - Got 1O inches strapped to the leg right here, just raring to g0 g Been moppin' floors too long, too long, Stevie! Too long! Too long, Stevie! Excuse me? Mr. Kastleman? Yes. I don't mean to disturb you, but I understand that you were the principal here when this whole thing happened. Yes, yes. - Well, you see, I'm trying to get a handle on my character, you know, what she was like and, uh, what was she like? Oh, she, she was, she was a good student. She, until that Farley boy- - Look, I'm sorry if this whole thing bothers you, remembering and all. - Well, that's all about all I do now is remembering. I just remember all the time. I can imagine. You can? I wonder if you really can imagine. - You, you see that table over there in the corner, hmm? Ordinary corner, isn't it? Till, till I saw a nose nailed to the floor right over there. And a t-t-tongue lying right there. Eyeballs, eyeballs dangling from strings, staring at me right there, and that closet, would you like, would you like to use your imagination and see if, see if you can use your imagination. Just, just open up the door there. Look right in there, don't be afraid, just, just use your imagination. ' God! - Don't touch it, don't touch anything! " You jerk! " Me? That was rigged for the skin to rot away on cue when the doors were opened. It's over 3O feet of wiring in here to 15 different circuits and, four vials of my special homemade pus. Robbie, that is disgusting! - I'm not talking about baking cookies here, Madam Girl Scout, it takes over an hour to stir this stuff to the right consistency. You should spend as much time on your face as I spent on this one! You know, if she's not gonna appreciate what I'm doing, she shouldn't be here. Do you have any idea how long it takes to get this stuff to work just right? Not as long as it took that murderer to chop up that poor student. I remember them, every one of them. Sheri! - Tag team, two out of three falls, right, Sheri? Oh, got any underwear on today, Sheri? Back off, asshole! Hey, c'mon, man, chill out, all right'? I didn't know you two got married. Thanks, Farley. ' MY hero! Uh, later, OK? OK. Oh, pain, doctor! Yo, please don't tell me you're goin' out with the team mascot, come on, Fars? Hey-hey, pussy on wheels pal, I call, she comes, but, uh, not for you, cutie. It's your ticket, man. If you can handle the traffic. Now that, over there, is more my speed. That's what I call Mount Olympus, man, and as far as I know, nobody's reached the top yet. No problem. You don't stand a chance, Casanova. - Whoa, I feel a little wager comin' on there, pal. Oh, a wager, what do you think, Jimmy, 5O bucks, something like that? Yeah, I'd say 50. You got it, 50. I'll even throw in the wet panties as proof. Hey, beautiful, I'm talkin' to you! Wait a second, all right? Did you want me? I'm Richard Farley, quarterback. Oh, really! What's your name? Sarah, Sarah Walker. - Well, Sarah, seems like today's your lucky day. I want you to come and watch me. Here's a special pass to the game. Oh, well, thank you very much. I appreciate the thought, but I really do have other plans, Richard. Uh, just hold on there! What are you doing in here? - I don't know what kind of a guy you think I am, but, uh, I just don't give these passes to every girl that walks in off the streets. - I really have no idea what kind of guy you are. All I want is your phone number! Nsst, now I know. She's walkin' away! Get him outta here! Can't I just call ya? I'm late and you're in my way! Tomorrow night, say, uh, seven o'clock. I'll pick ya UP- ' No! All right. Wow, what are you doing, let me down! - Either you say yes or I'm gonna take Becky out in the hallway naked. ' Sarah! All right. Nice view, huh? Very nice. It gets better. This place has good vibes! Ah, good air. So, uh, whatta you think? About what? About me. I haven't really given it much thought. Well, that's all right. We have all night long. - I think that I should be getting home now. You know, uh, I lost it up here. Really, well, thank you for sharing that moment with me. May we go now? We just got here! It's late. Will you lighten up a little? Did anyone ever tell you what a bitchin' bod ya have? It's time for me to go now, Richard, or is it Dick? I am serious! - Listen, I just spent 17.50 plus tip on dinner. You didn't buy me! A guy's gotta get somethin'. - Well, that is all you're getting from me, now, I am going home even if I have to walk. Oh, so you want me to work for it? What are you doing? Now, listen, I've been watching you pushin' through those clothes all night long. You can't lead a guy on and not deliver! Lead you on? Nobody hits one of the Trokes! This coulda been fun, now come here! Now I'm gonna show you what 17.50 plus tips is worth! Now you're gonna see me score right between the uprights! ' Stop it! - We gotta see her tits, are they in the picture? Where's the frame line? What in the hell? Jesus Christ, Harry! - [Harry Gimme a break, Josh, we gotta see some flesh! That's it, no more! Next thing you guys are probably gonna wanna do is ice my nipples to make 'em stick out! Why are women always the ones to be exploited? What is it with you guys'? Hey, I'm having a great time! Oh, really? Well, would you if you had to walk around this scene with your schlong hanging out? Only in your case, darling, it would be a shlort! Come on, Callie, it's a movie! Bullshit! You know what happens to movies? People see them, it seeps into their minds. Everything we do plants a seed. The fuck is she talkin' about? I am talking about the necessity of this scene, Harry! Look, ya gotta know, she was raped. You don't have to show it to know it! Who the hell wants to hear about it? It is degrading to women! It sells tickets! Well, it shouldn't! - If they keep seeing 'em, I'll keep makin' 'em! No, no, I am sorry. There is nothing redeeming about this shit! This could be trouble, Arthur. - Well, I didn't want to write the scene this way! Told me you were trying to say something with this picture! Maybe we can kill off her character. Life as a Cuisinart? - Maybe we can rewrite some of this. - Cribbin' actresses, shoulda done an animated horror film. Harry, am I getting paid or what? Roy, what are you talking about? My check. You didn't get it'? No. Jesus Christ! I'm gonna fire that secretary! She can't do this to my crew, you guys are family! Look, I'll personally messenger the check to you. Can't trust the mail. Guys workin', what is this, charity? Jesus Christ! - Excuse me. - What? Mr. Sleerik, sorry. L - just wanted to thank you for letting me be a part of this picture. Ah, anytime, kid, you're a good actor. And I was thinking- Look, we'll talk. ' Great. Arthur? Your script got us into this and you're just gonna have to pull us out. But that isn't my script! I know she's a pain in the ass, but I need her to finish this picture. What she really needs is the old six inches behind the barn. I, I can't- I'm not asking you to do that, but you better write something redeeming. Well, what? A scene for Callie, I don't know. Two girls talk about love, marriage, babies. Babies? Yeah, make it poignant. Redeeming, you know, life is wonderful crap. Give me a lot of hope. Hope. - And set it in the locker room shower so they're naked. Things are gettin' crazy! What is it, is it me, is it the school? Ever since I got here, I don't feel right. No, no, wait a minute. Listen, remember when you were in high school, how you thought you'd never get out? Well, you're livin' and workin' here, it's kind of the same thing. No, that's not what I mean. I don't know, maybe it's that people actually died here. It was pretty gruesome. Before the incidents, had anything like this ever happened before? No, that's why it was such a shock. I mean, I grew up here. Crippen High defined normal. I mean, we did typically normal things. Look, I'll show ya. This is what you wanted to show me? Yeah. - An empty locker, that's very impressive. No, no no no no, look again, look. Steve and Cathy. Steve and Cathy? This was my locker. - A little heart complete with cupid's arrow! Blake, you're a softie! What do you mean, arrow? Isn't it just like a man to forget? No, I never drew that arrow. That wasn't there yesterday, either. That's a fresh scratch and it's right through my name. Huh, maybe, maybe there is something going on. Like what? Like whoever did the killings is back. Yeah, but why? Because they like it. Yo, Robbie, are you in here, man? Come on, bro, where do you want me to put this stuff, huh? Can't miss it here. Man. What the hell? Son of a bitch! Whoa! Yo, is that you, man? Hey, look, come here, you gotta check this out. Bro, is that you? My God! Help! Help! Help, help! No! That's what I call blood. Not that one little artistic drip you wanna see! I'm not gonna film it, Harry. Oh yes, you will, if you wanna get paid. It's crass, it's crude, it's- It's great entertainment! You see what's happening here, Arthur? Defend your script! I wanted to do a psychological thriller. You call this psychological? This is blatant abuse of the audience! - What abuse, everyone loves a good gross-out! Look, I'm tryin' to do a film that - Josh! Isolates the brittle edge of sanity. A simple, normal town plunged into a series of ghastly murders, why? How could it happen, they say. Nothing ever happens in this town. And there lies the thread, the thread that we follow. We follow it, Harry, to its horrifying revelation. And what is that? Oh, yes. What is that? - So, you never saw Cathy after the prom? No, she, uh, she just went away. Why? I don't know. We slept together that night, it was my first time. Then, she went away to her grandparents' place for summer vacation. When she didn't come back, I thought I'd done something terrible. I didn't sleep with another girl for three years after that. Uh, uh, that-that Robbie fella, he, he asked me to mop up. L- never seen such a mess. Must be shootin' some gruesome scenes. All right, let's clear this up. Freddie, uh, don't we have some new pages being Xeroxed? Where's Peter? Uh, there are three possibilities. Our, uh, our trusty production assistant either quit because of no pay, quit because of being Harry's whipping post, or, um, quit because of pressure to round up local bimbos. Tss, the body count rises. Hey, Dillon, didn't you tell anyone of the grips just, uh, disappeared, vanished? That's right. Took a walk down a dark hallway and that was all she wrote. None of this makes sense. We thought they were quitting! We know different now, don't we? No one heard the screams? Sure, but you just figured someone was rehearsing their lines! They were dropping like flies in there! How could ya not notice? On a low budget film, you just get so used to working with less, you expect a certain amount of attrition! Look, someone doesn't show up for work, somebody else doubles up on that job! See, we have one actress play three different characters. Just plopped on a new wig! But the blood, it was all over! - In a western, everything gets covered with dirt. Two days on this movie, everything I own was covered with blood! Harry wanted lots and lots of blood. I guess it just didn't take that much for the killer to just casually blend it all together. - There's nothing casual about any of this! I know. No one inside yet, sir. None that we could see. What the hell happened to you? There's blood everywhere! Slippery, just fell. I slid from Greenway's chemistry class all the way to Brosnahan's English. Found this, though. Where was it? The biology lab. What do you know about the biology lab'? - They changed every scene I wrote for that location. My stuff was butchered! - The animals we use in our dissections are dead, though preserved wholly intact, much like the specimens you see in these jars. As you can see, this rat is in a condition almost identical to that when it was first placed in the preserving solution. A solution known as formaldehyde. Now, we must be very careful when working with this solution because if inhaled, these vapors can produce quite an adverse reaction, as Mr. Porter will now demonstrate. Having a nightmare, Donny? Yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. - Well, that's because your gray matter was on holiday. You were sleeping in my classroom for the third time this week. I'm gonna have to find something very interesting for you, and I don't like doing that. Not for a worthless, sniveling- Uh, Mr. Birnbaum? Well, what have we here? Ah, your name is Susan? Yes, the lady in the office said that you might have room for another student. I just started here today, and all the other classes this period were full. Maybe I'll just go the library. - Oh, no no no, of course, we have room for you. Now, uh, let's see. Is anyone sitting there? Let's get back to formaldehyde. It's not just in this rat jar- Hi. Don Porter. Susie. If you ever need to borrow my notes or anything, just ask. We aren't all listening, are we? - Thanks. Porter! Porter, how could anyone be so pathetic. You're a freak of nature, Porter. Much like that dodo bird, too weak, too stupid, too ignorant to survive, so nature killed it off. Everyone, take a look at a soon-to-be-extinct species, the Donnybird. Chapter 17 for tomorrow's dissection examination. Uh, Susan. Susan, you have a lot of extra work to make up. - Yes, I'll start tonight, I'll catch up in no time. - Oh, I realize your good intentions, Susan, but, uh, I think you'll need some extra-curricular tutoring. - Tutoring, why, Mr. Birnbaum, I am a straight-A student. Ah, that was at another school, Susan. You'll find that I'm far more exacting. That's why I make myself available at night to my more promising students. Excuse me, I gotta talk to him. I'm busy right now, Miss McComb. Yeah, most of the time. Didn't used to be, though, not when you wanted me coming in at night. It's OK, I can wait. But how come I'm gettin' C's now instead of A's? Perhaps if you looked into the mirror, you could figure that out for yourself, Miss McComb. Would you like to drop another grade? You'd better buzz off. You want an A, too? Don't worry, he finishes fast. Susan? Uh, that's the warning bell. I think I better get going. Richard, Richard, this is Officer Blake, from the Crippen Police Department and he's investigating the death of that Farley boy and that, uh, cheerleader that- - Oh, yes, yes, Sheri Haines, uh, she was a lovely girl. Well, how can I help you? About the murders. Oh, yes, grisly affair. Reminds me of some of my students' sloppy dissection examinations. You, uh, told Principal Kastleman that you had some thoughts on who might've done this? Yes, yes, I believe I do. Well, anything would be appreciated. You know, this really isn't very accurate. I mean, Birnbaum didn't know anything! That's not the point, cut it. - Well, I thought that's what the scene was about. - The scene is about getting finished by 6:30. I have a crew that wants to go eat dinner! Yeah, what is for dinner? - Then, if there are no further interruptions, I'm gonna slip quietly into a hot tub and slit my wrists, thus providing Harry with more of his sought-after blood for this epic. Gate's clean, let's go again. We are making a movie! All other life ceases to exist. There is only the next scene, huh? Rana pipiens, the common field frog. Now, as you all can see, little Freddie is dead, very dead! Dead little Freddie, and in a few moments, you will all have the unique pleasure, as we try to discover what makes Freddie Freddie, as we split him open on your desks. If you ever want to be a coroner and carve up people- Are you OK? - You must first start with frogs. They're just little creatures! I can't! Porter, talking again? Would you like to share your vast wisdom with the whole class? L- may have to be excused. What, and miss all the fun? Mr. Birnbaum, Donny loves animals, he's very sensitive and- He's a scared little snot. What's the matter, Porter? Are you afraid to go poking around little Freddie? Well, that's what I'm here for, to inspire you. Now begin by inserting the scalpel. You'll have to separate the epidermis from the spinal column. And then the most rewarding part of this exercise. He will insert the scalpel past the chest wall and with his free hand, reach in, firmly grasping the heart, and tear it out. I can't! Let me do it, I know how! - No, he'll do it or he won't leave this class. Now, dig in. Susan? Is that you, Susan? Well, you just have a seat and I'll be right with you. I'm glad you've changed your mind about our tutoring sessions. Susan? Susan? Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were one of my students. As you all can see, little Freddie's dead! Very dead little Freddie! But that's what I'm here for, to inspire you. In a few moments, you will all have the unique pleasure as we split him open on your desks. As we all try to discover what makes Freddie, Freddie. J1 Come, you good children 41 Come and greet your teacher 41 Come and greet your teacher J1 Be what you learn J1 You start all over again J1 How could you ever think J1 About pleasure and pain J1 Come, you good children 41 Come and greet your teacher J1 Said all you good children 41 Come and greet your teacher J1 Now just stand in line J1 And wait for your turn J1 Was I the one you need 41 The one that you bum 41 Come and greet your teacher Did he really die that way? Best as we could piece together. Sorry, that's a bad choice of words. I'm scared! I think something's going on, all these people leaving, not showing up. - Well, I heard it was normal on a film like this. I don't feel normal about this! I just think there's somebody out there, waiting, and I wanna find him. Or her. Or it, first. - OK, let's write down what we know. How 'bout a list of names? Yeah, that's good. Anyone who you think is remotely connected. Hello, Sally, yeah, Harry. Yeah, listen, I just wanted to follow up on that interview. There's a few things I thought you might like to add. Well, it seems people are disappearing from my set! Yeah, crew members, some actors. Yeah, well, you know, I thought it was nothing at first, then I had remembered that you had mentioned in our first interview that you thought the murderer may still be out there somewhere! Yes, I think it could be a missing person. The police, huh, they don't know what to do. Let's clear for the camera. Where'd you get this? _ Hmm? Oh, that's my daughter, Cathy. Cathy Johnson? No, Cathy Kastleman. May I, please, thank you. No no no, wait a minute, this is my girlfriend from high school. Cathy Johnson. After all that- What's going on here? She used, uh, Johnson. Didn't want kids to know that her father was their principal. So where is she now? Away- But where? Grad school. When's she coming back? - Hey, are we gonna shoot this thing or what? If I knew my motivation, maybe I could play the scene better. What's my motivation? You're dead! Dead people have no motivation! They don't do anything! The horror, the horror! I wish there was something I could do to help out, maybe, maybe I could fix up the story. - Listen, fixing this script would be like polishing a turd. Why did you ever wanna write this thing anyway? A long time ago, I went to this high school. Writing this was like coming home again. Could be any of 'em. Even me. Would you be serious? - Look, a good detective doesn't rule out anybody when he's building a case. You see, the note you throw out may kill you. It's so awful. Come here. What? _ (jmere! What? So, uh, you like my uniform, huh? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. J1 Late at night in my apartment J1 I hear the sound of love coming through the wall J1 I long for him deep inside me J1 But here I am, all alone, after all J1 I'm gonna get into the situation J1 I called it love, he said infatuation J1 I've been with boys but he's the one who satisfies J1 He's the only man for me J1 Oh, I need him desperately 41 Man for me, man for me J1 The end of him, that's what he told me J1 He looked at me so warm in light, so goldly J1 I was naive, he was convincing J1 My knees were weak when he said J1 Baby hold me J1 He asked if I need love and some stability J1 He said he must protect his masculinity J1 How can I change his mind, J1 Make him realize J1 He's the only man for me J1 Oh, I need him desperately 41 Man for me - Callie, they're onto us, we know too much! What? Christ, my gun's missing! Blake, what's that noise? For God's sake, lock the door! Look, stop, stop! Honey, they can't hear you, everybody's gone! Where? I don't know, get a grip on yourself! Blake, I think he's gone. Someone must have stolen my gun. Blake! Oh God, Blake! Blake, get up, get up! Oh my God! Get up! And, cut! Yes, great, Callie, that was perfect! - Go again, OK, let's come around on camera, OK. No, Amos, stop! Callie! You OK? We were dead. Come on, just let it go, it's all right. I can't. All right, we'll take a walk. You all right? I guess. Just take some deep breaths, OK? Blake! What? Get over here. That's blood, isn't it? - Looks like someone was dragging a body. A body? I'll check it out. You're not leaving me alone. on, God! What happened here? My guess is they dragged the body. Hacked it up, flushed it. What's that? It was Freddie's. That's Freddie, the first A.D., first assistant director. Not much left. That's all you could find of him? - Um, well, uh, we found the intestines, sir, but, uh, we left them. I mean, well, uh, he just must've eaten, sir, because, uh, well, you know. Yeah, I can imagine. The area sealed off? No one in or out. Good. Then whoever did all this could still be in there. I want a room by room search. I wouldn't do that. " Why not? - We tried that and that's when things got really tough. Whoever or whatever it was, it just made them mad. We have to check every room. Maybe we should get some of the others. Who will we trust? You're right. OK, let's go. Jeez! Robbie! Turn on some lights. OK, boss. God! This can't be happening! Pull yourself together! They were my friends! Look, there's nothing, there's nothing we can do for them now, OK? We, we gotta call the police. No, if we take the time to get help, then the son of a bitch could get away! What does that mean? - It means that he's still here, somewhere. Look, you see this? This blood hasn't had time to dry. Blake? Take a look at this. It just stops. Oh, shit! Wait a minute, maybe we just can't see where it went. Looks like a tunnel. Where? Down! Blake, Blake! Are you OK? Yeah. You ripped it. What are you doing? Going down there. - Without a flashlight, what are you crazy? Why does everybody always wanna go down into a dark basement without a flashlight? - Well, grab one, let's get going! It was a spider. Uh-huh, yeah, it's dead now. Are you OK? No! - Oh, Christ, I can't find the gun. Why not? - Because I don't have a flashlight. Oh. What is this place? I don't know. - This room has to lead someplace! Well, let's hope so. Shh, shh, shh! It's OK, we must be close. To what? How did you know that? Training. Jesus! What the hell is this? I don't know. Hey! Callie! Don't touch 'em! What? I- I-I just comes to warn ya. What are you saying? Look at their faces. Every one of 'em, Cathy Kastleman. The principal's daughter? They all wanted to touch her so, kkeek! So Kastleman made you kill them. - No, no, I've been watchin' him for years. I just found this place, I, I thought you was him coming back. There's one chair left, huh? It's for you. Blake! Kastleman, you honky! There never was an Amos! "Ooh! Ooh, that was fun, I enjoyed that, didn't you enjoy that? Didn't you enjoy that, Steven? Back, get back! Didn't you enjoy it, I did. You did, too, didn't you, didn't you? Yeah. You see now, what you've done, Steven? You have been very destructive to my classroom. You take your seat! Take your seat! You've been very disruptive. You're gonna have to stay after school. Come on, let the girl go! Let the girl go! No, this one is for me. This is one is mine, Steven. Put your hands up, sweetie, and keep 'em up. You stay back, get your hands in there. Get 'em in there, ah! Ooh, not so tight, is it? Is it? This one's mine, Steven. You know why? It's an even trade. You know why? Because you, you killed my daughter. I loved your daughter! Yes, yes, yes, you did! So much so that she got pregnant J1 And she had to give herself an abortion Go 'head, go 'head! Go ahead, you want some of this? Do you want it in the ear'? Y- y-you said Cathy went away, to school! Yes, that's right! She did go away to school. She's in, she's in class everyday. She's a very good student, she's not naughty like you-00 are! Would you like to see her? Hmm? Would you both like to see my sweet Cathy? Oh, mmm, oh! Oh, ah, 0h! There she is! " Cathy! Ah, now, we're going to have a little wedding ceremony! Flowers, garter, she always wanted little purple flowers! She always wanted a full ceremony, she said, "Daddy, can I have a garter belt?" Mwah, and you, you my dear, you, my sweet, mwah, you're going. Not too tight, is it, is it? You are going to be the maid of honor. And you, you, Steven, are going to marry Cathy. I'm not taking this shit anymore. Where, where are you going? Home. What? It's, uh, Monday Night Football. You can't, you can't do that. What are you gonna do about it? L- I'll kill her! Go ahead, she hates football. Blake? - I'm sorry, the Steelers are playin' the Raiders. You shit! Are you crazy? You are crazy. Class dismissed. All right, let's get out of here. - I thought that you were really gonna leave me here. Nah, I hate football. They never got out! Everything happened too fast after that. No one else got out, it was awful! It was awful. Pull yourself together, Mr. Lyman. Now, listen up. I want you to show me the basement, where that classroom is. We're gonna launch a frontal assault! All right, Tyler, wrap it up. Listen up, you 9W3- You ready, check your weapons! We don't know what's in there. Down there. Stand back. It's in our hands now. All clear. - All right, let's move, we're outta here in 30 seconds. Everybody grab your parts! Yo, Robbie! Robbie, you're a genius! Best body shop in town! Boy, you guys really know how to party! Yeah! - Blake, they're gonna find Kastleman's body! I think that's what Harry wants. Some stupid 989! Hey, come on, chill out, man! Harry paid us to go along with it anyway, right? Yeah, just like Oliver and Jimmy. Hey, Robbie, ya had my neck in that noose, man. The fan was buzzing, I thought I was never gonna get outta there alive. What a trip! Terrific, Robbie. Oh, thank you. Give me my arm back later. Yes, sir. Squad car keys? Uh, they're in the dumpster. - Hey, Robbie, save my head for me, will ya? Hold it, hold it! Thanks. Wear it in good health. You know, Harry, I-l can't believe you had this planned from the beginning. I didn't know it was gonna work until Callie and Blake discovered that Kastleman was the real killer! Do you know how much publicity this is gonna generate? They all died but the film survived! It's gonna bank a mint! - Consider some serious therapy, Harry. I'll work on it. Next time, for real. - Check all those bodies, behind those bars there. Jesus, what a mess! ' Ha! Chief? - Check that boiler room out! - This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen, this is the work of a real sicko. ' Cathy? Good, clean hit! Self-defense. I want pictures of all this mess, and get forensic on it right away. The hell happened? They were all dead! Mutilated, we saw them! We did see them! Some sicko must've carted them away. You mean, someone is still out there? Well, that's the way we gotta play it. Wh, h-how do we fill out the reports? We've got no forms to cover this! Shouldataken that NYPD offer. New York can't be as bad as all this. Well, Dad, they're gone. They didn't want the truth, but they'll be back. They always do sequels. And I'll be waiting! No rewrites next time. Dad!
