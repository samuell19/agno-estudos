You think they'd laminate it. Yeah, surely, the money we paid. I'm yet to pay. That's why you're fleeing the country, so you don't have to pay back your student debts. Yeah, suck a fat one, Mr. Prime Minister. Yeah, I hear the underground costs a fuckload over there Lou. Yeah, good luck. One liver in payment for a pint of milk. You'll have to sell your organs. I'll go vegan. And it rains. All the time. Immigration is gonna kick you out anyway. There's too many Australians over there as it is. - And in every pub. - In every school. - In every home. - Jesus Christ, it sounds like propaganda community. Well, you're always welcome back here. - To work in a pub. - Uh, get fucked. I'm actually gonna use my degree. You mean you didn't just do it for the outfit? - Or the juicy dish? - Shut up. You'll be running News Corp in no time. I'll call you Mrs. Murdoch. No, thank you, Nina. - He's rich. - And evil. My kind of man. You look like an idiot. At least I can take this off. - How does it feel? - What? To graduate, idiot. Is there any of that chicken left? I already ate it. You suck. - You think that they would... - Laminate it. I know, right? Mm. I don't think I'll ever go to uni. Shut up, you're in your 11th, Phoebs, what do you know? Well, I'm not in any kind of rush. What can you do with a communications degree anyway? Communicate, idiot. What are you doing? Ravi, you need to get the shit under control. What, the weeds? Yeah, the weeds. It's like a jungle out here. I didn't really notice. Are you done? Sit up. Look into my eyes. Alice. Hmm? - Are you trying to hypnotize me? - No. - This promotes connection. - Oh. Why are we doing this? I think if everyone started their day like this, people would be a lot more kind. Less selfish. You are you and I am me. Look, you're not wrong. My friend's going away. Louise, right? Yeah. Where is she going? London. I had a cousin hooked into the whole living abroad thing. - In a pub? - Yeah. My friend's getting a real job. Excuse me, snob. What? It's true. Did she like it? Yeah. Well, she never came back. - Did she die? - No. She got married. - Idiot. - Same thing. When are you gonna go somewhere, hmm? - Now why would I do that? - Ow! Fuck. You know, escape. See the world. All that shit. Hmm? Can't go anywhere my parents haven't already been. So? Cheers for the drugs. Is that all I'm to you? Where did these come from? You caught me there, Al. Louise. - Louise. - Yeah. What do you want for dinner? Don't know, unh... a curry. Well, I don't know if you'll like Indian. I'll order some Thai. Why did you ask me then? Still at it then? Maybe I'll keep going later. Yeah, maybe. It's turning into a long-term project. Did, find a school in L.A. yet? Yeah, as hoped. When my visa comes in, I'll probably just head over and scout a couple of them out. Did you know that all this used to be pineapple farms? You've been here longer than me, mate. Do you remember moving here? - I was a baby. - Hmm. I was about four. Remember poor old mom spent days lugging boxes up and down. Where was dad? At work moving his women's business. What was that old place like? I don't remember much. It was... it was bigger. I don't know, I remember this woman came once, she was so beautiful. She's very tall and she had this long hair and I begged mom to tell me who she was. - Who was she? - A real estate agent. And I cried so much when they said we were leaving that place. Whatever. Ow! Get in the car. Hey, Phoebe. How long until you go? Ah, few more days. Shit. Don't forget to say goodbye. Bye. When did your sister get cooler than us? People will make fun of your accent, like, all the time. That's okay, it's endearing. It's so cold, the weather is awful. It's gonna take a lot more than bad weather to make me want to come back. What's so bad about coming back? What's up? It's the posse. I was standing there. I was crying. What's the point, it's like this old fucking thing it's over, there's nothing. - Hi. - Hi. You're up? Bottoms up. This stuff seems expensive. Courtesy of mom, passed secret supply. It's very expensive. Hmm. All right. Pass it in. You okay? I don't know. Hey, Alice, can I borrow some of your clothes? Oh, my God. Please. No way. But I was like, anyway. - I don't care about you. - You tend to lose. You know, I can stage. What is it? It's meant to be a bird. - Looks like a taco. - Taco. Well, it fucking hurt. proper ink and stuff like that. - Do you draw? - Yeah. Well, tattoo artists make heaps of money like going around the world and drawing pictures on people. And when I get to LA, I can actually like go to a proper school and study and... because it's actually a fine art. You don't look like you have many. I'm a blank canvas. Good luck with that. See you, Kane. See you. You gonna text me when you get home? Alright, Dad. Sorry. I don't... I don't usually wear this stuff. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm okay. No, keep... keep going. Keep going. Whoa, what the fuck? Yeah, of course. I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna go home. - I think I'm gonna go home now. - Oh yeah? Where do you live? No. No, I'm gonna go home. What? Hey, come on. See you. - Whatever, bitch. - See ya. Wake up sleepyheads, it's lunchtime. Oh, mom, you shouldn't have. Oh, Lou! When did you have time to do all this? You guys have been sleeping all day. Pancakes take like ten seconds. Mm. Hm. Lou, this is like so beautiful, but I think I'm gonna throw up. Just go slow then. You have one new voice message. Hi, darling, congratulations! I hope you had a great graduation yesterday. Sorry I couldn't be there, but I've seen so many of these before. I can imagine what it was like. Anyway, keep everything safe at home for us. You've got the credit card for emergencies. Okay, darling, I have to go. Love you. To callback pre... Fuck. Phone's dead. There you go. What are we gonna do without you, mum? You know I never really liked you guys calling your mum. It's a term of endearment. I can't always be there to check that you've gone to the toilet before you get in the car. Whoa, someone shit in the pancakes? It's nothing. I'll see you guys later. Oh, shit! Louise, can I get a lift in with you? Sure. Hope you don't need a piss. Can you drive me into town? I've got a lot of shit to do today. Please, you don't have to drive me back. - Fine. Alice, are you coming? - No, thanks. I didn't realize you hated being called mom so much. It's just exhausting looking after everyone all the time. That's fine. I like it. Then why'd you get so angry? You know, we only have you for a few more days, Lou. So what? Now that I'm leaving, I'm not allowed to get angry. Well, if that's how you want us to remember you, sure. Oh, I'm sorry Nina. I didn't realize that our friendship was so tenuous. Guess I shouldn't have put in so much effort all these years. - Lou, I... - No, you know I've got a lot of shit to do today, so I can't just be driving you around all fucking day. Fine, I'll walk. Great. I hope you can remember how. Ravi. Oi, you're bleeding. It's fucking gross, dude. Do you want your ball back? Fuck. What? I'm gonna fail and gonna be kicked out of school and take up meth. Jesus. What are you having trouble with? Earth geometry and time zones, latitude, longitude. Well, good luck. Fucking useless. I try. Doing anything tonight? Another party. Cool. What are you wearing? Can I borrow something? - I should be borrowing your clothes. - You can if you want to. You dress like a dweeb skater boy, but you don't skate. And? Fine, I'll see what I can do. So, what do you want me to do? I wanna look like one of those fucked up American beauty queens. Like one of Donald Trump's illegitimate children. - Like a drag queen? - Yeah. Big hair, blue eyeshadow, put it everywhere. - Is this a dress-up party? - No. You're a freak. Perfect. - Fuck, is she? - I don't know. Holy shit, is that Nina? Jesus Christ! You look like Dame Edna. Hello, possums! Nina, you look insane. See you later. What? Hey, how long... how long till this starts working? Sit. I don't know, like a few minutes, maybe ten. Ooh, I feel like it's happening already. My heart is racing. It's gonna be good. I promise. It's really fun. Oh my... I just feel like I'm just gonna be that girl that takes a bad pill and ends up like all over the news, it's just like everywhere, you know. I just really don't wanna die tonight, Alice. Like, do you... do you think maybe I could just throw it up, like... Calm the fuck down, Louise. Fuck. Sorry. I'm off. What? Where are you going? Oh, fuck. - Alice, I do not wanna die. - You're not gonna die, mom. Hey, Alice. Hey. Am I gonna die? Uh, you look fine to me. - She just took her first pill. - Oh, shit. You'll be fine. Just as long as you didn't buy them off some dodgy dude. Dodgy... a dodgy dude. Fuck. - It's Louise, right? - Yeah. How did you know that? I must have seen you out. He was a nice man. Oh, ow! Oi, hey. Oi, dude. Are you a friend of mine? Do you know me? Hey, we are friends, aren't we? You know me, don't you? There it is. I love that smile on you. What did you say? You got a nice smile on you. - You like that? - Yeah. Oh, fuck! What the fuck? - What did you fucking do? - I'm sorry, you didn't like that. Would it be better if I smile? What did it taste like? You were quite something last night. A goddess? Maybe you need to take a... a break. Break from what, Lou? All I'm doing is taking a break. Is that why you're so together then? Can't you tell? Fine. Maybe, a change of scenery. I'm scared of the beach. Why? I've seen what's in there. I don't like it. The bush then. I did enough camping in school. Fine. Cabins? Looks like you're taking the whole house. Well, mom and dad are off to be grey nomads. Turns out they were counting down the seconds until I graduated. Do you ever think about the people that make those boxes? Almost constantly. Where were you last night? I just went for a swim. You didn't miss much. I was gonna do a bunch up with a guy. I bit him. What, was he hitting on you? No. I don't know. He just really got under my skin. So like what's the deal now that you're a shining new graduate? Aren't you meant to have employers falling all over you? What's that supposed to mean? Everyone goes to uni. I didn't. Yeah, but you have L.A., right? When did you find out? Do I need to be worried? Fucking stupid. You look like a million dollars. Nah, I feel like a dollar fifty. Well, we're all going on a little trip. Why? - I just booked it. - What? When did you have time to do that? When you were passed out in the bathroom. - Oh. - Sweet. How'd you pay? From my London savings. Don't worry, won't be missed. You're welcome. Guys, we can do this now. This is being an adult. I thought being an adult was meant to be all the boring stuff. We are being kids. Yeah, kids with a driver's license and a house in the country. Whatever. - Yeah. - I didn't know they still made these. We were never allowed these as kids. Why not? Phoebe had one in the car once, she stuck the gum under the seat, and it is still bloody there. Fucking Phoebe. Mm. So how does it taste after all these years? Great shit, to be honest. Fuck. My phone's dead. - Mine, too. - Same. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ! Sorry, Lou, we didn't know we were coming. I've just canceled my plan, so there's not much credit left. Only use it if we're desperate. Looks like we're doing it the old-fashioned way. Do you even know where you are going? - Roughly. - Oh, great. You know this thing's from 2004. Look, it can't have changed that much. Look, the guy at the server said that we should go left. It's gonna take like an hour off our trip. This is right. Left will take us literally directly away from where we want to go. Yeah, but it's not like that dude would lie. Unless he wants to send us somewhere secluded and slaughter us all, pull an Ivan Milat. Okay, not so funny. You know I'd be the first one to die. - I think we should go left. - Fine. We'll go left then. Real adults. I don't know where the fuck we are. - How much further? - My bum's going dead. Fine, you drive. I think we are close. - Hi. - Hello. Do you know the way to Beacon Street? We're a bit lost. Yes, of course. So you're almost there. You just go straight down the road and take the right at the next lane. - Oh, great, thank you. - You're welcome. Anything else I can help you with? Yeah, how many nuggets can I get for ten dollars? How many could I get for twenty dollars? - Anything else I can get you? - No, thank you. - This isn't too bad. - This is great. Thanks, mum. - The country is terrifying. - I think it's calming. - Something out there? - Yeah, but you can't see. Shit. What's up? I'm gonna go for a walk. I think it's bullshit that people don't believe in aliens. You have to be mad to think we're the only ones. Do you think they can see us? I think they probably got better things to do. - Well, do you want them to? - No. No, I don't. Where is Lou? Inside. Sleeping. Um, it must feel good. Why? Just being so close. To leaving? To starting... something. You'd know though, right? Still sore? Yeah. Maybe wash the needle a bit more next time. Yeah. This would all float away if we were up there. So would we. - Oh, beat us to it. - Down for a swim? Yeah. - Just like... - Yes. Like, you know, and everyone laughs. There... there was shrimp. There was a lot more. I've never worn a bikini before, ever. - That's strange. - Super strange. Not at all. You're a good Catholic girl. None of that sinful flesh piece... Oh, my God! Put it away. - What if you do that? - I can't. No. Get on my shoulder. Hey, Lou. Are you always in clothes in a bath too? Or in a shower? Get fucked, you know what I mean. Does anyone have sunscreen? Lou, do you have sunscreen? For fuck's sake. What do you guys feel like eating? Anybody? - What about pasta? - Or a nice salad? Hmm. Make some decisions. I'm not the parent here. What about pasta and a salad? - Or a pasta salad. - Yeah. Well, you guys are idiots. - Where's Nina? - She's in the car. Nice jacket. Thanks. Do you wanna go for a walk? Yeah. - Is this yours? - Yeah. So sweaty. It's fine. It's hot. - I am too. - Hmm. - How do you feel? - Good. - Okay. - No, good, good. I feel good. My body feels good. What are you in town for? Oh, um, my friend's going away for a really long time, so we're here as a kind of her treat thing. Where is she going? To work for NASA. She's becoming an astronaut, so. Cool. I mean, I wanted to go too. I mean, I'm qualified but there is only space in the program, so I gave it up for her. - Noble of you. - Yeah. Is that the girl you were with the... the bag of pies? Yeah, that's Louise. Yeah. She's pretty. Uh, that was my first time. Ah. Um. Thank you. No, I... I'm on it, honestly. I... I've done it with boys before like loads. Sure. Have you ever had proper sex before? Proper sex? Um... Um... I guess not. I should go. Yeah, that's cool. I actually have to go to work anyway. You're not gonna shower first? We should go and look for her. She'll come back. - She might be hurt. - She'll come back. She doesn't know where we are. She doesn't even have the address. Are you gonna get in trouble with work? Maybe, I don't know. They knew I was gonna be leaving anyway. You've been working there forever. Yeah, since I was 14. That's a very long time. How much do you have saved up? About forty grand. Whoa, what the fuck! Oh, yeah. What do you think I did with all my money? I don't know, just... That's so much money. Yeah. You can still go to L.A., you know, just marry an old desperate lady and you can get a Green Card that way. Yeah. I don't know if I'm gonna go anywhere anymore. Oh. Why? I don't know. I think I'm just... waiting for something. Waiting for what? To know what to do. You're gonna be waiting a very long time for that. She better not be dead. Nina. Nina. Nina. Nina. You asked me the other day what will be so bad about coming back. I don't know. I can't not go, you know. And Tess said that I had to do it. You won't remember this, but there was this geography assignment and you counted all the countries in the world and then divided that by the average lifespan just so you could figure out how many days you could live in each. Yeah. What a little nerd. You were never gonna stay here, were you? What? Don't worry, I'm not moving in. I just got back, actually. Where did you go? Just away for a little while. It's really insane actually. So, you're stopping by at eight in the morning, actually? Yeah, I guess. I just came to apologize, uh... All that bunch of weeds I left on your doorstep the other day. Yeah, that was pretty lame. Do you want to come in? - Can I use your bathroom? - Oh, my God. - I'm busting... - Go on now, get in. How was it, hmm? - It was good? - It was good.
