GOOD MORNING, PAPA! BUON-GIORNO! TERRY! ENOUGH STUDYING. TAKE A BREAK AND GO TO SCHOOL. ( sighs ) WHAT A KID. SHE LOVES THOSE BOOKS. SO, PAPA... YOU BIG CUTIE. WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR BREAKFAST? BREAKFAST, LET’S SEE. I’M GOING TO HAVE SOME PEPPERS AND EGGS AND A LITTLE ZASEECH ON THE SIDE. YOU ARE, HUH? SURE. HEY, YOU READ THIS? THEY CAUGHT THREE KIDS DOING GRAFFITI ALL OVER CITY HALL. OH, NO. WHAT GETS ME IS, WHY WOULD KIDS WHO CAN’T SPELL PAINT WORDS ALL OVER IN PUBLIC? ( laughs ) KIDS ARE DIFFERENT TODAY, POP. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. KIDS ARE STILL KIDS. WHAT’S DIFFERENT IS PARENTS. PARENTS ARE NOT PARENTS ANYMORE. THAT’S THE DIFFERENCE. WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US A BREAK? I DON’T KNOW HOW I DO IT. I KNOW WITH PHIL GONE, RUNNING THIS DELI AND ALL. HEY, YOU KNOW WHY YOU DO IT? BECAUSE I BROUGHT YOU UP RIGHT. YOU WORK HARD, GRACE. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD, I WAS PLAYING SECOND TENOR WITH CHARLIE BARNET. Both: SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK ON THE ROAD. HEY. ( chuckles ) HEY, WHAT’S THIS? I ORDERED PEPPERS AND EGGS AND A LITTLE ZASEECH, COME ON. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, AND DR. COLBERT ORDERED DRY TOAST AND EGG WHITES. WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

HEY, MA, YOU GOT ANY STEAK? NO, BUT WE GOT SAUSAGE. TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? CLOTHES. I NEED STEAK, MA. VENUS FLYTRAPS ONLY EAT PURE PROTEIN. PROCESSED FOODS WOULD KILL THEM. YOU KNOW, THOSE PLANTS EAT BETTER THAN ME. EVERYBODY EATS BETTER THAN ME. I GOTTA GIVE THEM STEAK BECAUSE IF I WIN THAT SCIENCE AWARD, I GET $500. $500 CASH? YEAH. WHY DON’T YOU USE ME AS YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT? WE’LL SPLIT THE DOUGH. I CAN’T BECAUSE I HAVE TO BUY A COMPUTER. I ALREADY HAVE $263 IN THE BANK. 300 MORE AND I’M ONLINE CRUISING THE INTERNET AT 33 MEGAHERTZ PER SECOND. MMM, THAT SMELLS GOOD. WHAT’S A MEGAHERTZ? YOU’RE ASKING ME? HI, GEORGE. GOT MY FLOWERS? UH-HUH. THANKS, GEORGE. I CAN’T SHOW THE SMITH HOUSE. I’VE GOT THE HENSONS' CONDO. WELL, YOU’RE RIGHT. RESCHEDULE THE CONDO. THE HOUSE IS A MUCH BIGGER COMMISSION. STAVROS, MAYBE THAT ONE. OH, I CAN’T. I’VE GOT THE LARCHMONT LADIES LEAGUE AT 4:00. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE SHOE SALE TODAY. I CAN’T TODAY, KAREN, HONEY. TOMORROW. BUT THE PUMPS I WANT FOR THE PROM WILL BE GONE. MORNING. DAVID CAN TAKE YOU RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL. NO, I CAN’T, MOM. I HAVE BASKETBALL. THANKS A LOT. YOU KNOW, I’M JUST GRADUATING NINTH GRADE, A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME THING. MAYBE NOT. WITH YOUR GRADES, THEY’LL PROBABLY LET YOU TRY IT A FEW TIMES. DOUG, THIS BABY DOES 180 ON THE AUTOBAHN. SURE, YOU CAN TEST-DRIVE IT THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU WANT, NO PROBLEM, JUST CALL ONE OF MY SALESMEN. MORNING, KIDS. HI, DADDY. INSTANT SCIENCE PROJECT? JUST ADD WATER. KNOCK, KNOCK! Both: WHO’S THERE?

CARL, I’LL HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK. KAREN! MY MOM SAYS THE LARCHMONT’S LADIES LEAGUE IS DONATING FOOD FOR THE PROM... FROM MAMA LUNA’S. DELI GIRL’S STORE? WELL, I GUESS IF TERRY CAN’T GO TO THE PROM, HER MOM’S SALAMI CAN. ( laughs ) YOU ARE SO BAD. THAT’S NOT YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT, IS IT? YEAH. FLOWERS FROM THE BACKYARD? I’LL SAY I FED THEM ON PEANUT BUTTER OR SOMETHING. GOOD LUCK. HEY, CHECK OUT DELI GIRL. WHAT DID SHE DO? BUILD A SPACE STATION? ( both laugh ) ( bus door closes ) WHAT IT IS, IT’S A HELMET THAT GOES OFF YOUR INNER THOUGHTS WITH SUCH-- ( children laughing ) YOU OKAY, LOUIS? I’M OKAY. HE’S DEAD. TERRY, WHAT KIND OF PLANTS ARE THOSE? DIONAEA MUSCIPULA. THAT’S VENUS FLYTRAPS. THEY’RE CUTE. THEY’RE CARNIVOROUS. THAT’S A MEAT-EATER. I KNOW THAT. LISTEN, TERRY, I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD PARTNER UP ON OUR PROJECTS. YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. COME ON, TERRY. YOUR PLANTS HAVE BABIES. YOU CAN SPARE ONE AT LEAST. FORGET IT. ARE YOU GOING TO THE PROM? WHAT DOES PROM HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? WELL, MAYBE CHAD COULD SET YOU UP WITH A GUY ON THE TRACK TEAM. A JOCK? I DON’T THINK TERRY'S THAT DESPERATE. I DON’T BELIEVE IN PROMS. WELL, THAT’S BECAUSE YOU CAN’T GET A DATE. JUST HELP ME OUT, TERRY. WHY SHOULD I? IT’S NOT MY FAULT YOU'RE FLUNKING SCIENCE. YOU DON’T EVEN PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS. ( scoffs ) NICE PROJECT. TERRY’S GONNA WIN THE SCIENCE AWARD AND THEN BUY A COMPUTER. WE’LL SEE ABOUT THAT. HELP HER WITH HER SCIENCE PROJECT. THAT KAREN RIDGEWAY HAS BEEN TRYING TO WEASEL HOMEWORK OUT OF ME EVER SINCE THE FOURTH GRADE. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? SHE’S A CHEERLEADER. YEAH, NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I GUESS ALL THAT JUMPING IN PUBLIC RATTLES THE BRAIN. I AM SO SICK OF THAT LOSER TERRY VENESSI. I KNOW. WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS, ANYWAY, ALBERT EISENSTEIN? REALLY. BLAIR? CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU A MOMENT? GREAT. HI, GANG. HI, CHAD. HOLD THIS, WILL YOU? SO, LIKE THE NEW CHEERLEADING UNIFORMS? THEY’RE CUTE. HI, CHAD. HI, NICOLE. I JUST PLANTED THE INFANT FLYTRAPS, BUT FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, I’VE BEEN FEEDING THE ADULT FLYTRAPS RAW MEAT. YOU KNOW, INSECTS, STEAK, NOTHING ARTIFICIAL. I EXPOSE THEM TO ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF SUNLIGHT A DAY, AND THE SPRAY’S ON A TIMER USING ONLY PURIFIED WATER. ( water burbling ) INGENIOUS, TERRY. REALLY. TAKE A GOOD LOOK, CLASS. THIS IS HOW IT’S DONE. ( school bell rings ) ALL RIGHT, WE’LL DISCUSS THE OTHER PROJECTS TOMORROW. REALLY NICE WORK, TERRY. THANKS. ( indistinct conversations ) WELL, YOU’VE GOT TO ADMIT. IT’S A PRETTY GOOD PROJECT. RIGHT NOW IT IS. KAREN, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? NOTHING. IT’S JUST THAT TERRY'S GROWN-UP PLANTS LOOK SO HUNGRY. MAYBE THEY WANT SOME POTATO CHIPS. BUT TERRY SAID THEY ONLY EAT MEAT. DID SHE? ( all chuckles ) I DON’T UNDERSTAND, MR. BALFOUR. THEY SEEMED PERFECTLY FINE YESTERDAY. I’M SORRY, TERRY. BUT THESE THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES. BUT EVEN IF THE EXPERIMENT FAILS, THERE ARE CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN. YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY? YES, MR. BALFOUR. AND HOW’S YOUR PROJECT, KAREN? PERFECT. YOU SEE, MY EXPERIMENT IS ALL ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CARNIVOROUS PLANTS AND, UM, REGULAR PLANTS. ONE HALF IS LILIES, AND ON THE OTHER HALF, I HAVE A LITTLE BABY VENUS FLYTRAP. ISN’T IT CUTE? REAL CUTE. AND, LOUIS, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? WELL, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT SHORT, LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRIC SHOCKS MAY TRIGGER CERTAIN PLEASANT MEMORIES. FOR INSTANCE. SEE WHAT I MEAN? ( students chuckle ) YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, I WANT TO RE-CHOREOGRAPH THAT TIGERS’ ROUTINE. WELL, LIKE HOW? WELL, LET’S RUN IT. OKAY. Both: BLACK! BLACK! TIGER FANS, YELL FIGHT. FIGHT! F-I-G-H-T. TIGER FANS, YELL FIGHT. FIGHT! SHE COMPLETELY SABOTAGED MY PROJECT, AND YOU KNOW SHE DUG UP MY BABY FLYTRAP. YOU ARE SCARY WHEN YOU’RE LIKE THIS. I’M GOING TO GET HER WHERE SHE LIVES. THE MALL? I’M GOING TO NEED SOME SARDINES, SOME GARLIC, SOME SOUR MILK, MOLDY CHEESE AND BAKING POWDER. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE? I’M GOING TO MAKE HER LITTLE CHEERLEADING OUTFIT REEK FOREVER. LIKE WE DID TO NICOLE LAST HALLOWEEN? YEAH, EXACTLY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET INTO HER LOCKER? WE’LL FIGURE IT OUT. JUST GET ME THAT GUNK FROM THE LAB AND MEET ME BACK HERE IN HALF AN HOUR. OKAY. UGH, SMELL THAT. OVERKILL? NO SUCH THING. OKAY, GIVE ME THE STUFF. ALL RIGHT. GO STAND GUARD. OH, YEAH. HOW MUCH SHOULD I USE? SIX DROPS. OKAY. OR SIX MILLILITERS. WHICH ONE IS IT? UH-OH. OH, PLEASE TELL ME "UH-OH" DOESN’T MEAN YOU FORGOT. I FORGOT. LOUIS! HARLOW! HARLOW? HURRY! QUICK, HOW MUCH SHOULD I USE? LOUIS! LOUIS! HERE HE COMES! TERRY? TERRY? TERRY VENESSI? TERRY! ( students murmuring ) I GUESS IT WAS SIX DROPS. I’M SORRY WE'VE HAD TO DELAY THIS MEETING, BUT MAYBE YOUR NOSES CAN STILL TELL YOU THAT THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS. I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR FAMILIES WITH YOU, THOUGH. TERRY’S A CONSCIENTIOUS STUDENT, MR. HARLOW. SHE WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS INTENTIONALLY. WELL, THANK YOU, MR. BALFOUR. WELL, KAREN DIDN’T DO ANYTHING. IN FACT, I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHY WE SHOULD BE HERE. BECAUSE SHE RUINED TERRY’S SCIENCE PROJECT. HARDLY THE SAME AS VANDALIZING SCHOOL PROPERTY. IT’S WORSE. OH, REALLY? WHAT ABOUT THE-- NOW, LADIES, PLEASE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME-- THIS IS NOT THE FIFTH TIME THAT WE’VE ALL BEEN HERE TOGETHER IN THIS OFFICE. I’M SURE WE ALL REMEMBER THE LITTLE INCIDENT WITH THE TEAR-AWAY BASKETBALL JERSEY? I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP HER GET A DATE. THE POINT IS I DON’T THINK THAT I CAN HANDLE THIS FEUD OF YOURS WITH ANOTHER LITTLE MERE SUSPENSION. I’VE TURNED THE MATTER OVER TO A JUVENILE OFFICER. THE POLICE? MR. BALFOUR? THIS IS OFFICER SMITH. I THINK YOU’LL FIND SHE HAS A VERY INTERESTING TAKE ON THIS MATTER. GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE DAMAGE AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIRLS’ ANIMOSITY TO EACH OTHER, I’M GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT THEY BE EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL AND SENT TO THE JUVENILE WORK FARM IN BIXBY FOR 30 DAYS. WHAT? YOU’RE SENDING TERRY TO JAIL? WORK FARM. YOU CAN’T DO THAT. CAN SHE? WHAT ABOUT THE PROM? OH, NOW THAT’S REALLY IMPORTANT. WE’RE BOTH GOING TO HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR MORONIC PROM. AT LEAST I’M GOING. WELL, DON’T WORRY. I’M SURE THE WORK FARM WILL HAVE A SPRING HOEDOWN. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. YOU ALWAYS WALK AROUND LIKE YOU’RE SMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. THAT’S BECAUSE I AM. WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BE SOMETHING IF YOU’RE GOING TO LIVE IN A DELI. KAREN! WELL, IT SURE BEATS THINKING YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE RICH. TERRY, BE QUIET. OFFICER, IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO SEND THE GIRLS TO A WORK FARM? THERE MAY BE AN ALTERNATIVE, A MORE... CREATIVE SENTENCE. I DIDN’T BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT’S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE JUST HOW MUCH OF THEIR INTOLERANCE AND PREJUDICE THE GIRLS LEARN IN THEIR HOME. WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING? SHE IS IMPLYING THAT YOU TAUGHT KAREN EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT BEING A SNOB. WELL, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. JUST BECAUSE YOU COULDN’T-- MILLIE. MILLIE. OFFICER, YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE? CREATIVE SENTENCING? YES, MR. RIDGEWAY. INSTEAD OF EXPULSION AND A MONTH AT BIXBY, I SUGGEST THE GIRLS DO 50 HOURS OF GARBAGE DETAIL FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. GROSS. SHUT UP. YOU SHUT UP. AND... THAT THEY SWITCH FAMILIES FOR A MONTH TO SEE HOW THE OTHER GIRL LIVES. YOU CAN’T MAKE ME LIVE IN A DELI. JACK, SAY SOMETHING. I THINK IT’S AN INSPIRED IDEA. ( chuckles ) THANK YOU, MR. RIDGEWAY. OF COURSE, I CAN’T FORCE YOU INTO ANYTHING. IT’S YOUR CHOICE. OUR CHOICE? SOME CHOICE, LIVING WITH THEM? MA, YOU WANT TO SPEAK UP HERE? TERRY CAN STAY IN SCHOOL? DEFINITELY. WE’LL DO IT. THERE MUST BE SOME ALTERNATIVE-- COUNT US IN, TOO, OFFICER. GOOD. NOW, GIRLS, THIS IS FOR REAL. WHEN YOU SWITCH FAMILIES, YOU’VE GOT TO DO EACH OTHER’S CHORES AND OBEY EACH OTHER’S PARENTS. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU’RE IN THIS TOGETHER, AND YOU’RE GOING TO WALK IN EACH OTHER’S SHOES FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS. UNDERSTOOD? CAN I STILL GO TO THE PROM? ( laughs ) WHAT? MAN! TERRY, HURRY UP! I AM. DID YOU PACK YOUR GOOD BLUE SKIRT? UH, YEAH. GREAT, AND HOW ABOUT THAT NICE GRAY CARDIGAN? OH, NO. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT, MA? I DON’T WANT THEM THINKING YOU ARE SOME GAVONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DRESS. WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT THEY THINK? IT MATTERS. THAT MILLIE RIDGEWAY HAS CALLED ALREADY THREE TIMES TODAY. CHE COSA, THOSE QUESTIONS SHE ASKS. SHE MUST THINK YOU WERE RAISED BY WOLVES. OR MUSICIANS. ( laughs ) OKAY, POP, WELL, I WILL BE BACK IN ONE HALFHOUR. OKAY. AND I WILL BE BACK IN A MONTH. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. WHAT DO YOU GOT PLANNED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, POP? WELL, LET’S SEE. MICHELLE PFEIFFER CALLED AND CANCELLED OUR LUNCH, AND SO I FIGURED I’D REARRANGE THE BISCOTTI, YOU KNOW. GOOD. AND HAVE A FEW OLD FRIENDS OVER FOR SOME CHIANTI. HEY, WHO? HEY, WHO. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING, "WHO"? WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT THIS AFTERNOON, 4:00, DR. COLBERT. NOW, I LEFT THE DIRECTIONS AND THE ADDRESS BY THE CASH REGISTER. HEY, HEY, HEY, I’M A BIG BOY NOW, ALL RIGHT? I MEAN, IF I CAN GET TO THE PARAMOUNT THEATER BY MYSELF, I CAN CERTAINLY GET TO THE DOCTOR BY MYSELF. ALL RIGHT, OKAY. GIVE ME THESE. HEY, MA! I GOT ’EM, I GOT 'EM. ( babbles and chuckles ) HEY, WHIZ KID, DON’T I GET A LITTLE SUGAR? YES. MMM! TI VUOLO BENE, BELLISIMA. HEY, WHAT’S THE WORD, MOCKINGBIRD? SWING AND SWEAT AND CHARLIE BARNET. GIVE THIS LADY AN "A." TRY TO HAVE SOME FUN OVER THERE, OKAY? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BYE, PAPA. DAVID, YOU THINK IT’S GOING TO BE WEIRD? I THINK IT BEATS BEING ON TRASH DETAIL. NO, IT DOESN’T. I HAVE TO DO THAT, TOO, IN A TACKY ORANGE JUMPSUIT. WELL, AT LEAST IT’LL MATCH YOUR HAIR. OH, THAT’S NICE. THIS IS SO UNFAIR. SHE GETS TO LIVE IN LUXURY AND I HAVE TO LIVE HERE, IN A DELI. AT LEAST YOU’LL EAT WELL. BESIDES, HOW WEIRD CAN IT REALLY BE? BESIDES, HOW WEIRD CAN IT REALLY BE? AW, KAREN AND HER BOYFRIEND. DIE, DIE! ( chuckles ) ( telephone rings ) HELLO? WE’RE WATCHING YOU, DELI GIRL. ( girls laugh ) WHO IS THIS? ( girls laugh ) WOW... COOL. LOOK THROUGH THIS. LOOK THROUGH THIS. COME ON, LOOK THROUGH THIS. STOP. ( telephone rings ) HELLO? DO YOU DELIVER? ( both laugh ) HA HA HA. WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR? BLACK, WHICH IS THE ABSENCE OF ALL COLORS. DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE SISTER? LUCKILY, NO. WANT TO HEAR SOME "KNOCK-KNOCK" JOKES? KNOCK-KNOCK. KNOCK-KNOCK. YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO SAY "WHO'S THERE?" SHOULDN’T YOU BE IN A PLAY GROUP OR SOMETHING? NO. ( laughs ) BOOBY TRAP! BOOBY TRAP! ( telephone rings ) BOOBY-TRAP! BOOBY-TRAP! BOOBY-TRAP! BOOBY-TRAP! BOOBY-TRAP! BOOBY TRAP! THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM IN THAT CLOSET. DO YOU HAVE ANY WOODEN HANGERS? ALL I FOUND WAS WIRE. NO, THAT’S IT. OH, UH, SOMEBODY NAMED CHAD CALLED. HE CALLED ABOUT FOUR TIMES THIS MORNING. WHY DIDN’T YOU COME AND GET ME? WHAT? WHAT AM I, THE BELLBOY? WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU GOT TO THINK. ( chuckles ) KIDS TODAY. DOES THIS PLACE ALWAYS SMELL LIKE SALAMI? OH, NO, NO. ON WEDNESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, IT SMELLS LIKE BROCCOLI. HI, CHAD. NO, THEY ONLY HAVE ONE LINE. I KNOW, MUY PRIMITIVO. HEY, YOU GOT TWO MINUTES ON THIS LINE. IT’S A BUSINESS PHONE. I GOT TO GO, CHAD. YEAH, I’LL TALK TO YOU LATER. YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY OWN PHONE AT HOME. I COULDN’T LIVE WITHOUT IT. WHAT DOES TERRY DO? HER HOMEWORK. OH, THAT’S RIGHT. BOYS DON’T CALL TERRY. OKAY, CARL, MY PLEASURE. BYE. WELL, DID YOU GET SETTLED, TERRY? OH, YES, BUT SOME STUFF FELL OUT OF THE CLOSET-- OH, DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES? EXCUSE ME? IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN’T EAT, JUST TELL EDNA. UH, LET’S SEE. OH, NOW HERE ARE THE HOUSE RULES. YOU JUST READ THEM THROUGH. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS-- I’LL JUST ASK YOU AT DINNER. OH, WELL, NO, I WON’T BE HOME FOR DINNER. I HAVE TO SHOW A HOUSE AT 6:00 AND THEN LADIES LEAGUE. COME HERE. HERE’S OUR WHOLE NIGHT RIGHT HERE ON THIS CALENDAR. SEE, JACK’S IN BLACK. I’M IN RED, DAVID'S IN GREEN, TIFF’S IN BLUE. DAVID’S AT THE MOVIES, AND JACK HAS SOME CIGAR NIGHT THING WITH HIS SALESMEN. OH, THE MAIN THINGS FOR YOU TO REMEMBER ARE YOU HAVE TWO HOURS A DAY ON YOUR TELEPHONE, NO R-RATED VIDEOS, NO BOYS IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE EVER. EDNA IS NOT A SLAVE. WE RECYCLE. AND ABSOLUTELY NO DIRTY TOWELS ON ANY OF THE BATHROOM FLOORS. OKAY. SOUNDS LIKE FUN. OH, BE CAREFUL. THAT’S FROM GERMANY. THIS IS NOT BOOT CAMP, REALLY. IT’S JUST THAT WE'RE ALL SO BUSY, IT REALLY HELPS IF WE’RE ORGANIZED. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. WELL, GREAT. THEN I’LL SEE YOU LATER. READ YOUR HOUSE RULES. SEE YOU LATER. "HERE AT THE RIDGEWAY HOUSE, WE BELIEVE TEAMWORK IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS"? I’M TOAST. HELLO, MAVIS. MAVIS-- DIETING. SO, NICOLE TELLS ME THE VENESSI GIRL MOVED IN TODAY. 30 DAYS AND COUNTING. DON’T WORRY. EVERYONE KNOWS KAREN WAS JUST REACTING TO THAT HORRIBLE GIRL. SHE’S JUST LIKE HER MOTHER. GRACE VENESSI WAS A TROUBLEMAKER, TOO, REMEMBER? DIDN’T SHE PROTEST AGAINST THE DRESS CODE IN HIGH SCHOOL? SHE SURE DID. AND FROM THE WAY SHE DRESSES NOW, LOOKS LIKE SHE’S STILL PROTESTING. ( both chuckle ) GIGI. MM-HMM. BETWEEN YOU, ME AND THE LAMPPOST, I THINK THIS WHOLE THING COULD PUT YOU RIGHT OVER THE TOP. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LOOK AROUND, MILLIE. Both: FRANCINE. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM FEELS SORRY FOR YOU. YOU’RE BOUND TO BE NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE. YOU THINK? YOU GET ANOTHER VOTE FOR EVERY DAY KAREN’S STUCK IN THAT DELI. BOO. ( chuckles ) WHAT’S THE MATTER? CAN’T SLEEP? THE BED WAS TOO SOFT. AH, FELT THE PEA, HUH? EXCUSE ME? IT’S A FAIRY TALE. ABOUT THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA. IT’S ABOUT THIS HOITY-TOITY PRINCESS WHO COULDN’T SLEEP BECAUSE SHE FELT A LITTLE PEA WHILE SLEEPING ON A STACK OF MATTRESSES. I AM NOT HOITY-TOITY. COULD HAVE FOOLED ME. HOW ABOUT SOME TOMATO AND PROVOLONE, HUH? GROSS. EAT THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED, YOU’LL DREAM IN TECHNICOLOR. WHAT ARE THOSE PILLS FOR? OH, THESE PILLS? THESE ARE BLOOD THINNERS. DOCTOR SAYS I GOT TO HAVE SKINNY BLOOD. MY MOM SAYS CHEESE WILL KILL YOU. WE USE SOY CHEESE. IT’S JUST LIKE REAL CHEESE, ONLY IT’S MADE FROM BEANS. CHEESE FROM BEANS. MMM, THAT MUST TASTE BLECH!

EDNA USUALLY MAKES ME A SOY MILK SMOOTHIE. LET ME GUESS. FROM BEANS, EH? PAPA, GET HER A NICE JELLY DOUGHNUT. GOOD IDEA. YEAH. ( sighs ) KAREN, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER, I WAS ONCE SUSPENDED FROM CHEERLEADING. YOU WERE A CHEERLEADER? YEAH. THEY DUMPED ME FOR PROTESTING THE DRESS CODE. YEAH, THEY WANT THE CHEERLEADERS TO BE PERKY, NOT POLITICAL. DID YOU EVER GET OVER IT? IT RUINED HER LIFE. IT DID NOT. OF COURSE I GOT OVER IT. YOU WILL, TOO. LISTEN, GO ON NOW, YOU’RE GOING TO MISS YOUR BUS, OKAY? YOU ALL RIGHT? I’LL SEE YOU LATER. THIS IS DELICIOUS. IT’S 'CAUSE IT’S NOT MADE FROM BEANS. THAT’S A SIN. POOR GIRL. I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT MILLIE. SHE DIDN’T TELL HER ABOUT THIS. HEY, MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD GET TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, COMPARE NOTES. THAT WOMAN HAS MORE NOTES THAN A PICCOLO. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. WHAT?

WHAT YOU GOT TO DO IS, YOU GOT TO WRAP A TOURNIQUET ABOVE THE FANG PUNCTURE SO THAT THE VENOM DOESN’T TRAVEL UP THE LEG, THEN SOMEONE HAS TO SUCK ALL THE POISON OUT WITH THEIR MOUTH. DO YOU EVER STOP TALKING? NO. BUT YOU SOUND LIKE SUCH A NERD. I AM A NERD. ( laughs ) LOUIS, I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUCH A NERD. I’M REALLY IMPRESSED. SEE YOU LATER, LOUIS. NEW GIRLFRIEND, LOUIS? SHE WAS CRYING, OKAY? WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? SHE WAS CRYING? REALLY? SO HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT IN SALAMI CITY? AND WHY WERE YOU TALKING TO THAT MORON? NICOLE, WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME I GOT SUSPENDED FROM THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD? ME? I THOUGHT BLAIR TOLD YOU. I’M SO SORRY. OH, YOU POOR THING. I’LL MAKE HER APOLOGIZE TO YOU AT LUNCH.

AND A SPARKLING WATER, PLEASE. VERY GOOD. YOU KNOW, GRACE-- I THINK THAT PROBABLY-- ( both chuckle ) YOU GO FIRST. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE TAKEN DIFFERENT ROADS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. THAT’S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. YES. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I DON’T BLAME YOU FOR THE TROUBLE KAREN IS IN. I DON’T BLAME ME EITHER. WELL, NO, WHAT-- WHAT I MEAN IS, THAT OFFICER SEEMED TO FEEL THAT CHILDREN ARE A REFLECTION OF THEIR PARENTS. THAT REMARK ABOUT YOUR HOME, I-- WELL, I DON’T KNOW WHERE KAREN GOT THAT ATTITUDE. I MEAN, JACK AND I HAVE CERTAINLY NEVER ENCOURAGED HER TO BE SO HEARTLESS ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGED. YEAH, WELL... KIDS CAN SURPRISE YOU. I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE, I WAS AN AVERAGE STUDENT, RIGHT, IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND HERE’S TERRY, STRAIGHT As. ALL As, MY TERRY. BUT, OF COURSE, THAT DOESN’T MEAN SHE CAN LORD IT OVER ANYBODY. OF COURSE. JACK SEEMS TO FEEL THAT THIS SWITCH WILL BE GOOD FOR KAREN, GIVE HER SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE REAL WORLD. BUT I’M WORRIED SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE HOW DIFFERENT THINGS ARE. WELL, US FOLKS IN THE REAL WORLD WILL DO OUR VERY BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS GO AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR MISS KAREN DURING HER STAY IN THE SLUMS. THAT’S NOT HOW I MEANT IT AT ALL. HOW’D YOU MEAN IT, MILLIE, HUH? I MEAN, I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU. ONE MINUTE YOU’RE TELLING ME THAT YOU DON’T KNOW WHERE KAREN GETS HER ATTITUDE, AND THE NEXT MINUTE, YOU’RE CALLING ME DISADVANTAGED TO MY FACE. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? WHY ARE YOU BEING SO SENSITIVE ABOUT THIS? I-I’M JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN HOW I FEEL AND CLEAR THE AIR. WELL, CLEAR THIS. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT MY TERRY GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU. IN FACT, I’M WORRIED. I’M AFRAID SHE'S GOING TO COME HOME A SNOTTY, STUCK-UP LITTLE SOCIALITE LIKE KAREN. GET OVER IT, GRACE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE HAD A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER EVER SINCE I WENT AWAY TO COLLEGE AND YOU HAD TO STAY BEHIND. YES, YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE ON WALNUT LANE. WELL, YOU CAN RESENT ME ALL YOU LIKE. YOU LEAVE MY DAUGHTER OUT OF THIS. FINE, FINE. BUT IF YOU DO ANYTHING TO MY DAUGHTER, YOU HURT HER IN ANY WAY, I WILL BE IN YOUR FACE SO FAST YOU’LL THINK I'M THE ALIEN. YOU CAPICHE, MILLIE RIDGEWAY? I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY. IF I’VE TAUGHT KAREN ANYTHING, I’VE TAUGHT HER NEVER TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER SUCCESS. MY DAUGHTER MAY HAVE TO LIVE WITH YOU, GRACE, BUT SHE DOESN’T HAVE TO LOWER HER STANDARDS. NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY APPETITE. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU GOTTA PUT JUST A LITTLE PRESSURE ON IT. JUST A LITTLE PRESSURE. NOT TOO HARD. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW TO CUT MEAT? I’M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO EAT IT. LOOK, PRINCESS, DON’T GET MAD. IT’S DANGEROUS. YOU COULD SLICE YOUR FINGER OFF. ALL RIGHT, NOW LOOK, YOU GOT TO PLAY THE SLICER. YOU KNOW, IT’S LIKE TOMMY DORSEY ON THE TROMBONE. ( humming tune ) SEE, YOU GET A RHYTHM, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SMOOTH. HOW’S THAT? WELL, YOU’RE NO TOMMY DORSEY, BUT IT’S OKAY. HEY, KAREN. CAN I GET BREAD AND MUSTARD FOR THAT, OR DO YOU JUST WANT ME TO EAT OFF YOUR HANDS? HI, CHAD. CHAD? SO YOU’RE THE GUY'S CALLING EVERY FIVE MINUTES, EH? YOU WANT TO BUY A SANDWICH? SURE. WE ALL DO, RIGHT, GUYS? YEAH. I MEAN, AS LONG AS KAREN’S MAKING THEM, YOU KNOW. PAPA TOGNETTI, NICE TO MEET YOU. HEY, YOU BREAK THAT, YOU BUY IT. OKAY. HE’S GOING TO BUY IT. THEY GOT MONEY. OKAY, WE GOT CUSTOMERS. HEY, POP. POP! YEAH? WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE? THESE KIDS GOT MONEY. WE GOT CUSTOMERS. ( laughs ) LOOKS GREAT. WHERE SHOULD I SIT? NOWHERE. THIS IS A DELI, NOT A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU PUT TABLES OUTSIDE, KIDS COULD HANG OUT. I DON’T WANT KIDS HANGING OUT. YOU’D SELL A LOT MORE SANDWICHES. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD PUT A TAKEOUT WINDOW OVER THERE BY THE MAGAZINE RACK, AND THEN KIDS COULD ORDER FROM THE SIDEWALK. THAT WAY, THE STORE STAYS FREE FOR SHOPPERS. NOT A BAD IDEA. GOT ANY ROOT BEER? I’LL GET IT FROM THE BACK. TAKEOUT WINDOW. MANNAGGI. HI, CHAD. HI, NICOLE. HI, BLAIR. HELLO, MRS. VENESSI. IS KAREN HERE? WHO WANTS TO KNOW? I’M NICOLE, HER BEST FRIEND. AH, THE ONE WHO DIDN’T TELL HER SHE WAS DUMPED FROM CHEERLEADING. CHAD, I GOT THE ROOT BEER-- NICOLE, BLAIR. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU HAD CHEERLEADING PRACTICE. UGH, YOU POOR THING. DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO SLICE SALAMI? HOW ELSE IS SHE GOING TO SELL IT, HUH? PIG’S FEET? OH, HOW DISGUSTING. GROSS. HAVE YOU SEEN THE TONGUE? THEY HAVE A TONGUE? FROM AN ANIMAL? YEAH, IT’S A REGULAR PET CEMETERY AROUND HERE. DON’T WORRY, ONLY 26 MORE DAYS, THEN YOU’RE OUT RIGHT AFTER THE PROM. HEY, IS DAVID TAKING ANYBODY? NICOLE, HE’S 17. HE’S NOT GOING TO OUR PROM UNLESS SOMEONE INVITES HIM. YOU’RE NOT THINKING OF INVITING-- IT WOULD BE SO COOL IF I SHOWED UP WITH AN OLDER GUY. NICOLE, DAVID DOESN’T LISTEN TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY GIRLS. HI, CHAD. YOU’RE NOT GOING TO STAY HERE, ARE YOU? YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF TABLES OUTSIDE, NOT A BAD IDEA. PAPA, PHIL’S FAMILY OWNED THIS PLACE FOR 50 YEARS WITHOUT TABLES. SO? SO. SO, A COUPLE OF TABLES OUTSIDE IS NOT A SIN. I MEAN, IT’S A DELI. IT’S NOT THE VATICAN. CAN I TAKE A BREAK? CHAD WANTS TO SHOW ME HIS SUIT FOR THE PROM. CAN’T YOU SEE WE'RE BUSY? BUT IT’S JUST OUT FRONT. THEN LET HIM GO GET IT! OKAY?! ( groans ) ( knock on door ) KAREN? LISTEN, UH...

LOOKS GREAT. MR. BALFOUR, WOULD IT BE OKAY IF TERRY JOINED THE PROM COMMITTEE? SURE, SURE, WE COULD USE AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN GET. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE’RE KIND OF SHORT ON CHAPERONES. YOU THINK MAYBE YOUR MOTHER MIGHT BE INTERESTED? I COULD ASK HER. GREAT, GREAT, HAVE HER GIVE ME A CALL. OR BETTER YET, KAREN, WHY DON’T YOU HAVE HER GIVE ME A CALL? HI, KAREN. TERRY, LOVE THE HAIR.

KAREN, I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU’VE DONE, BUT STOP TRYING TO TURN ME INTO SOMEONE YOU CAN BE SEEN WITH. YOU THINK THAT’S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO? I DON’T BELONG WITH A BUNCH OF CHEERLEADERS.

HOW DID YOU HELP HER? YOU KNOW, FIX HERSELF UP, NEW CLOTHES, NEW HAIR. REALLY? HOW DOES SHE LOOK? IN... CREDIBLE. SHE COULD EVEN GET A DATE TO THE PROM IF SHE WANTED. BUT IT’S LIKE SHE WON'T EVEN TRY. I KNOW. OH, MR. BALFOUR WANTS CHAPERONES FOR THE PROM. HE SAYS YOU SHOULD CALL HIM. MNH-MNH, NO, I CAN’T CHAPERONE THE PROM. WHY NOT? BECAUSE. BECAUSE. UH...

YOU CAN’T EVEN BE THERE UNLESS YOU’RE GOING. ARE YOU? KIND OF HARD TO GO TO THE PROM WITHOUT A DATE. WELL, THEN, GET ONE. YEAH, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT? THE ONLY GUY WHO TALKS TO ME AT SCHOOL IS LOUIS, AND HE’S... LOUIS. ( chuckles ) SO ASK SOMEBODY ELSE. SURE, NO PROBLEM. IF YOU DON’T MIND, I HAVE TO ANALYZE THE IRONY IN "GIFT OF THE MAGI." LOOK, TERRY, IT’S REALLY NO BIG DEAL. YOU JUST WALK UP TO THE GUY THAT YOU WANT. YOU SAY, "HI, YOU DON’T KNOW ME VERY WELL, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU’D LIKE TO GO TO THE PROM WITH ME." YEAH, AND THEN HE SAYS, "SURE, BUT FIRST CAN I DROP YOU OFF AT THE INSANE ASYLUM?" NO, NO, HE WON’T. GO AHEAD AND JUST TRY IT. TRY IT, PRACTICE ON ME. GO AHEAD. HI, YOU DON’T KNOW ME VERY WELL, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU’D LIKE TO GO TO THE PROM WITH ME. LOVE TO. YEAH, LIKE HE’D REALLY SAY THAT. I WOULD. JUST DID. YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THE PROM WITH YOU?
