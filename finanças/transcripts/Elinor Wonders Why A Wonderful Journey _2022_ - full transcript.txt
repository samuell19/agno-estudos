In fact, I used to babysit her when she was little. >> ELINOR: Aww, really? >> You'll really like her. She's an inventor.

Oh. >> And I'm Olive. >> Well, it's great to meet you, Ari and Olive. >> So, you invent things? >> (Chuckling) Yup! I'm an inventor. >> Hmm. >> I invented this, for example. And this. >> Whoa! >> Cool! >> Yup. I'm so glad I ran into you! But what are you doing all the way out here? >> Well, I think we took a wrong turn. We were headed for the camping area near Hidden Lake. >> Huh, that's where my camp is set up! (Gasping) Do you want to camp together? >> Okay, yeah! >> Yes, please! >> Hmm, you were supposed to turn at the creek. Huh. (Gasping) I bet I know why you missed it. Come on! >> Ah, I see. We missed the creek because it's dry. But that's odd. The creek shouldn't be dry this time of year. >> I did notice that a lot of the creeks on this side of the lake are dry. >> And we saw a dry creek in Animal Town, too! >> You're right, Elinor. Huh. >> Hmm, well, should we go back to the campsite? >> Sure, okay. >> Yeah. ♪ >> What brings you to Hidden Lake, Beatriz? >> Oh, I'm here to get ideas from nature for my inventions. >> Ideas from nature? >> Oh, yes! Nature is full of ideas. For example, I got the idea for this part when I was studying butterflies in the jungle last summer. I was out exploring when I noticed butterflies have a long mouth, called a proboscis, that rolls up, and I thought, "Oh! "What a great way to store something long." But then I thought, "Whoa, how can I use it to grab things?" So I looked for ideas in nature, and I learned that bird beaks are really strong and good for grabbing things. So I made this part just like a bird beak. >> Awesome! >> Cool! >> Beatriz was just like you, Elinor, when she was a little girl. She loved to ask lots of questions. >> Really, like me? >> Yes, and I still do. Look! And here we are. Hidden Lake. >> KIDS: Wow! >> Whoa. >> Follow me to the campsite. >> Wow. I don't think Beatriz could be any cooler. >> Oh, by the way, I brought way too many marshmallows with me. Do you want to help me eat them? >> Okay, I was wrong. Beatriz just got way cooler. (Giggling) (Geese squawking) >> And they didn't hear a sound. But then, when they opened the door... (Gasping) It was just a friendly butterfly. The end. >> Phew! Ow. (Giggling) >> Great story, Olive. >> Here you go, Ari. >> ARI: Thanks! >> What are you going to invent next, Beatriz? >> Ooh, I'm glad you asked, Elinor! I'm trying to invent a new kind of sticky tape, so I'm here to get ideas from frogs. >> Oh, we love frogs! >> But why frogs? >> Because of their tongues! Mmm! (Laughing) Frogs have very special tongues. Oh, I know! Why don't you come with me to observe them tomorrow? >> Really? >> Cool! >> You do know how to observe, right? >> Yep, observing means using your senses. Like looking and listening to notice and learn about things. >> That's right! >> Sounds like a plan. Let's get some rest now. >> Yes! ♪ >> This has been an awesome trip so far, Mom!

(Imitating frogs) >> Where are we going to look for frogs, Beatriz? >> Well, your mom told me that there's a spot near the lake that's always full of frogs. It's called the Frog Bog. (Croaking) I think it's... this way! >> Oho! >> Wow! Your inventions are so fun! >> Yeah, and you get your ideas from nature! >> Yep, you can find ideas almost anywhere, but I like to get my ideas from nature. >> Why nature, Beatriz? >> Because nature is full of ideas. Everywhere you look, nature has found a way to solve a problem or invent something useful. >> Like how you got the idea for how your stick rolls up from butterflies? >> Ah, yes, exactly! >> But how do you get the ideas? >> Well, you just have to be curious. >> Do you mean, ask questions? >> Mm-hm, exactly. If you have a problem or if you're just looking for ideas, all you have to do is just look around and ask yourself, why is this like this? Or how does that work? And you might learn something you didn't know before. >> Awesome. >> Yeah! >> Hmm. (Gasping) Ari, Olive! That's something else that asking questions is good for!

(Gasping) >> I have so many questions! >> That's great! That's how we get ideas, remember? Let's write what we observed in the notebook. Okay, what are you questions? >> Well, why does the frog stick out its tongue like that? >> Great question! Why do you think? >> ELINOR: Okay, the frog wants to eat the bugs. >> ARI: Yeah, but they're too far away to catch with its arms or legs. >> OLIVE: So it uses its long tongue to reach them! >> Ah, good thinking! >> Wow, that's amazing! >> Oh, how does the tongue catch the bugs? I didn't see it grab them. It just kinda stuck to them. >> Actually, Olive, that's the reason I came to study these frogs. Frogs have a special goopy saliva, that's the liquid in their mouth, that makes their tongue extra sticky. So I'm trying to invent a glue or tape that's sticky, just like the frog's saliva! >> Oh, that is so interesting! >> I have a question. How does the frog stick its tongue out so fast? (Grunting) >> Yeah. (Giggling) I can't do that. (Fly buzzing) >> I think I saw how it did it! The tongue was bent backwards first before it came out of the frog's mouth. >> Great observation, Olive. You're right, the frog bends its tongue back, and then uses its muscle to throw it at the bug. >> Wow, nature really is full of ideas. >> Well, I got a lot of amazing observations today. But I do wish there were more frogs. >> Yeah, Ranger Rabbit said there would be lots of frogs here. >> I wonder where did all the frogs go? Hmm, Beatriz, back in Animal Town, we saw a green frog that was lost because the creek was really dry. But it's not dry here. The plants sort of look like they're under water. Could that be the problem? >> Maybe there's too much water. Most frogs like places with just the right amount of water for them. They get used to it, and if it changes too quickly, they don't like it. >> That's it! Maybe there's too much water for the frogs, and that's why they're not here. >> Yeah, I wouldn't like it if my house filled up with water. But then again, I'm not a frog. >> Huh, you might be right. It looks like all this extra water is new, and that would explain why there aren't any frogs. But where is the water coming from? >> Could it be coming from the lake? >> Hmm, but why? >> Aww, poor frogs. If this is their home, then where are they going to go? >> Hmm. We have to help the frogs! >> OLIVE/ARI: Yeah! >> You're right, Elinor. Let's go back to the lake and see if we can figure out where all this water is coming from. (Frog croaking) ♪ >> Okay, I think I know what's happening. There's too much water in the lake and some of it is spilling over to the Frog Bog. That's why there's extra water there, which the frogs do not like. >> Yeah, the lake is definitely too full. >> But why does the lake have too much water? >> I don't know. >> Dun-dun-dun! It's a mystery! A watery mystery. >> Maybe it's been raining a lot. >> Good suggestion, but it hasn't rained here in a while. >> Oh, I know! Maybe a giant is pouring water into the lake from a giant bucket. (Laughing) >> Also a good suggestion, Ari, but do you see any giants? >> Hmm, no. >> KIDS: Hmm... >> I know! Let's observe the lake and see if we can figure it out. >> Great idea, Elinor. I'll draw the lake in my notebook. >> Yes, we need more observations! (Giggling) >> Hmm, I don't see anything that would make the lake have too much water. >> Me neither. >> Aww, not again. >> What's wrong, Olive? >> I'm trying to draw the lake but it keeps changing. >> Huh? >> Those sticks keep moving and I have to start all over again. >> Whoa, look at all those sticks floating in the water! >> They all seem to be going that way. >> That's so interesting! I wonder where they're going. >> What do you think we should do? >> Let's follow the sticks! Come on! >> Look, I see more and more sticks floating! >> Where are they all coming from? >> Huh, there they go. But where are they going? (Water trickling) >> Que es eso? Hold on, I hear something. >> Is it the giant? >> Hmm, follow me. (Water trickling) >> Huh, I thought I heard water trickling. It's trying to get through those sticks. >> That's where all the sticks are going! >> Yeah, they're floating down the lake and getting stuck on those rocks. >> Look at that big pile! It's stopping most of the water from getting through. >> Maybe that's why there's too much water in the lake. The sticks are blocking the water from going into the river so the water stays in the lake. >> Oh, just like my bathtub! >> Your bathtub? >> Yeah! If I put the plug in the drain, the water can't get out and the tub fills up. >> Oh, the lake is like your bathtub and this river is like the drain. >> Fantástico! I think you kids figured it out. Okay. There's water coming into the lake but the sticks are blocking the water from going out. So the water stays in the lake. >> And that's why there's too much water in the lake. >> Which is making the frogs' home fill up with water. >> That could be why the creeks you saw before are dry. The sticks are blocking the water from getting to them. >> We have to get the sticks out! >> Yeah, they're changing the frogs' home here and in Animal Town. >> We have to un-stick the situation. (Giggling) >> I think I might know where the sticks are coming from. Ranger Rabbit, come in, Ranger Rabbit. >> Hi, Beatriz, is everything okay? >> Everything is fine, but the kids and I have discovered a problem. >> Oh, what is it? >> There are a lot of sticks in the lake and they're blocking the water from going to the river. >> Hmm, well, that would explain why the creeks were dry. >> Yes, and it's also causing the Frog Bog to flood. Ranger Rabbit, did you say you're moving a lot of sticks for the new road? >> Why, yes, but... Oh, I see! The sticks are falling into the river and floating down into the lake! Okay, we'll move the stick pile right away. That should stop anymore sticks from coming down to block the water. >> BEATRIZ: Great, thank you, Ranger Rabbit. Okay, your mom is going to stop anymore sticks from coming to the lake. >> Phew! But what do we do about the sticks that are already here? >> We need to find a way to get them out so the water can go through again. >> Hmm, but how do we reach them? >> I could fly over and pull them. >> Thanks, Ari, but that might not be safe. >> I have an idea! Maybe you can use your invention to get the sticks, Beatriz! >> You mean the grabber? Let's try it! ♪ >> Aw, it's too short. >> That's okay, not every idea works. We just need to keep trying. >> Hey, I wonder if asking questions can help! Asking questions is good for exploring and is good for getting ideas. Maybe it's good for solving problems too. >> Yes! Asking questions is very helpful when you're trying to solve a problem. Let's do it! Okay, the first question you should ask is, "What's the problem?" >> Hmm, I can draw it in my notebook. We need to move the sticks. But we're here, and the sticks are way over there. It's too far for us to reach. >> That's great, Olive! It always helps to draw the problem. Now the next step is to come up with ideas for solving it. What can we use to reach the sticks? >> We could try to be like the frog! The frog used its tongue to reach the bugs that were far away. >> Yes! >> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You think we need to use our tongues to get the sticks? (Grunting) (Laughing) (Coughing) >> I am not doing that. >> I think Elinor means that we need to make Beatriz's invention a lot longer. Just like the frog's tongue. >> Ah-hah, an idea from nature! Me encanta! I love it! >> But how can we make your grabber longer? Wait, I know! Beatriz, do you still have those ropes in your backpack? >> I sure do! >> Maybe we can use a rope to help the grabber reach the sticks. >> Now it's really long, like a frog's tongue. >> Fantástico! Let's see how it works. Uno, dos, tres! >> Aww, it still doesn't reach! I really thought that was going to work. >> Me too. >> We can't give up, the frogs need our help! Let's keep trying. >> Elinor is right, let's keep trying. >> What other question can we ask? >> We could ask how the frog does it. How does it get its tongue so far out? >> That's it, Ari! To learn from nature, it's important to ask how and why something does the thing it does. >> Wait, I have my drawing. The frog bent its tongue back, and then the tongue went flying out. >> How can we do that? >> Hmm, good question-- Whoa! >> Did you see that? The tree bent back and pushed Ari up into the air! >> Just like the frog's tongue! Maybe we can use the tree to throw our grabber to the sticks. >> Ah, it's a nature-inspired invention. Okay. Everyone, help me pull. (Grunting) >> Yes, it worked! (Giggling) (Grunting) >> We have to pull harder! >> It came loose! Yay! >> Awesome! >> Let's pull another stick. ♪ (Grunting) (Grunting) >> All the sticks are falling down! >> And the water is getting through! (Cheering) >> We should tell my mom. >> Yes! Ranger Rabbit, come in, Ranger Rabbit. >> Hi, Beatriz, how is it going down there? >> Together with my super team of inventors, we moved the sticks and the water is flowing again. >> Wow, how did you do it? >> We did it by asking questions! Questions are good for exploring, for getting ideas, and for solving problems! >> And where did we get all these great ideas? >> KIDS: From nature! >> That's amazing! I can't wait to hear about it tonight. I'll help Deputy Mouse finish up here and I'll meet you back at the campsite. >> Roger that, Ranger Rabbit. See you tonight. >> Bye, Mom! >> We did it! >> Yeah! >> Yep, you all asked such great questions, and that helped us come up with ideas and solutions. I am so proud of you! >> I think there's less water in the lake now. >> The frogs! Come on, let's go check on them. >> Yeah! ♪ >> Look, now you can see more of the plants. >> Yeah, it looks like it has just the right amount of water. (Frog croaking) (Gasping) >> We did it, the frogs are coming back! >> Welcome home, froggies. Wow, I can't believe those sticks made such a big change. >> It's true, when something happens in one place, it can change things for plants and animals in other places. Everything is connected in nature, even us. >> Ah! >> That's why we need to help nature whenever we can. Especially when we're the ones that caused the change. Come on, let's get back to the campsite. >> KIDS: Yeah! ♪ (Giggling) >> All right, I think we're ready to go. >> Where are you going now, Beatriz? >> Wherever nature takes me! I just ask questions and explore. >> Kids, I think this might be a good time to say goodbye to Beatriz. >> Well, I had a lot of fun exploring with all of you. It was great to meet you, Ari. >> Yeah, me too. Ooh, I have an idea for a new invention! >> What is it? Pickles with marshmallows. >> Oh... let me know how that turns out. And it was so nice to meet you too, Olive. Did you finish your drawing of the lake? >> Sure did! Look. And that's us exploring. >> Que bello! It's beautiful. >> That's amazing, Olive. >> I hope you two keep having interesting ideas and keep drawing. >> We will! >> And it was really special to see you, Elinor. Aw, you're so grown up! I hope you had fun on this trip. (Giggling) >> Yes, I learned so much! Especially about asking questions. >> Well, I hope you never stop wondering. It's always good to listen to that little voice inside all of us that wants to know why things happen and how things work. >> We all have a little bit of wonder inside. >> We sure do, so never stop asking questions. Who knows, maybe you'll grow up to be a scientist. Or a ranger, like your mom. >> Or an inventor, like you! >> You can be anything you set your curious mind to, Elinor. That's for sure. >> Bye, Beatriz! >> Bye! >> Good luck on your next invention! >> Adios, see you! >> Remember, pickles and marshmallows! >> See you later!

(Croaking) (Fly buzzing) (Gasping) (Giggling) >> Hi, Elinor. What are you doing? >> Let me guess, are you wondering about something? >> Yes, I am! I wonder why do frogs like to hop? >> What do you mean? >> They have really long legs. Why don't they just walk? >> I don't know, maybe because they don't have shoes? >> Or maybe because hopping is just more fun. (Giggling) (Laughing) >> I know, let's observe them and see if we can figure this out. >> Yes, we need more observations! Salta, ranita, salta!
