- Hello, nonie. - Hello, father. How do you feel now, Peggy? - Oh, much better, father. Holy oils have revived me, same as last time. - The last rites are not medicine, Peggy. Dr. Brady's your man for that. He could never cure me. I don't know what I'll do when. You're gone back to Rome. - The Latin prayer, father. - Oh. - Snow's bad up here. It's only yourself and the wireman able for a day like this. - Thank you, nonie. God bless. - Thanks very much, father. - One by one now. Up. Up. - Push it. Steady. Come on, hey. - Hello, father. - It is all evidence of the power of the almighty working through the mind of man. I know some of you are still wary of these machines. Don't be. Electricity is one of the great blessings of our time. In lumine tuo. Videbimus lumen. In thy light shall we see light. - Amen. Amen. - Eileen, the floor is yours. - Right, well, we're going to start by learning how to bake some scones. - You sure that thing is safe now? - Oh, don't worry, Catherine, 'tis as safe as your range. Safer, in fact. - And much, much cleaner. - What do you think, miss Courtney? - Well, it doesn't do anything that the range doesn't do. - I'm planning to get one for the parochial house. It will be my parting gift to you. Thank god we lived to see the day. Amn't I right, Brendan? Modern conveniences, properly supervised and used for the right purpose, can be a great help to our people. - Isn't Brendan sounding more and more like our beloved be valera every day, Emmet? - Ding-dong, ding-dong. Look at that. Magic. - Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It's been three weeks since my last confession, father. I took the name of the lord in vain... Many times. I was late for mass last Sunday. - For your penance, say three hail Marys. - Sorry, father. I'm not finished yet. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Carry on. - Bless me, father, I have sinned. It's been a week since I've been in confession. I said a bad word three times. - Momento. Per favore. Um... What we have to remember about gregorian chant is its utter majesty. It's done with love. Amore. - It's done with affection. Afecto. - Afecto. - So let's go at it again. One more time. - So are you expecting the good - news soon then, father? - I am, miss Courtney. - Please god. - Please god. - Would you like to come along, father? - I will. Your grace. I trust that everything is still in order for my return to Rome. Yes, Rome, father. Do you really want to go back there? - I'd dearly love to complete my thesis on Saint John of the cross. - You were happy enough to leave Rome at the time. "A dolt of an Italian brought right in over your head." - Isn't that what you told me? - I hope I didn't put it like that. In any case, I've been here for three years, your grace. - Being an Irish parish priest is not a penance. - I'm sorry. - You consider yourself to be - an intellectual, don't you? - Well... - You do, and you are. A cut above US plain muck - savages. - No, no, your grace. - Oh, yes. I'm sorry, father Barry. It's going to take longer than I thought. They're a law unto themselves over there in the Vatican. In the meantime, help me to build a new church in your parish. - A new church? - Yes, it's time. - Holy Trinity could use some repairs, but it's still a magnificent old... - Oh, it's not worth doing up. Better to start anew. You should be very good with money, father, having spent 20 years in america. Did you not pick up the knack? Picture it, standing tall and majestic. The biggest building in the whole town. Thank you, Sean. This is what needs to happen with every parish in the diocese. Let US give lie to the notion that our country is stagnating. I see a vibrant, holy nation on the move. - How much have you raised, father Keenan? - Â£4,860. - It's a start. - Very good. Very good. Ned? Now then, we need to get going on the funds. This raffle will get you started. Once you start the fund-raising, it'll snowball. And Rome will be there for you - after the job is done. - Father Barry. Have we forgotten something? - If you were to ask for my opinion, I would say that Rome is too far away and that you've been there before. But that would be me. Oh, I love raffles. - Hello. - Hello, Joey. - Hello. - Joey. You look after the shop? I want to go upstairs - for a minute, okay? - Yeah. - Seems like a very nice little town. - Soft enough for you? - Oh, yes. Yes, it is. It's fine. I'll take it. But that's if I get the job, of course. - I'll need you to pay weekly. - Oh, that won't be a problem. I can give you - a week in advance. - Good luck with the interview then. Excuse me a minute. - Thank you. - What's gonna happen when daddy comes home for Christmas? - Where's he gonna sleep? - Where he always does. Mr. Lynch won't be here. He'll go home for Christmas. I'm sure your father will be home by then. You'll be all right. - Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It's a week since my last confession. I took the lord's name in vain last Thursday afternoon. I was envious of my neighbor's new belongings. - What sort of belongings? - An enamel bucket and a bright red plastic basin. - Is there anything else? - Yes. I committed the sin of pride. I thought I looked lovely in my new skirt. - Do you have any passions, Mr. Devoy? - Passions? - Hobbies. - Oh. - Sport. - You play hurling, don't you? - Yes. - I've had a number of temporary teaching jobs in Dublin. I'm ready for something - more permanent now. - And why borris, Mr. Lynch? - Well, why not, Mr. Mcsweeney? From what I hear, it's a town - with a lot going for it. - You're 27? - 27 last month. - You don't look it. - That's what they tell me. - And what did you get up to in Dublin? Now, that'd be telling. I have very wide interests, Mr. Mcsweeney. Music, sports, the pictures. Dublin was great for the pictures. I was impressed, by the way, to find out that Rex ingram's - people came from around here. - Who? - Rex ingram, the, famous filmmaker who went off to Hollywood. - You know, the protestant rector's son who went off to become a director. - What's your favorite ingram film? - Well, I haven't seen them all. I like the four horsemen of the apocalypse, of course, but I have to say I have a very soft spot for the prisoner of zenda. - I think we've heard enough. - We have indeed. Congratulations, Mr. Lynch. - And welcome to borrisokane. - Thank you. - I think that was a bit hasty, father. Especially as you're leaving US soon. - I've decided to stay amongst you a bit longer, Brendan. I knew that would make you happy. - Miss Courtney said I'd find you here. - She thinks I need an audience. A new lens for the projector. I wanted to see how big an image I could get. The parochial house is not the - best place to show films. - And the church is? Just wanted to say thanks for the job. - You settling in all right? - Yes, thanks. Very well. The dome of Saint Peter's. - Have you been to Rome? - No. Sorry. - The Vatican library. I lived and worked there for years. The bishop's decided I'm not to go back there till I build a new church here. - So what's he like, his grace? - The bishop likes building new churches. He has a countryman's passion for concrete. - Fontana di trevi. One of the most beautiful plazas in the world, I think. - You know, there's a legend that if you throw a coin in the fountain, - you'll return to Rome one day. - That's my coin. - Well, they say the money goes towards good works. Well, I'd better be - getting back. - All right. Oh, thanks, once again, father. - "Most of these Hollywood stories and the manner of their telling are alien to our Gaelic culture and way of life. Hard work and family commitments are put aside to give way to debauchery and sin. It is therefore of the utmost importance that we preserve our own native stories, customs, and games, and insofar as possible, reject the doubtful and often downright malign influence of what is not native to US. Yours sincerely in Christ, Terence hegerty, "bishop of the diocese." The bishop's pastoral will be published in next week's paper, of course, so you may read it in detail at your leisure. Now, may I remind you once again that we are making very little progress with our building fund for the new church. Could you please give generously today? Thank you, and god bless. And now, please stand for the credo. - God bless, Catherine. - Thank you, father. - Eileen, do you suppose the electricity supply board might consider throwing a few shillings our way - for the new church? - I don't know. I mean, the board gets so many requests for sponsorship. They do, but I'm a great supporter. In fact, I think sometimes they should be paying me for helping sell their cookers and blessing the power lines. - I'll inquire, father. But I can't promise anything. Thank you, Eileen. - Tim. - I enjoyed your film show the other night. Do you ever think about showing - your films at the hall? - What do you mean? - Well, put them on a double bill with a good western. - Good way to pass the winter. - Kieran, god bless. - Sorry, father. - How are you father? - Hello, John. - Thanks, father. - Thank you. Lads. That's all I've got. She's taken it all off me, - father. - I'll have one ticket, father. - Thank you, Liam. - Pity you're not in with the g.A.A. Crowd, father. They'd be a great help - with the fund-raising. - "Meagher", with a "g." - No interest in the game, father? - They didn't go in for the hurling in Rome? - No. - Last priest we had here was great at the g.A.A. - Father Malone. - Thank you, Liam. - I hear you're not leaving US after all, father. - Not for a while. - Aren't you better off? Isn't the world outside our shores in a calamitous condition these days? - And what would you know about - it no more than myself? - For god's sake, - would you shut... - I was able to read the street signs when we were over in London. Didn't have to go around sniffin' the air - like a lost mongrel. - Hey. Who's a lost mongrel? - You came back home soon enough with your tail - between your legs. - At least I had a good home - to come back to. - And so we come to borris... Where progress has been rather slow. - Isn't that so, father Barry? - It is, your grace. - So did you get the raffle under way? - I did. But it just hasn't taken off yet. - Stingy crowd in borris, are they? - No, no, your grace. There just isn't that much money there. - But they still want their new church, don't they? They do, of course. - So what other plans have you? It'll soon be the start of a new year, and we need to - keep the momentum going now. - Pictures. - You what? - I was thinking about - having a picture show... Shows. - Pictures? Your films. I see. Father Barry's a dab hand with the cine-camera, a habit he picked up over in Hollywood, I think. - Catholic university in. Washington's hardly Hollywood, your grace. - Father Barry spent 20 years over in the land of the free. He's a real wayfarer. So do you think they'll part with their pennies to go and see - your little films? - Oh, not just my films, your grace. I was thinking of hiring, you know, proper films. - You've read my pastoral letter on that topic? - Oh, I have, of course. - Of course you have. Well, provided they're suitable. And now to Clare. - We'll put a brand-new modern screen here, of course, as large as we can fit in. There'll be rows and rows of raised seats at the center... Pullman seats... The sort you'd find in Dublin, with aisles on both sides. - Have you given any thought to the effect these pictures will have on people? - Oh, I have, Brendan. They'll be a source of enlightenment and entertainment - to young and old alike. - Bishop hegerty might not agree with you there. - You shouldn't presume to know the bishop's mind. - So this has bishop hegerty's imprimatur? - Imprimi protest. Censor librorum non postulo. - The bishop is a plain-speaking man. - I'll tell him you said so. - And why is he present? He's not on the committee. - No, but it was his idea. Now, naturally, the projection room will be up there. And des, that'll be your responsibility. And Willie, you'll be the one to advise on the building works. - I have serious moral objections to this enterprise. - Would a good confession help? - There are people in this town struggling to put bread on the table, and what are we offering them? A picture house. - The soul is fed by many things, Brendan. - I can find ample food for my soul in the church, father. - So what do you want to call it? - The Stella... - For star. - You could call it the garden of Allah in honor of Rex ingram. Yeah. Is it warm enough? - Oh, it'll warm up nicely now. Oh, that's great. - Hi, auntie Eileen. - Hiya, Molly. - What's that yoke? - An electrical shaving mug. - What's it do? - Heats water. - We're waiting for it to heat up. - That's all? - Well, it's not selling too well. I don't really know why. Go on. It's ready now. - Best shave you've ever had? - Perfect. - I'm your auntie's Guinea pig. - Everyone will soon have hot water on tap. Why would you use a thing like that? - People like shiny things. - Well, I suppose it could come in handy - if you're out some place. - Like where? Out in the fields? You just plug it into a rock? - I better go. I might take you with me next time I'm trying to sell that thing. See you later, Molly. Come on, Joey, you come with me. - How does it work, auntie Eileen? - I don't understand. - What? - In nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti. Congratulations, Brendan. We might be seeing you in the national parliament soon. That'll be the will of the people, father. The will of the people, - of course. - And the will of god. All I know is that the place is in sore need of stewardship. That'll be the cornerstone of my election campaign. Father. - If you pledge a regular amount, you'll be a sponsor with your name in the program. - And that's good for business. - All proceeds - go to the cinema fund? - They do. - Put me down for one pound ten shillings. So we'll see what happens. - You're a hard woman, Sally. - I'd need to be, father. You'd do well to be a bit cautious yourself. - Thank you, and god bless. - God bless. - Brendan, this is Sean I was telling you about, Sean o'Flaherty. - Michael, how are you? - Hello, father. - Good to see you. Stephen, is it? - It is, father. - Oh, right. Could you afford to make a small donation to the cinema fund, please? - Ladies. May I have this dance? - You may. - Two lemonades. We have glasses. No need to dirty another pair. - Do you have real drink under that counter? - I think you've had enough already. - You think you're something, don't you? Better than the rest of US? Now that the priest is getting you to show films. - Glad you could take the time - to join US, Brendan. - People don't have much to - give these days. - It's a means to an end. - Is this how you got round the bishop? - Do you see Maureen O'Connell making eyes at everyone? - Eileen, would you like to dance? - Yes, please. - Molly, will you mind it? - Look who Eileen's with over there. - I hear from my son that you're a good teacher. We labor for life in a small, country town. Look ahead 10 years, 20, 50 even. They say the world might end in the year 2000. But if it doesn't, what'll this town be like then? It's in our power to shape it. We need young men like you. Would you ever think of joining the party? - What's brought this on, Brendan? - I think you could go far. That Eileen, she's a nice girl. Bright. But she needs to settle down soon. - I bet now you'd rather be at home listening to Renata tebaldi singing on your gramophone. - It's been a great night. - Between you and me, I'd swap it all for a few bars of Artie Shaw. - Jazz! That's a matter for confession, Tim. - Â£850? We've barely Â£270 in the restoration fund, and Brendan mcsweeney isn't going to let US touch that without a fight. - I mean, Â£800... - Â£850, des. Don't be afraid to say it. If we don't move now, we won't be open for easter. And of course, there will be ample opportunity to show films of an educational nature... Handcrafts, beekeeping, butter-churning, safety first, and so on. The Stella will be a fount of knowledge. - And what about the filth and immorality, father? - There'll be none of that, Julia. - Well, I think we should give it a chance. - All I'm saying is, once something like that is turned on, it's hard to turn off. - Brendan is against it, isn't he? - I'm saying what I think myself here now. It's nothing to do with Brendan. - Sure, we'll know soon enough if we're being corrupted... - By the beekeeping films. - It's not films about beekeeping that they're queuing up to see in nenagh. - Here, on the edge of Europe, on the edge of the world, the people of aran live and praise his name, daily putting their trust in god. - This is a sacred place. - The bishop sent it down. Thought father might consider - opening the Stella with it. - I'm giving it - serious consideration. - That's the last - of the Italian coffee now. - Aye. - Thank you, miss Courtney. - You still want to - go back to Rome? - Untouched by the changes that make our world more dangerous by the day. This happy, holy community show US what... - They made a 28-year-old the head curator after I'd been promised that position. - Try and be like them. - He was Italian, of course. - Pray like them. - Oh, I still have my pride. - So you kicked up - a bit of a fuss? - Oh, I did. And I ended up here. - The truth is not to be found in our bright and sinful cities. - Could have been worse. - You could have ended up - in the aran islands. - The truth is here amidst this chaste people. We should strive to make the whole world like aran. - It's a pity you didn't devote more time to the bishop's pastoral last Sunday. - People can do that for themselves. - As you well know, the majority, unfortunately, are either too illiterate or too indolent to sit down and read an important document like that. - The people need to be educated, to be told. After hundreds of years of foreign occupation, we finally have the freedom to fashion a country of our own making. Safe and self-sufficient. - Saint Patrick would have had - a hard time with you. - Saint Patrick? - Wasn't he an outsider? - Saint Patrick wasn't trying to sneak in Hollywood filth. You need to get the people fired up. They're crying out for a guiding light. - "The light of hope, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, to all of US." - Saint Francis of assisi. - Charlie chaplin, the great dictator. - Come on, let's go see the tree. It's huge, isn't it? - Very christmassy. Love the tree, by the way. - Thank you. - I hope it's all right, me sticking around through the holidays. - Well, your mother'll be disappointed you didn't get home for Christmas. - Oh, she'll be grand. What with my sisters, cousins, aunts, there'll be no room for me anyway. âª The wren, the wren âª âª the king of all birds âª âª Saint Stephen's day âª âª was caught in the furze âª âª up with the kettle âª âª and down the pan âª âª give me a penny âª âª to Bury the wren âª âª if you haven't a penny âª âª a 'penny will do âª âª if you haven't a 'penny âª âª god bless you âª - You make a fine looking pair, Molly. - So what happened to Jimmy? - Typical of him not to turn up, not even for Christmas. - Joey, are you there? Maybe he'll be home for easter. - Hello, father. - God bless the work. Remember, man, thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. Remember, man, thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. - Doesn't it look great? - What about the holy oils while you're at it? I can't keep anointing you for the same illness, Peggy. - But it's a different illness this week, father. - Okay, so nonie, here's the on switch. And there's six different heat levels. One being the lowest; Six being the highest. - It's very simple. - Try it so. - Well, now, we have to wait till Gerry's finished - connecting the wires. - All done. - You're now connected to the national grid. - Oh, no. Let father Barry be the one. And say a prayer now before you do it, father. - I've nothing prepared. Um... Grant, o lord, we beseech thee, - that the light enter in this... - No, no, father. Speak your lovely Latin. - Gloria patris, et filio, et spiritui sancto, sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Amen. - Are we ready? Click! - Is there really another life, father? - Oh, Peggy, of course there is. - Well, what is heaven? - Why, heaven - is the face of god. - And where is it? We know where we are. But we don't know where we're going, isn't that it? - Grab it. I dare you. - No, I can't. - Do it! - Joey's afraid. - Leave me alone. - What'll you do about it? Do you think your daddy in London will hear you if you shout? - It has to go all the way... - Yeah. - And is this then, a banner? - âª La da-da di da âª - Lads, come on. - Thank you, Willie. God bless, man. - Come on, Frankie, let's go! - What's this? - My daddy used to work here too, you know... Before he went to england. He made things no one else could. - Can I go now? - You can. But you may have to become a priest now. If the hat fits. - But it didn't fit. And I'm only nine. - I wasn't much older than you - when I got the call. - Who called you? - Well, who do you think? Himself, of course. - Well, how'd you know? Did you see a light - or something? - Oh, no, no light. Just happened. - But I knew. - Father. - Thanks, lads. - Was your mommy happy when it happened? She was, - of course. - Did you hear a voice? - I did... - In a manner of speaking. - In your head? - From inside me, yes. - Well, what did it say? - What did what say? - The voice from inside you. - It said, "come, follow me." But it was the voice of god, all right. Let's go. - All right, we'll walk it in. Whoops. Gently. - Now... - Say the word. - It's now or never. Soon your... your fridge will be there, your washing machine here, your electric clothes dryer over there, and a hoover under the stairs. Invisible heat. Constant. Always under control, sure. And that's the beauty of it. Isn't it great that - we've seen the day? - You play outside, Joey. - Well, thanks a million, des. - Any time. Come on, son. You can help me carry this stuff around to the hall. Hold the door open for me there. - Well, how do I look? - Perfect. Jane Wyman in all that heaven allows. I didn't see that one. It makes everything else in here look so old. - Does that include me? - Maybe not you. I want it all... Now. A fitted kitchen like you'd see in a picture. It sounds silly, doesn't it? Dreaming of an electric house, and look at the state I'm in. - Last year, before you, before all of this, I was perplexed at what the - future might hold for me. - Oh, bishop hegerty's - new church? - Do you ever wonder if you chose the right path in life, Tim? - Every morning when I face the little monsters. You see, you're allowed to say that. I'm not. - Brendan has won the election. - His election speech. - Tea, gentlemen? - "I want to make education and the moral welfare of our young people my number one priority. I'm referring now to a misguided plan to open a picture house, spearheaded by a member of the clergy. Precious time and scarce resources "are being wasted on..." - Et cetera, et cetera. - I have had complaints from some of the parents. I have to remain neutral, not antagonize any section of the community. - You have to stand up to cretins like Brendan. - It's not that simple. - It is. - I'm sorry, Tim, but it's not. It never was. Father, if you could maybe try to bring him on side before he gets to the bishop. - How blind can people be? Electing someone like that to high office? It'd make you question the very idea of democracy. - People like Brendan capitalize on fear. - The people, they're afraid of everything. There's not a grain of confidence left in the country. But you're still more powerful than he is, Daniel. You have the authority of the church. That's still the last word. - It's about responsibility, Tim. It isn't about authority. But it is. You're the parish priest. You can do whatever you like. - Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It's a week since my last confession. I took the lord's name in vain last Thursday. I was late for mass on Sunday. I lost my temper... - Father. - Good day, father. - Thank you very much. - You're most welcome. - You had no business saying that in your election speech. - I'm not without influence, father. You shouldn't dismiss people like me too lightly. Power's a very fragile thing. It can slip away when you least expect it to. - Is that a threat, Brendan? - Can you not see that we're on the same side? You've had three long years to establish your authority here. You have singularly failed in that task. You leave me no alternative but to bring the matter to the attention of the bishop. - You may bring the matter to the attention of the pope, for all I care. - The bishop is a man who cares about the moral well-being of the Irish people. - I've spoken to them in Dublin - about the projector. - Don't tell me they don't have one! - Oh, they have one, all right. But he's wanting payment. Half now, and half - when it's delivered. - There's no trust left - in the country. - It's more than we have in the account, father. - Then we'll take it out of the church restoration fund. We'll put it back later, with interest. It would be open every night of the week, with a matinee on Saturday and Sunday. It might even help keep them out of the pubs. And do you know how much the ormond in nenagh brings in every week? - All I know about the ormond is that I have to check the paper every week to make sure they don't show any filth there. - You won't have that problem - with the Stella, your grace. - And they're for - this picture house, your flock? - Oh, they are. - The majority. - Oh, majorities, minorities. That sort of language is not within our realm. - Your grace, most of the Irish people are still a hair's breath from paganism. - And a picture house will make - them more... god-fearing? - In a strange sense, it could, yes. As a modern tool... To help civilize them. - Mind you don't break that statue. - I won't break it. - I think I have a calling. - What? - From the holy ghost. I want to be a priest. I'll hear your confession. That's the first duty of a newly ordained priest. - I think that's communion you're thinking of. - I'll hear your confession. Too. You will not. Joey, you're nine years old. How can you know what you want to be? What put all this - into your head? - I heard a voice inside me. - What am I gonna do with you, - What's wrong with you, des? - This is perfect. - Don't make it look too perfect now. - Jimmy. - Who's this? - How did you get here? - Got to Dublin yesterday. - Got a lift down. - I'm Tim. - Are you? - It gives me great pleasure to announce that we have raised Â£108, 4 shillings, - and 7 pence here tonight. - What the fuck - is all this about? - Which brings our cinema fund to over Â£1,200. We're well on course to open the Stella on easter Sunday night, please god. - Saw they're closing them down in London, cinemas. TV is the big thing now. 17-inch. - We're going home. - Tim is staying with US. - Is he? - He's a lodger. - I'm a schoolteacher. - A lodger? We don't have room for lodgers. - I had to make room, Jimmy. I needed the money. - The prodigal, the return. Welcome back then, James. Good to see you. - You're coming with me. - Jimmy! - Why didn't you tell me about this? - Tell you? I didn't even have an address for you for months. - I knew the minute I walked - in the door and saw you. - Knew what? - That you shamed me in there, - talking about money. - I... - How long has he been - fuckin' ridin' you? - I think we better get you home now, James. - Are you staying with her too? - You've no right to be carrying on like this, Jimmy. There's nothing... - Get Dr. Brady down here! - I'm all right. - You're back two minutes, and look what you done. - Look at the cut of you! - Fuck off, you! - Oh, lovely, the Teddy boy language and all. - Come on. - I don't want to go home with a whore. - Go home with your wife now, James. - You can't tell me what to do. I'm not afraid of priests anymore... Or sour old craw-thumping cunts! - Get him out of here. - Fuck the lot of you! - I met nonie Cassidy in the shop, father. She says Peggy's not the best. - Wants you to go down and see her. - Not now. - Well, your anointing oils. - Father, father! Bishop hegerty's on the phone. - Thank you. Yes, your grace. - Father, what about Peggy? - Father. - What did I tell you, des? Bye-bye, picture house. - Des! - Are you all right there, Larry? - Look at that lunatic! He's turned into a lunatic. - I'd say mcsweeney blew it all out of... - Oh, never mind mcsweeney. the most powerful man in that community. Your authority must be unquestioned. Unquestioned! You told me the cinema would have a civilizing influence. Instead, we have chaos. Now, I've been told that you are buying magic lantern machines and spending money left, right, and center. All paid for out of the church restoration fund. - Yes, your grace. - How much money have you spent - on this business so far? - About Â£1,000. - Â£1,000? - Yes, your grace. - Do you know how much concrete we could buy for Â£1,000? Do you understand what we are about at all, father? This is a constant, never-ending battle for the control of hearts and minds. And it's a battle we could lose. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but... We have to keep one step ahead of them all the time. - Poor Peggy's gone. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb... - I'm so sorry for your trouble, nonie. - Too late now, father. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Glory be to the father, and to the son, and to the holy spirit. - As it was in the beginning. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. - Jeremiah will be one of how many other boys? - 12. - 12 new priests. How exciting. - Is this Jeremiah? - No, father. That is Daniel. - What do you want, Daniel? - Nothing father. - Well, away with you then. - Will ye settle down, will ye? Today we will talk about viking longships coming towards shore, filled with armed men. No. Let me see. Oh, yes. Today we will talk about picture houses and how to be a whore. Hand me that chalk. Well, to be a whore in this town, you have to be Joey's mommy. - Slap! - Get back to your seat! - Stop it. You're murdering it! Can you not listen to one another? Can you not do it for each other? Can you not do it for me? Can you not hear yourself, Julia? - We're clearly not good enough for you, father. Oh, and father... Did you hear your teacher friend got the sack today? - Is it true, Emmet? - Yes, father. - You had no right to do that. - With respect... - I am the chairman of the school board. No one is dismissed here without my approval. - It was an emergency meeting. We tried to find you, but... Brendan mcsweeney... - That craw-thumping ignoramus has no authority to dismiss anyone. Tim, go back to your classroom - with my apologies. - Father... - I will not see an innocent man's name discredited by a spineless coward! - With respect, father, I don't think this is wise. - Come in. - Thanks for standing up for me like that. Been a strange few months. You never know the way things are gonna turn out. I've been very happy here. I... Living there, with her... - She really didn't believe at all. Peggy Cassidy. All the years, all the prayers. It was only fear. - What I'm trying to say, Daniel, is... - That young priest in Rome who was promoted above me, he was, in fact, a brilliant scholar. But my pride wouldn't allow me to admit that. God forgive me, I hated him for his youth, his clarity. And I know I'm mocked behind my back here for my Latin and my lingua italiana. They think it's all a put-on, but it isn't. I was taken out of the world when I was 12 years of age. This is such a desperate place, Tim. I thought it might be real in some way. But it's just damp and poor in every sense. I don't know what would have become of me if you hadn't been here this winter, to have someone to talk with. At that time, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the sea of galilee and a great crowd followed him. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. The Jewish passover festival was near. When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him, he said to Philip, "where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?" Philip answered him, "it..." Philip answered him, "it would take more than..." Recently, someone asked me "where is heaven, father?" I told them that heaven was the face of god, but I knew that they were looking for something more familiar, a place. We seek comfort in what is known, it seems. And sure, didn't our savior himself tell US that, "in my father's house, there are many mansions"? For my own part, I believe that heaven dwells in our humanity. And that is why it is so wrong to judge others. There is a young man here among US who was recently scandalized by idle gossip. This is the sort of rash judgment that tears apart the fabric of a community and that... that makes US distrust one another. - What's he on about? - Then slowly but surely, we begin to see clearly the simple fault in our neighbor while we remain blind to the great fault within ourselves. - It's like watching a man hang himself. - And... - That's Tim? They sacked him - because of that fight? - The thing is, - Jimmy was right. - Right? About what? What are you trying to tell me, Molly? - I think I fell in love with him, Eileen. - Tim? - Does he know about this? - Of course, he does. - We... - Oh, god. Oh. Joey. Where is he? - Change is coming to this country, Daniel. Our holy church will not be in second place much longer. Believe me now. You will have great power and influence in this land very soon. Father Daniel Barry. - I'm very sorry. I'm not hearing confessions - right now. - I'm not here for confession. - Please, go away, Brendan. - I don't know where your place is in the world, but it isn't here, father. You don't know US. You don't know what we need. For three long years, I have tried to explain my people's wants and needs to you. I foolishly thought we were on the same side. I could have been the saving of you if you took my advice. You have put yourself above the needs of your people! Go home. There is no priest here. - Come on. - Watch your back. - Aye, I will. - Well, if it isn't sergeant warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet. - I am wet. - If you're looking for the - captain, he isn't here. - And if I'm not - looking for him? - He still isn't here. - Well, I'm looking for him. You know where he is? - I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town on business. That's the way you put it the other day, isn't it? That's what I like about you, sergeant, you have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you. - It's not confidence, ma'am, it's honesty. I just hate to see a beautiful - woman going all to waste. - Waste, did you say? There's a subject I might tell you something about. I know several kinds of waste. - Has anyone seen Joey? - No, I haven't. - You're probably not even remotely aware of some of them. - Would you like to hear? - Joey? - For instance, what about the house without a child? There's one sort for you. Then there's another. What are you doing? - I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want? - I don't know, sergeant. I don't know. - I tried talking to Daniel. I tried to tell him. - He just kept talking about himself. - He knows. - We was just testing the projector. - Des! What are you doing? Des, shut down the projector. And who was it who opened the cinema? - Well, the seats were delivered, and they sent a roll of film down to test the projector. - I'm sorry. - Let's go up to Mrs. Kipper's parlor and sit there. She lets US use it sometimes - for somebody special. - Been sacked. - So you want to leave? - I've lost my job. - So you want to leave? - My daddy had to leave because he stabbed Mr. Lynch. Is that true? - He was drunk, Joey. He didn't know - what he was doing. - Well, that's it now, so he's - never gonna come home again. - Joey! - What are they doing? - They're kissing! - You are breaking the law of god and man by watching - that rancid abomination! - I never knew - it could be like this. - Shut it down now! - Nobody ever kissed me the way you do. - The world outside our holy and beleaguered island is going to hell! - And now you can see why. - Not even one? - Elizabeth Taylor! - Turn it off! - We must keep storming heaven to combat the evil American filth lapping like a mad dog at sacred shores. - It's Deborah kerr, not Elizabeth Taylor! - Shut it down! - Joey? - Joey? Joey? - Yes, father? He didn't even bother to come home and see me when he came home last time. He just got into fights and said, "fuck it," - and walked away to england. - You're upset now, but you shouldn't use that sort of language. - He used to work here once. - I know he did. And he used to make things - that no one else could make. - No, he couldn't. Mr. Dillon had to sack him because of his drinking. Even Frankie says that, - and it's true. - Shall we go home now? - What did you hear when god asked you to be a priest? - Well... God never asked me to be a priest, Joey. - You were lying? You weren't called? - I was called, all right, but not by god. - Well, I'm not lying. I've heard the voice - of the holy ghost. - Joey. - I'm going to be a priest. And I'm going to stop people doing bad things. Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem. - Joey, listen to me. That is not the right thing - for you to do now. - It is. And it would be a sin - for anyone to stop me. - No, Joey. - Joey? Joey. Thank you for finding him, father. Come on. - Don't worry, mommy, everything's gonna be all right now. - But you said Jeremiah had been called by the holy ghost. - Well, the holy ghost has changed his mind. - I think that perhaps you might have known all along that - it was you being called, Daniel. - No. I didn't. - Well, it's all settled now. I need Jeremiah to help me run the business. - I think that deep down, Daniel, you always knew it. I can almost see the holy spirit shining from your face. I'm sure you can feel it. You will be so special. There is no greater love than that of a people for their priest. And you'll make me the happiest mother in Ireland. - Thurles has a very busy little cinema. Average take there is about Â£150 a week. Roscrea, the classic. Â£200. - And the ormond in nenagh? - Oh, they do best of all. - Average weekly take there is over Â£300. - What? - Sometimes more, depending on the film. - Will that be all, your grace? - No. Get me father Barry down here now. I have a cousin who has a diocese in america. Long beach. I was out there to visit him in the summer. Aren't supermarkets extraordinary in the states, father? - Oh, now, Rome shrinks when you walk into a supermarket in California. Maybe a stained glass window here, to catch the morning light. Not much ornamentation. It should be imposing, yet functional. Modest in a majestic sort of way. - More le corbusier than Michelangelo then. - You what? Nothing, just... I think I know exactly what you want, your grace. Yes. Yes. I suppose you're wondering why I asked you to come here. You may remember a while back, talking to me about illumination, tools to civilize your pagan flock. - Oh, well, I don't... - I think I get your logic now. Maybe we're closer to them buckos in Hollywood than we care to admit. Your picture house might be just the thing in the current climate. We need to keep one step ahead - of them all the time. - Ahead of who? - The world, father Barry, the world. The dark forces of secularism. This will be the gable. Chancel there. Nave here. High altar there. And father Barry's little picture house will pay for all of this. - Are you nearly there, Willie? - Yep, I've just finished here. I'll be finished here in a. - Minute and I'll get it then. - Hello, Molly. - How's Joseph? - He'll be grand. Thanks. - About him wanting to become a priest. - I just want him to be happy. - He's far too young to know, Molly. - I'm not going to fight with him. - I never knew what to say to my parents when they came to visit me in the seminary. I just wanted them to take me home. They sat there and talked about the changing of the seasons. By my second year, we were already lost to each other. I never should have come back here. - You wanted to come home? - I did. - I'm not sorry it happened. It gets so dark and lonely here in the winter. I shouldn't be saying any of this to you. - No, maybe you shouldn't. - I know you wouldn't - understand, but it was love. - How do you know I wouldn't understand? - I'm talking about real love that two people can feel on this earth. I don't... - I don't mean god's love. - Neither do I. - It's what's missing in this place. It's what's missing in this whole bloody country. - In the evening of life, we will be judged by love... And by love alone. - Who said that? - A lonely old Saint. A recommendation. A good one. - I wasn't expecting that. Why? - You know very well it's impossible to get a job - without it. - That's true. Maybe I wasn't cut out for the teaching. There's a local election coming up down my way. I thought I might throw me hat in the ring. - You think a politician's life will suit you? - Won't know till I try. You should go to Rome next winter or somewhere where there's light. I would, if I was you. Good-bye, Daniel. - God bless. - Bishops don't bless picture houses. Did you ever hear of one doing it? - He's a bishop. He can bless anything he feels like blessing. - Well, if the bishop's there, - you have to be there. - I know. One day, they'll see their folly. - Will it be a cowboy film? - Shut up! - Bless this building and all those who use it. And Grant that the activities that take place here will build up a spirit of order amongst the community and lead to the well-being of all our citizens. In the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost. Amen. Amen. - Well done, father. - Father Barry! - Well done, father. - Oh, what is it? - Aren't you gonna go - round Columbus circle? - What for? - Oh, to see it. - It? - That's what - this whole date's about. - What? - What I've got that you want. - I give up. - It's Gladys glover. - No kidding? - Hello. Joseph, welcome. - Thanks, father. - Sorry we're late, father. - That's all right. - Everything all right? Sure. Just stepped out for a bit. So are you winning them over out there along the dark and rural byways? - I think so. Slowly but surely. - Mom, it's started. - It's a hard old slog. It'll happen, Eileen. It's hard to argue against the - brilliance of a 60-watt bulb. - That's true. - Come on. - Okay, Joey. - Are you going back in? - I think I remember how this one ends. I'll see you later.
