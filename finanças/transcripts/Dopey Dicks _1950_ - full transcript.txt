[♪] What a day, moving that guy all the way from the 13th floor. Boy, am I exhausted. Hope you didn't strain yourself carrying that duster. No, I can take it. All right, put that lamp in the corner. It ought to go against that wall. The corner. The wall. The corner. The wall. The corner. That's better. Get busy, now, and don't drop anything. A mustache. What an improvement. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Oh, paint. What have you got in the hand? Nothing. [SPITS] SHEMP: A-choo! [CRASHING] [CHUCKLES] Sneezed. Hey, Larry. [SNORING] It's 5:00. I'm up, I'm up. Gee, it must be great to be a private eye. You're rough and you're tough, you got to be ready for anything. You always have a stubby little gun in the top drawer, just in case of trouble. This guy's expecting a lot of trouble. But what a life. You could be relaxing, just like this when a beautiful dame rushes in, desperate, not knowing where to turn. [PANTING] Oh, I'm in dreadful trouble. I'm desperate. I don't know where to turn. I'm sorry, lady, but I-- No, no, I won't take no for an answer. Strange men are following me. They'd be strange if they didn't. Heh-heh-heh. Don't you understand? My life's in danger. Why, I can't make a move without-- [SCREAMS] What happened to him? Where'd he go? Spread out. [MUFFLED SCREAMING] What'd you find? Not a thing. Come on. We couldn't find him, lady. Now she disappeared. [GRUNTS] When you make a right turn, put your arm out. [GRUNTS] Hey, fellas. She left her bracelets. And a note. "Please help me. Take my jewels. They're all I have. "Come to 275 Mortuary Road quickly, or it will be too late." We got to help her. But we'll give her back her bracelets. This is my chance to be a private eye. That poor kid is in trouble. Well, how are you going to handle the case? Easy. I'll use my wits. Now she's really in trouble. Oh, yeah? I ought to let you have it. Well... You can have it. Thanks. [GRUNTS] Look what you did. I'm not finished. [YELPS] Come on, get going. I will, I will. Come on. [CAR APPROACHES] [THUNDER CLAPS] About your young assistant, professor, I'm afraid she-- Not now, Ralph, this is more important. We're on the verge of a critical test. If this succeeds, we'll make thousands of them, an army of mechanical men. [MACHINERY CLANGS] Look out! Oh, I've failed again. And that's the third head he's ruined. With a bit more research-- No, Ralph, it's the same old story, he simply can't see where he's going. I know. What he needs is a human head, with a brain. I propose to get one. Come with me, Ralph. I want to show you something. There. This will do the job neatly and cleanly. Look. [BUZZES] See? Heh-heh! That's all there is to it. Now, if I only had a human...head. No, no. Ralph, your brain for science. No, no. But I haven't got any brains. You've told me so yourself, remember? [THUNDER CLAPS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Ah. Visitors. That's funny, no answer. Well, nobody's home, let's go. Wait a minute. You wanted to be a private eye, now you got to go through with it. Ah, three of them. There's the answer to your problem. Perhaps you're right, Ralph. Show them in, show them in. That girl's in trouble, and we got to get to the bottom of it. [BONKS] [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] Wait a minute. Come in, gentlemen, come in. [THUNDER CLAPS] Pray, make yourselves at home. Your hats. No, we'll hold on to them. Where's the young lady that lives here? Young lady? About 5'2" with golden hair? ALL: Yes. Blue eyes...? ALL: Yes, yes. Long curling lashes? ALL: Yes, yes, yes. Haven't seen her. We know the girl's here. Come clean, or we'll-- Suppose, uh, you step in and see the master? Perhaps he can help you. Okay. Just a moment, gentlemen, one at a time. The professor doesn't like crowds. Ah, nice, high forehead. You-- Just a minute. I'm the brains of this outfit. Brains? Come with me. [CHUCKLES] Don't go away, gentlemen. We may need all of you. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGH] I don't like the looks of that guy. Neither do I. You keep your eye on him, I'll go look for the girl. [THUNDER CLAPS] This is the best of the lot, professor, which isn't saying very much. Thank you, thank you. I say, that will be all, Ralph. Yeah, that'll be all, Ralph. Queer sort of a duck. [LAUGHING MANICALLY] Yes. You're all right. Hey, what's this all about? There's a young lady here-- In due time, my dear sir. In due time. First, I want you to look down that hole, where you'll be surprised. What have I got to lose? It's sort of a garbage disposal, I didn't see anything. Well, uh, take a good, long look. [SCREAMING] Every man for himself. Oh! [RINGS] [CRANKS] [GRUNTS] [MUFFLED] Oh, help me. What, you got a toothache? Help me out of here. What'd you say? Wait till I take this off. Oh. Thank goodness you got here. You're not a minute too soon. Well, untie me. Oh, okay. [YELPS] Take it easy. Easy, now. [SCREAMING] [BOING] [SCREAMS] [CHOKING] Beat it, bub, a guy can get his head cut off around here. You'll find it in the bucket. [YELPS] Oh, thanks. Those men are fiends, look. "Two men escape State Hospital, all-points alarm goes out." Well, you can stop worrying, sister. Nothing is going to happen while I'm around. [SCREAMS] [GASPING] I don't seen nothing-- Gone again. What makes her so restless? Ha-ha-ha. [CLANG] Got him. Moe. Is your head okay? Yeah, pretty good. What did you hit me with? This. Oh. Pewter. Yeah, it's antique-- [GRUNTS] I found the girl, all right, but she disappeared. That's it, disappear. That's what we got to do. Come on. [YELPS] Moe, Moe, what is that? I don't know. [THUNDER CLAPS] [SCREAMS] [YELPS] [SPRINGS CLANG] Larry, help! Don't worry, kid, I'll have you out in a minute. [GROANING] Larry, what are you waiting for? Give me a hand, will you? Give me a hand. Oh, I was suffocating under there. Goodness. Thanks, Larry, I nearly-- Oh, no, no, Larry! Oh, Moe! Oh! Larry! Larry! [YELPING] [PHONE RINGING] Poor Larry. [RINGS] Operator. Operator. Get me the State Hospital, quick. OPERATOR: Consult your directory. Listen, operator, I ain't got no directory. Look behind you, please. [MUTTERS] Central section, north-eastern section, Western section. If I don't hurry, we'll all be in sections. Maybe it's in here. [THUNDER CLAPS] [GRUNTS] State Hospital, here we are. Main, 2-4-6-8. Main, 2-4-6-8. Main, 2-4-6-8... [RINGS] Operator, I want Main... Main? Hm. How do you like that? Ah, Main, 2-4-6-8. Now we'll have action. [RINGS] I got it, operator. It's Main 2-- Larry, is that you? [SCREAMS] MOE: Psst. Hey, Shemp. [YELPS] They got him, and he's still talking. [CHITTERING] What's the matter with him? I'm still in one piece. Oh, yeah? [YELPS] [BONES CRACK] [SCREAMING] Don't go away. [WHIMPERS] [MUTTERING, SCREAMS] How do you like that? What's the matter with that egghead? Nervous, I guess. Yeah. I say, would you mind opening this? Why, certainly. That's a high hat. Ha-ha-ha. [SCREAMS] Hey, that was Moe. [GROANING] [YELPING] Hey, Moe, I didn't know it was you. Oh, for a look at a friendly face. [SCREAMS] Hey, Moe. We found a secret passage. I'm right with you. Wait a minute. Where's Shemp? He got away. I got the professor locked in the closet. See? [SWALLOWS] Try and get out of this one. [YELPS] Wait for me! Moe! Hey, here comes the car. Hey, wait. Stop. Hey. He stopped. Come on. Hey, wait for me. Thanks, mister. You saved our lives. LARRY: Let's go. MOE: Oh, boy. Safe at last. Argh! Look! [ALL WHIMPER] SHEMP: Easy. [ALL SCREAMING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [♪]
