It was around this time last night, 11 p.m., here on Long Island. Guess you could say I had a UFO sighting. I mean, I don't know what the hell it was, but I'm guessing it was several miles out, just hovering in the sky, this orange glowing light, and before I can pull over, it darts across the sky, and it's gone. No way it was a man-made craft or drone or whatever. There wasn't even any sound. I don't know, I've never seen anything like it before. Aaah, just an airplane. Well, at least the moon's out. 1 a.m., still no sign of anything. Really wishing I had some proof, but yeah I think it's time to head home, and I guess I'll just post this online, see what people say. This is where I was. Bendigo Road, if that's how you pronounce it, about an hour from my apartment in Riverhead. Let's see, believe I was right about here when I saw the UFO off to the northwest, and, I checked the news, nothing about strange lights in the sky, but I did find there's been quite a history of sightings on Long Island. All right, each one of these symbols represents a sighting, and these are just the most recent ones. You can see they're all over the place. Looks like we got one in Riverhead. Okay, May 16th, 2016, circular green object entering our atmosphere turned into light storm of energy. Looks like there's one out here. Let's see what that, okay, says East, East Hampton but looks like Montauk. February 14th, 2016, bright orange light shines down into my bathroom window then disappears. Hmm. Should see about getting my sighting on here. Found this video on some UFO channel and this sighting looks almost exactly like what I saw, but anyway. Same shape and everything, pretty much, although mine was more orange and, of course, it was further away. It's not every day you see something like this, that's for sure. It's been five days since the sighting. Just gonna keep posting these videos. At least I'm getting some feedback from others who believe, which is encouraging, 'cause I don't think my family and friends really believe me, at least not the ones I've told. I guess it sounds crazy, but still, I know what I saw. No way it was military, or some kind of natural phenomena. I mean, there's got to be other intelligent life-forms out there, if not in our solar system, then some other system, especially when there's billions of galaxies, or maybe these visitors are from a parallel universe or alternate dimension and then, what the hell are they doing here? One can only imagine. So I decided to make my sighting official, got this form all filled out, ready to go. UFO Reporting Headquarters. Actually there's quite a number of websites and organizations that do these, but anyway, didn't mark any of these off 'cause none of this happened. Were there any electrical or magnetic effects such as the car engine stopping? No. Close encounters? No. Was missing time experienced? No. Let's see, this chart was useful. Didn't realize there was so many different shapes. Some of these are really weird. Anyway, witness contact information? Yes, I give permission to release my name. I mean I'm already public about this so... Submitting image and video. Of course I don't have anything, although they say you can submit a drawing, but this will do. Here we go. Here at work, lunch break actually, and, really wishing I could just take the rest of the day off, but anyway, this guy messaged me from online, says he used to live in Long Island and that all the sightings are linked to some secret project in Montauk, but yeah he's agreed to do a video call tonight, although he doesn't wanna reveal his identity, so I'm not really sure how that's gonna work, but I don't know, we'll see what he has to say and hopefully he's serious. Hey, thanks for doing this call. I'm recording this just so you know. Yeah, no problem, man. People got to hear the truth. Nice costume. Costume? Ha, ha, whatever works, man. So what's the deal in Montauk? I got the link you sent about the Camp Hero Air Force base, but it looks like it's just a park. Well, that's what they want you to think. I'm surprised you didn't know about it. I've only been here a year. I'm from Connecticut actually. All right, well here's the deal. The park is just a cover. What it really is is an underground base with, I believe, 12 subterranean levels and a series of interconnected tunnels. You all right? My father told me that's where the experiments took place. We're talking psychic warfare, mind control, even time travel. Time travel, really? That's... Well yeah. It's not as far fetched as you think. Anyway, they'd mostly take young men, I mean they'd fucking steal the homeless right off the streets, transients, runaways. Less than 1% of them would even survive the experiments. I mean, were talking at least 10,000 people and that's just between '71 and '83, when the project was at its peak, and I still believe it's going on now. The Montauk project? That's right. Well how could they could they be getting away with this, all those people, that's insane. The government's gotten away with worse before. And what about the UFO connection then? Well don't you get it? They're using alien technology. Alien technology, yep, that's... Yeah, the ETs are part of the project. Well, that's why there's so many sightings in that area. You see, we're talking about our own shadow government here, colluding with Nazi SS scientists. So Nazis are... Uh, yeah. I mean after the second World War, through Operation Paperclip they brought these scientists over and they took their knowledge, some of which they used in the Montauk Project years later. And your father was a project member? No, no. He was only stationed there. God rest his soul. What about some kind of evidence, documents or something to prove the Montauk Project was real? Oh, it's real, trust me. But I doubt there's ever gonna be any kind of paper trail. Look, all I know is what my father told me and what others have made public. But I've only scratched the surface. The rabbit hole goes much deeper than you could possibly imagine, but you're gonna need to do the digging on your own. Oh, I plan on it, believe me. I need to cut this short, my health ain't what it used to be. All right. Well, keep in touch and thanks for doing this and everything and letting me record. Hey, be careful. Been reading through this website which that guy recommended. Lots of info about the experiments that supposedly went on, some background about the project. Definitely disturbing, to say the least. And Montauk of all places. This is like Nevada's Area 51, only more sinister. I don't know. Camp Hero State Park. This at the eastern tip of Long Island, 754 acres. And this is the military area, built in 1942. And here's the old radar. Supposedly they were using this thing as massive transmitter, which was key to the experiments. That's if the stories are true. It's about midnight, just had this awful nightmare. I was at Camp Hero, standing before that radar. There was a thunderstorm, it's night, and I can see something standing at the top of that radar tower, just staring down at me, like a dark shape or silhouette. I can't really make out any of its features, even in the flashes of lightning, but I can tell it's humanoid, although its head seems too large for its body, which is almost skeletal, and it keeps staring. All I wanna do is run, but I can't. Then suddenly this tidal wave comes rising behind the tower out of nowhere and crashes down. I'm underwater, I can't breathe. Then I woke up. Seemed so real. I don't know. Maybe I'm getting too obsessed with this stuff. Been looking through my videos, and I just wanna thank everyone that's been commenting and everything. It's good to know there's open minds out there, especially when people I'm close to still aren't taking me seriously, and now they know about my sighting at work. Some joker left this on my desk, but anyway, I think this weekend I'm gonna head out to Camp Hero, go for a cruise. Get out of town, maybe stay the whole weekend, if there's any hotels open. I don't know what else I can do at this point. So I'll leave it at that. Been driving about 80 minutes now from Riverhead, Camp Hero should be coming up. Plan is, get a bunch of footage, scope things out. Let's see, I'm right about here. These shaded areas are restricted access, off limits. Have to see how close I can get. You know, if the electromagnetic radiation emitted from a cell phone can alter our brain wave activity like some studies have shown, imagine what the EM radiation from that radar could do. I mean, if it's transmitting at the right frequencies, it could definitely alter our mood and behavior, making us susceptible to control. Sounds like science fiction, but it's actually reality. This radar was initially key to the mind control experiments, but around 1974, they began using something called the Montauk Chair which, from what I read, was based on alien technology. Anyway, they hooked this chair device to the radar system so it could harness the electromagnetic energy to amplify psychic powers, like remote viewing, telepathy, and there was one psychic who became the project's most advanced. Not only was he was able to create objects out of thin air, but he could even open gateways into space and time, when hooked into the chair, although, eventually, he helped sabotage the project. This is the back of the maintenance building. This is one of the bunkers. Oh, look at that. Ooh, we got company. Looks like we got something here. Yep. No way I'm getting down there. What the heck? Looks like this is the transmitter building. Let's see what we can see. Oh damn it, wish I could get in here. This is part of Battery 113. The Montauk Project supposedly came to an end on August 12th, 1983. As far as I know, several key project members, who were concerned the experiments were out of control, had devised a plan to crash the program. So they had this advanced psychic guy I talked about create an invisible creature from his subconscious mind when hooked into the Montauk Chair. They had hoped this would scare the project heads into ending all the experiments, but the plan backfired, and instead this thing manifested as a huge, hairy, beast that went out of control, destroying everything in its path. So they rushed to cut the power to the transmitter which finally shut everything down, including this mind-created monster. Anyway, the base was soon purged and abandoned after this disaster. At least that's how the legend goes. I've pretty much been around the whole base. Doesn't look like much is going on, but there's definitely a strange vibe. Not a good feeling. Anyway, the park closes at sunset and it's almost eight, so I'm gonna head out. Let's see, I'm at some motel here in Montauk. Luckily they had a room. Anyway, the plan is head out again tomorrow, get a closer look around, probably check out this back trail, which leads to Battery 112 and down by the old Montauk highway. Definitely gonna need some cover if I sneak in after dark. I'm about a mile down from Camp Hero. Gonna leave my car here and head to the back trail. That'll probably be my best way in, given there's a white SUV with dark windows just sitting by the park entrance, so this place is definitely patrolled. I mean, the goal is not to get arrested here. Haven't done this kind of shit since I was a kid. Definitely feeling a rush. Let's see, tick repellent, extra batteries, bolt cutters, bunch of stuff. Should be ready to go. Kind of wishing I brought my cell phone, but too risky when it could be used to track my location. Not taking any chances. Okay. Looks like one of those SUVs. Shit. I believe I've gone a mile now, so I don't know where the trail is, unless I missed it. I don't know, maybe I should turn back, but still I got a feeling about this place. Here we go, finally. This has got to be Boulder Field, which means I'm getting close, according to the map. Yep, almost there. Not too far. 11 p.m. Just felt this strange vibration, almost like a tremor coming from the ground. I'd say it lasted maybe 10 seconds. Gotta be from an underground facility. I don't know what else could it be. Coast looks clear. Not sure how close I'm gonna get, given the area by the radar is under video surveillance, although I didn't see any cameras yesterday so... Archer 6, this is Archer X-ray. Indicate a perimeter breach, in sector alpha-seven. Shit. Roger, X-ray. Probably just some more deer. We'll check it out. Roger 6 out. Archer 2, target in sight. Roger 2, intercept and secure tango. Archer 2 Roger. I'm gonna have to bushwhack outta here or try to connect to the old Montauk Highway. Gotta get back to my car. Either way, this isn't gonna be easy. Something is definitely affecting my compass. I don't believe this. My God. Jesus Christ Gotta get this footage online, no matter what. This shit is real. All those people, murdered. It's got to be stopped, whatever it takes. There's no going back now. Should hit the old Montauk Highway. Gonna be sick. Must've been exposed to something. God only knows what they're doing out here. Oh man. I don't look so good. Not stopping. I don't know what the hell that was. Definitely felt like something was watching me, something unnatural. I mean, this place is like, like one big Twilight Zone. Like all reality's been warped or turned on its head. Come on. Oh, thank God. Oh God. I'm almost there, almost there. No, no, no, not my car. Goddamnit. I should've listened to that guy. Shadow government, alien world order. Oh my God, I can see it. There it is.
