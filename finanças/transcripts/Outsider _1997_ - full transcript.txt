Platoon... get up! Starring Atten...tion! Comrade Warrant Officer, the 1st platoon of 1st Company is ready for inspection! Comrades soldiers, salute! - Salute! Salute the flag! Atten...tion! Take your seats. Quiet! Quiet now! So we're together again, boys and girls. I can see you haven't changed a lot, most of you look the same. You also have two new classmates. Let them introduce themselves. Come on, Kadunc. Kadunc, will you please stand up? in the film of Andrej Ko?ak You all know Borut Kadunc very well, so my advice is to avoid him. Kadunc, you'll get a lot of chances to prove yourself. We also have a new classmate from the friendly republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let him introduce himself. Sead Mulahasanovi?. OUTSIDER Quiet! Be quiet! Sead, come over here... Sit in the front row. Just call me Bomb, okay? Ljubljana, autumn of 1979 Come on, Sead. Why do you fuck around like that? - How do you kick that ball? - Bomb! Metka, give us the ball. What are you waiting for? Here you are! On your feet, soldier! On your feet, son. Come on! You're getting your chance today. Come on, Sejo. How come you're lying down? Radovanovi? is waiting. You'll be playing left back, and he'll play right wing. Sejo my boy, make him look bad... Please! Come on. When I was your age... You were building the Br?ko - Banovi? railway. Not only that. Let's go, son. What is it? Where are you going? - Outside. Son... Hey, pal! Wait! Are you still pissed off? Sead, wait. Hey, Bosnian! Who cares if it was a foul? Football is only fun, anyway. What would you know about football? Don't be so serious. Come and listen to something cool. Stop for a minute. This is my new friend Sead. From Bosnia. We're in the same class. I'm Rat. Sead. And that animal there is Easy. Sead, sit down, stay cool, and listen. Fuck you, fuck you! What's with these names? Punk names, man. Eins, zwei, drei, vier... - Wait, I fucked up. - Screw you! A string broke. Come on. A louse is a wingless insect... who lives of human and animal blood. Two types are known: Ovum, that's a nit... and a grown-up insect. This is... a nit. A nit is classified as being among those species who attack all social classes. Check the Bosnian's hair. He has them for sure. Quiet! Who said that? A nit - pediculus humanus... ...can spread very quickly... Metka is hot, eh? But cold. She's up herself though. She'd never let you screw her. It multiplies with nits who stick to human hair. No one should think that a highly developed society... ...is immune from the harm that this creature causes. Dude, I'm gonna repeat this school year. Metka! What is it, Sead? It's Friday. And? What's on Friday? You go out to discos, cafes, movies... - What would you know? - I just know. I used to go out in Belgrade, Zagreb, Skopje... Where do I come into it? Maybe we could go out together. Metka! Metka! Why are you like this? Like what? Pretty. Come off it, Bosnian! - That was a nice piece of arse, kid. - Congratulations. Fucking hicks! Hey pal, four beers over here. Like I told you... Sead is the only normal guy in that fucked-up school. Okay, but we gotta give him a name. Why are you such a drag? He's got a name. What sort of name is 'Sead'? So give him yours... Mirko. Don't be fucking stupid! Shut the fuck up. I'll come up with something. Sid, yes! - Yes! Sid, great! Cool! Sid! - Sid, who? - Sid Vicious! He doesn't have a clue! A legend, man. I'll bring you the tape tomorrow. You'll cream your jeans. What are you talking about? To Sid, guys! To Sid! - To Sid! - Cheers! Cheers! - Cheers! - Sid! Give us two. There's only four of us. Okay! Come on. Hi, I'll have two. Me too. I got some brand new stuff here. Anyone wanna try? I will. Look at this. Where'd you get that? Dump it! Heart tablets. You'll be in hospital. Sorry, my mistake. - How much for you? - What is it? Don't ask, just swallow. It'll blow you away! - Easy, go bring us five beers. - Okay. You scared, or what? I'm not scared... but they're for women. Women take pills. Men take beer. Fuck it, it's more for us then. - Give me two more. - Later. Man, get a load of this. That's Sid, pal. Is this a time to come home? Know what time it is? Where have you been all night? Are you listening to me? Stand still! Where have you been? Answer me! With my friends. Really? With friends? Do your friends dress like that? Answer, you bum! Yes. What? Yes! Are you joking with me? Haris, please. You go to bed. Marija, no one goes to bed till this is settled. Clear? - Where have you been till now? - I've been at the disco. What disco? Damn discos! Hear me? Answer! Marija, let me go! Look how he is! Now you'll see, you bum! You fucking... good-for-nothing! Sead, why do you provoke him? You know what he's like. Where'd you get the shades? Show me! I won't steal them. Stop talking Kadunc, or you'll be repeating the year again! And you be serious, Mulahasanovi?. We take school seriously here. The sun is so strong today! I need sunglasses. Quiet! Who said that? Workbooks on the table. We'll have a test, thanks to your friend. No, no. - Yes, yes. A, B, A, B... You'll have a test. End of discussion! Hafner, have you finished already? Not yet. The Danube Waltz is the most beautiful and elegant of all dances. And I can't imagine your prom without it. That is why we are about to learn some beginners' steps today. We need a handsome couple. A nice guy for a start... Someone like to try? Any volunteers? Do you want to try maybe? Me? Come on, it won't hurt you. - Why me? - Come on, come on. You'll be fine. Do like this. Hold your partner tight. Let her feel safe in your arms. Okay. We start with a gentle swing. Music, please. 1, 2, 3... 2, 2, 3... Good! Great! It wasn't so hard, was it? So, who are you? What's your name? Sead Mulahasanovi?. Sead! Such a beautiful name! My first boyfriend's name was Sead. He used to dance, and dance... Just like you'll soon be dancing! Which of you young ladies will dance with Sead? Maybe Metka would like to try? I will. Great! Let's have other couples join in. Sead, sorry about that. I didn't mean to insult you. No matter... I'm used to much worse than that. I was in a bad mood that time. That jerk gave me a B in geography. And I knew everything. Metka, B is great. Maybe for someone else. What's that under your eye? I fell off a bike. Metka? Yes? Wanna go see a movie with me on Friday? Alright. Alright. What'll we see? A film. A film, I know. But... Everything has to be changed Take drugs and kill everyone Everything should be burned Walk out and sleep peacefully I can't be fucked by the Party I can't be fucked by the army Mods, whores and hippies It all stinks Anarchy all over Slovenia Anarchy, Sead is feeling great today Anarchy all over Slovenia Anarchy, Sead is feeling great today Proletarians already have their own houses** No one dares to be with us And when so much has already happened to us But we are heroes, but we are heroes** I can't be fucked by the Party I can't be fucked by the army Mods, whores and hippies It all stinks Anarchy all over Slovenia Anarchy, Sead is feeling great today What's up, Bosnian? Don't you people have a bathroom at home? I bet they never heard of them. What kind of haircut is that? Bosnian, do you hear what I'm saying? Look, he doesn't understand shit. Those monkeys can't talk! We'll cut your hair short... for free. Pero, bring the scissors. Let me go! Let me go! What? Fuck off! What is it, boys? What's up, Horvat? Looking for trouble? You fucking arsehole! We were only joking, Kadunc! You don't fuck around with my friend. You understand? Okay. Okay, Borut. It's alright. Fucking mods. The human body is made up of skin... ....subcutaneous tissue, ...muscles and the skeleton which the body is built on. We know two types of muscles. Smooth and striated. The cardiac muscle is a special type of a striated muscle and it acts reflexively. Be seated. Attention please. Comrade principal wants to tell you something important. Students... Certain information has been delivered to our school ...and I, as principal, feel a responsibility to share it with you. Our president, Marshal Tito, was brought here to Ljubljana this morning. To the clinical center, to be more precise. You are old enough to understand the seriousness of the situation. We may expect a whole spectrum of provocations... ...because the enemy never sleeps, whether an external or internal one. That is why, if a stranger addresses you, even a foreign one... If he asks about the state at your home, or what your parents think... Kadunc and the new boy, out! Wait for me outside my office. It is your duty as citizens and students... ...to report every such example of provocation to the police, ...to your class teacher, or myself. I am expecting of you that during these difficult times... ...you prove yourself as students... ...worthy of Tito's name. Now we're fucked. - Why? - Why? The principal is nuts about the Party. It won't go down so good. - Same as my dad. - Your dad's in the Party, too? - An army officer. - Officer? They're crazy about Marshal Tito anyway. They'd still play "partisans and Germans" in the woods. But they won't get me. I'm not going to the army. What do you mean? I won't do military service. I'll pretend I'm a fruitcake, or run away abroad. What are you gonna do abroad? I'll push dope or go to the oil rigs to drill the holes. A foreigner is a foreigner, my friend. What would you know about foreign countries? I know. Even this is a foreign country to me. Are we gonna have some action tonight? Do some graffiti, eh? I'm going out with Metka. We're going to the movies. Someone's in love here! Metka, your flower. Come on, or we'll be fucked for this, too. Oh, the comedians are here. Do you understand the seriousness of the situation we've found ourselves in? No...! Because if you knew, you wouldn't be acting like that. Not so, Kadunc? Do you want to repeat this grade for the third time? You know very well there's no third repeating. Don't you? I can't hear your answer, Kadunc. I understand, comrade Principal. Fiddlesticks, you understand! And then your mother will come again to beg me to take you back. And you know what I'll tell her? I'll tell her you're nothing but a bum. And you, Sead Mulahasanovi?... You've made a fine start! I have your grades here. They are not bad. But if you continue to consort with this bum Kadunc... ...you'll end up just like him. Is that clear? Yes, comrade Principal. So... You both get a principal's reprimand. Any further offence will get you automatically expelled. Is that clear? Comrade Principal... Yes? Anything but a reprimand! So what will I do with you? I don't know. Dad will kill me. Mulahasanovi?... Remember... There must be a penalty. I believe you're going to improve. Then we shall talk differently. Is that right, my corporal? So, you're attacking my queen? Okay, if that's the way you want it... Here... check! Well, comrade Warrant Officer... What if I move my pawn here? Then what? Then you won't get out of it so easily... ...my amateur. Look at him. Warrant Officer Mulahasanovi?. Yes, I'm on duty. What is it? Graffiti? What graffiti? Is that a joke? Who? Where? Who's that? Hullo! Hullo! Listen, call Rajkovi? and ?alja. It's either someone joking with us, or we have a visit. We'll finish this later. Call them! Stop! Stay there! What is this? What does it say? Are you crazy? Do you know that in 1943 one would get shot for this instantly, you bum? Stupid kid! Corporal! Take him to the office. He needs a rest from drawing. I'll check out the guards. Come on! Graffiti, eh? Fucking graffiti! Fuck you! Say, what does it mean - an A inside an O? What's your name? I'll fucking show you, motherfucker! Give him to me. What's your name then? So... Sead... Thanks for seeing me home. You don't have to take me any further. I live just around the corner. I really have to go now. It's late. Metka. I'd... I'd just like to... ...hug you. I must go, it's really late. Sleep tight! I shall. Sead, have some more. Mum, I really can't. I'll have another plateful, if it kills me. I had a busy night, last night. These beans! Tell me Sejo... What's the writing on the walls all about, nowadays? I don't get any of it. I don't understand what it means. - What? - That... Imagine this: last night some bozo jumped over our fence and started writing some nonsense in the middle of the barracks. In English, too. I don't know... ...what made him do that... ...but he sure won't do it again. Marija... your beans are... If I'd lived another 100 years, I'd never have found out about a band called... Sexual Pistols. What is, Sejo? Do you listen to those Pistols yourself? I've heard about them. What happened last night? Nothing. We'll interrogate him a bit... and hand him over to cops tomorrow. Marija, please gimme some bread. His father is a big-time hoodlum as well. Kadunc. That fucking... What's his name? Who, senior's or junior's? Junior's. Borut. - Dad, do you know what you've done? - What? That's my... Wait! Come back! Stop! What is he to you? Nothing. We're in the same class. You're in the same class, huh? What do they teach you there? How to write on walls? Listen Sejo. If I find out that you're into that shit yourself... ...you'll answer to me. Is that clear? - Yes. Wait. Haris, let him go. What's bugging you now? Don't dare talk to me like that! Take your plate to the kitchen, and wash up. Then you can go. Dismissed! How come something like that happens? And why wasn't I informed? I'm here to help you. I listen to all your suggestions. Sead, you're the one who's disappointed me the most. How come you didn't notice what was happening with Kadunc!? As a collective, we should be preventing this from happening. Dear comrades and students. Because of a state of emergency that occurred... ...due to the intolerable behaviour of Borut Kadunc... a student of the 4F class... ...following the decision of the school's and Youth organization's boards... ...we are compelled to take the following measures: A) Borut Kadunc, son of Armin Kadunc, is to be stripped of the right to an education... and membership of the Youth organization. B) The 4F class is punished by a reprimand... ...and its performance for the School Day will be cancelled. C) Wearing of badges, torn pants and signs on the jackets will be forbidden... ...as well as any other ornament not worthy of our school's image. Long live The League of Communists of Yugoslavia headed by Comrade Tito! We are punished deservedly, but the class must not waver from its path. We have to work. Learn, learn and learn again. Let's prove that 4F didn't stumble at the first barrier. Zba?nik and others, you heard about the badges. Sead, believe me, nothing more could've been done. My dad tried everything. Don't be like that, you must think about yourself a bit. A month will pass quickly. He'll get out of jail, you'll do a record... all will be like before. Metka, open those beautiful eyes of yours! What do you see, huh? A month? One must wait for at least... Don't play the smartarse! You wanna go to jail yourself? You know what? Call me when you come to your senses. Metka! Corporal... Happy New Year. Be it a good or a bad one. - Cheers, comrade Warrant Officer. - Cheers. Sit down. Stand up. To your family, corporal. Cheers. What is it? - You're not used to home-made schnapps, huh? - There's fire-water and there's fire-water! Fire-water? We've the bottle to finish. It's a strong one, that's for sure. I've got this from Janez. He's from your department. His dad makes it. - Then we should have another one. - That we should! Now to your health, comrade Warrant Officer. I'll drink to that! And to your family. - What do you know about my family? - Nothing, I was just... Such a family be buggered! My wife is crying... and our kid... ...has joined the imbecile brigade. We were all the same at that age. It's not like that, Kvrgi?. He hangs around with those... those graffiti... Punks? Yes. I don't like it. I don't like it at all! They paint their hair, wear neck chains. They look like idiots. Lot of nonsense. Maybe it's some new party, eh? comrade Warrant Officer... It's not about that, Kvrgi?. I... I wanted my son to become somebody. Like, a pilot... ...who flies high above the clouds. With a red star on the tail of his plane. I don't like it, Kvrgi?. I'm gonna fix it. I'll shoot them all like Krauts, if I have to. - Don't... - Stay where you are! Comrade Warrant Officer... Shut up! Look at this. Happy New Year! Hey, Rat. You got a smoke? There he is! - Hey, kid! - Hey! How are you, my old pal? Gimme a drink. Got something strong? - Standard or double? - Gimme double. They fucked you good and proper, eh? That's for sure. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Fucked up, man... Seriously fucked up. What happened? The cops are cool, believe it or not. But those army guys... In the barracks? First, I had to sing "Hey, brigades" for two hours. What are you laughing at, you moron? And then? Then some bald officer came... went berserk. He raved at me about punk, people I know, things I do... He had two thugs standing next to him. One of them beat me up from breakfast to lunch, and the other one from lunch to breakfast. Where are you going, Sid? To make a phone call. Sead speaking. Sorry for not calling you earlier. Yes, I know... They let Bomb out. They let him out for New Year's Eve. Eight months conditional. What are you doing now? Making a French salad? Metka, let's meet somewhere. Why? Who's coming? Come on, Metka. I'll wait for you by the street-light. So what do I do now? Nothing. How can you say that so easily? Okay... give my regards to your father and guests. See you tomorrow and Happy New Year. Rat... What? Do you still have any of those pills? What? You mean Tavor? Okay... But they're pretty strong. Don't blame me if you feel crook. Scared, huh? Hey, it's New Year. Puke once for me! I've told you how goddamn strong they are, but no one listens to me. You'd poison your own mother! My mother's a lady, I'll have you know! Sober up for shit sake! Where can we get something to drink? Lady comrade Mulahasanovi?, Happy New Year! Happy New... Happy to you, too! Where have you been? Don't ask, I froze myself. The car froze, too. We were pushing it all the way to Kolinska. - What about you? - I'm watching TV. - How is Nor?i? doing? - It's not his turn yet. I have something for you. What did you bring? We won't ever watch black and white in this house again. Understand? Look. A filter, Marija. A filter. Is it any better? Of course it is. - What is it? - A filter. We're going to visit your parents. Five days. Five days. How? - Five days, I couldn't get more. It was deducted off my summer vacation. It's because Marshal Tito is seriously ill. Are we going? - Where's the kid? - He's asleep. Yes... Is it better? Platoon... get up! Happy New Year! Sejo my son, happy new year. Wake up, son. We're going to visit your grandparents. Come on! Dad, let me sleep. You go wherever you want. Come on, Sejo, my son! So, you won't? - You don't want to? - I don't. - Is there anything you want? - I want to sleep. You've been sleeping for the last 18 years, and you still haven't slept enough? Listen, you've been sleepin' long enough. And I guarantee you'll wake up this year. - Otherwise... - Otherwise, what? You know very well. - You'll send me to military academy? - Maybe I will. Send me if you want. Screw you! What?! - What did you say!? - You heard me. Atten-shun! Stand to attention! There's no room, put it on the back seat. Jesus-fucking-Christ! What have you done with this car? When did you change the oil? Are you listening to me? It's you who I'm talking to. Shouting isn't going to help. This is all I need! I'm not going anywhere. Woman, don't mumble. Please, don't mumble! - Wait a bit. - We're going! - Just wait! - Out of the question! I don't wanna hear a single word. Let him do what he likes, if he thinks that's best. But he won't screw with me anymore. You understand? Fucking car! There! - Why, Metka? - Why? Because. I would like to stay with you. I really would, but I can't. - We're never together. - What? We're always together. We're never together. Ever. Tell your father you're sick. What's wrong with you? I can't do this to him. He's paid and booked everything. We go away every year. I just can't. Fuck it then, Metka! Sead, don't make a mountain out of a mole-hill. The week will pass quickly, and we'll be together again. Damn, it's like trying to fuck a fence-post! Drunken pig...! Fuck! Easy, it's your turn now. There's enough for everybody. Man, you wanna screw a bit? That chick is so drunk... ...she lets anyone. Hey, hello...! Do you hear me? What's wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing! Did that chick fuck you up completely? Easy? Take it easy! You know what? Feel like jamming a bit? The three of us? Yeah. - Deal! Come on, let's do some jamming. Hey, we'll be jamming now, okay? Have you tuned up already? Yes. Let's do that song of his. I like every word of yours Even though I don't understand anything at all And I'll never be able to do it The way I can do it now It's none of your business where I live It's none of your business what I think It's neither black nor white, it's always gray I'm not dead, I'm not alive Goodbye teens Goodbye teens I will never, never be a fuckin' boy I like every word of yours Even though I don't understand anything at all And I'll never be able to do it The way I can do it now There's nothing that lives behind concrete walls Behind concrete walls there's no one I can see Goodbye teens - Stop, enough! Let's go! - Let me go, you fuckers! Kadunc, come with me. Sit down. Your father's name, surname and vocation. Haris Mulahasanovi?... the JNA Sergeant. Mother's name and vocation. Marija... Housewife. When were you born and where? June 16th, 1963... Tuzla. Sead, do you have any prior convictions? No. - 16th? - June 1963. - Tuzla? - Tuzla. No, thanks. Sead... Are you aware... ...that we have you on our files now? And that the first offence may put you in a juvenile home? Know what that means? No. The social worker sends you to a juvenile home, where you learn much worse things. You get into bad company. You start stealing. We catch you and lock you up. You get 2 years conditional, at best. When it happens again, it doesn't matter if you were involved or not. The judge convicts you because you're already on file here. And the vicious circle is closed. Now... ...think if this is worth it or not. You may go now. And what about Kadunc? - Are you aware of the situation? - No. Want me to help you? Want me to help you more? Is it about Tito or something...? Because he's in hospital... You see, Kadunc... You are well aware of the situation... And you do shit up there on the roof. Whose idea was that? I don't know. Kadunc, put your hand down. Put your hand down. You wanna go down to the gym? No, thanks. Well, Kadunc... You had a nice conditional sentence. Now you're going to sit in jail for a while. Sead. How did you get here? You're not in Kranjska Gora? Not anymore. What happened? I got sick. Where is the kid? - Call him over here. - What's the problem now? Call him. Sead? Sit down. Maths - B. Slovenian language - A. Biology - A. History - B. Single party-system and Marxism basics - B. Physics - B. - Haris, what was that for? - He knows very well. He got two reprimands. "Insulting the character and work of Comrade Tito." Are you out of your mind? For how long will you make me feel ashamed in front of people? Do you know what situation this country's in? The external enemy at the gates. The internal waiting for any chance. And you're playing smartarse here. - It's not my fault. - It's mine then, is it? Why hasn't your ex-friend Kadunc thought about this before? I don't want to hear about this anymore. You bet you won't. - I won't. - You won't! I won't. A little girl was sewing a red star A star red like blood And she sang this song A song about days of freedom. A little girl was singing a song As young partisan approached her The one who fought for golden freedom For peasant's and worker's homes. Keep sewing your red star, little girl, And then sing cheerfully We put up a bloody battle against black fascist Gestapo. Sead, I'm pregnant. What? I'm pregnant. Really? Please, let's go somewhere to talk. Please. Sead, Metka, where are you two going? Metka's not feeling well. Alright, but come on time for comrade ?nidar?i?'s speech. Thanks to our choir. Now, I'll invite our dear special guest... ...our former pupil comrade ?nidar?i?... ...a member of the Presidency of the League of Working People... ...of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. I give you comrade ?nidar?i?. Comrades, dear students... Have you told anyone else? No. That's good. You shouldn't broadcast it. We'll fix it somehow. How do you propose to do that, Sead? Don't you understand? It's my second month. It's due in November. Get that? Calm down! I can work... and you can study. We are not the first in this situation. It'll be alright, Metka. Metka... Why didn't you tell me before? I didn't know. What's up, Metka, feeling cold? You guys got a problem? No one asked you, Bosnian. Metka, why don't you let me warm you up a bit? Scram. All three of you, now. Anyone understand what he said? Long live the 1st of May... Labour Day. Long live Comrade Tito! Sid... You'll drink yourself to death! That's true. When some broad fucks your brains up... ...that's real bad, eh? She's not "some broad". You know... I reckon he'll need his stomach pumped today. - She's not a broad. - She's not. Right. She's not. Waiter! Bring two pints over here. You've had enough already, man. - Two pints here! - You've had enough. For Bomb. I haven't seen him for three months. Okay, for Bomb. It was only to be expected. They had him at gunpoint long ago. Cops! Because of his father. Oh, you don't know... I don't know. His father was the manager of... How is it called? - Export company. - Of some export company. He had to hand over a certain amount of cash to someone abroad. Then he went missing without any trace. He did a runner. Bomb was still a kid. Dad left both him and his mother. He only remembers him from photos. That's how it started. He was kicked out of every school. He should be thankful only to his mother's connections... for staying in that school. True. If only the police hadn't caught him... Hey, you hick! Shut up, hick. Who do you think you are, bozzy? Looking for trouble? Button up your coat. Stop it, Sid! - Lemme go, motherfucker! - He's just drunk. - Lemme go! - Leave him alone, he's drunk! Fuck you and Ljubi?i?! (minister of defence) Fucking Slovenian delinquents! Fuck you! Mr Hafner, what brings you here? Comrade Mulahasanovi?... I don't know where to start. I am Metka's father. Please. Thanks. Your son Sead and my daughter... We were all young once, if you understand me... Is there any problem? Yes. We decided that the best thing is to forget all this. Metka decided to have an abortion. She begged me to tell you that. I hope that this won't upset your son too much. You want some more coffee? No, thanks. Sead... Sead... What is it, Mum? Mr Hafner was here. Why didn't you tell me? What's happened to Metka? You're still young. Try to understand. All right, thank you. No. Dad, what's going on? A transfer, son. What can I do about it? We're moving. It's good you're here. Go down to the basement and help your mother pack. - Moving, how? - Like this. We're moving. The truck will come for us at 4pm tomorrow. Fuck, it won't unscrew... Don't you just stand there. And what's with all these stupid questions? Because I have some questions for you, too. Come on, pack up. Listen, you won't see me in that truck. No way I have to! You think I want to go? You think this is what I've wished for? Sejo my son, that's an order, and it must be followed. - Please, stop with this foolishness! - Foolishness!? - Right. - Isn't this foolish? We live like Gypsies. One year in every city. Do you think about anything else but your orders and how to carry them out!? Do you think about the fact that my school is here and my graduation is in 15 days? Mother only feels good here and you promised she'd stay here. Sejo, son, everything will be alright. There are schools elsewhere. People, too... The army will fix all of that up. - The army will fix it? - Right. Will army fix the fact that I have no friends? Get out! - Get out! I have nobody. - Hold it, Sejo! Fuck the army and those who founded it! Hold it, Sejo. What did you say, Sejo? Sejo! Sejo! Stop! You've hit your father!? You fuckin'... You piece of shit! I'll smash your head in. "... to the presidency of SFR Yugoslavia, to the working class... "to working people, to nations and nationalities of SFRY: - "Comrade Tito is dead." - Dad... Dad. I'm staying here. To Du?ko
