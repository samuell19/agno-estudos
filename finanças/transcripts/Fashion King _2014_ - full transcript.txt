Visualeffects LIM Jung-hoon(Digital Studio 2L) sound supervisor LEE Seung-chul LEE Sung-jin(Wavelab) Produced by KANG Young-mo Enough of this nonsense. I'm sorry, sir. This thing that's inside me, the thing that I can't hide, it's swallowing me whole! "Dopeness" you mean? Il-jin, you can still maintain dopeness by freeing yourself. How can someone who doesn't own anything keep dopeness? Walk forward. Go see how outside people keep dopeness. Yes, sir. I shall be back. Directed by OH KI-HWAN FASHION KING Everything ends. Clouds, trees, and even humans will disappear in time. It all has an end, and I wait for my turn to come. I messed up this life. Dammit. 49 combos! Holy shit! 50 combos! 50! Holy shit! Yo, Wuss Gi-myeong! You fucking dipship! I was doing so well, and you went out of range! I died because of you! It's your damn fault! I'm sorry. Wu Gi-myeong (19) "Snack shuttle" Wuss Gi-myeong (19) "Snack shuttle" You screwed up my morning. Forget it. I skipped breakfast, so report to the corner store. Okay, got it. Where you going? Through here. I'll be back. Hurry! Isn't that blood? You never got beaten up in the morning. I'm late! Dammit! Where the hell have you been? Gi-myeong, come up. Who's that? Is he in our class? You don't know? Sung-chul's shuttle. Sung-chul, raise it upright! Attention, Gi-myeong is transferring to Seoul. His family is moving, so he's leaving. Go on, say good bye. Bye. Careful of the stairs. Hello. Get lunch from here, try black bean noodle! Gwak Eun-jin (19) Kian High Elite What, something on my face? - So ugly. - Wha? Seriously? How dare you say that to a girl. No, that. My bulldog? This is Won Bin. - Landlord's daughter? - Yes, hello. Top of the class, I heard. All the smart kids look so studious! Your name? I'm Gwak Eun-jin. I'll be cooking steaks later, come by for some. No, I got private class. Private class? Honey, you should go too before starting school. I'm so not interested. - Study hard. - Thank you. Common classes are downstairs. You? Ivy's top floor. Okay. What now? Your mom said to send a proof pic. I'm off. Yeah... She's coming, she's coming! Park Hye-jin (19) Queen of Kian High - So hot! - Holy shit! - Who the hell? - What the shit? Hi. Uh, hi. Kim Won-ho (19) Kian High Royalty Won-ho! Hungry? Yeah. Let's get dinner. - Did you wait long? - No. Hey. Yeah? Do you fight well? No. Then do you know Hye-jin? If you creep on her... It becomes rather awkward. No? Stand down! Answer me! Du-chi, that's enough. Sorry for the bad first impression. See that corner store? Go buy yourself some snack. It's my way of apology, so don't take it the wrong way. Take it. Should I get it for you? No, I'll get it myself. If you don't mind, could you get something for me too? Who the hell's that creeper? Photo collection of Hye-jin Won-ho's new padded jacket, so warm and cute! Son! Mom, knock! How was the private class? Was it okay? So-so. Tada! Cute, eh? Uniform's all the same. Mom. Could you buy me a padded jacket? Jacket? This one! $400 even after 60% off? Too expensive, right? Or so you thought I'd say? You never asked for anything, why the heck not, get the best one! Seriously! Really? Is it okay? But promise me one thing. Don't ever give up, always do your best. Can you promise me that? So hot! Is it spring already? I need short sleeves. The heck? Yo, Mr. Creeper! Peekaboo! I saw you get slapped for creeping on Hye-jin. Fucking pushover What, what's in your pocket, what's in there? That startled me. Give me the wallet back. Be grateful that you met me, you hear me? Newbie here, right? You look the part. But... What, what, what the fuck now? Do I really look like a pushover? Know die self, said Socrapitecus. Creepers like you don't deserve private audience with me. So fugly! Don't be scared, it's cool. Wait. How dare you wear Moncler? How much did it cost? - $400. - $400? When? How? - It was on sale. - You pushover! Designer jackets are never on sale! No, this is a limited special edition. No, this is a limited special edition, let me see! See? M-U-N! It's Muncler! See, I knew it! I saw you for what you are, you fucking Muncler. See here! M! U! U? Wait, wait, it can't be! By any chance, Bokhaksaeng... Dot com? We've been circling the block! Where the hell is it? Here! I know you're inside, come on out! Before I kick the door down, open this damn door! My dream is to be a cop! There's no future for you! Open in three! One! Two! Three! - Let's come back in the morning. - I'm friggin' pissed! You're surrounded, bastard! If it's locked from the outside, it's a sign that no one's in. Please come inside. So jackets bought from my site turned out to be fakes? It's far beyond just fakes, you took me for a... This yogurt's great. Follow me. It's written here, "Items listed here are imitations". Where? You got a hasty personality, right? - Be the patient type. - I am patient. I don't see shit. "Items listed here are imitations". Fucking shit! You fucking tricked us! Watch your mouth! It says these are stock items. And imitations are not? These were legally imported, it's your fault for not checking. Am I right or what? But selling imitation is illegal... I suddenly got an urge to go to the batting cage! But I don't wanna go outside! It's still a con. It says 'Moncler' in the title too. Moncler? But it's different on the patch. Muncler, you mean. We demand refunds. Damn, I stepped on a landmine. I should really quit. Kids, will buying designer jackets change anything? Yes. - Did you eat? - We did. Follow me. Where the hell is he going? Biz doing well? Nice color! Oh, good! Been a while! Just watch. Keep at it! Give me the hat! Your jacket! Let's go! Excuse me! Idiots, the thing about fashion is, the appeal is gone with your awareness of others. Even if you're penniless, you maintain your own... Principle! That's fashion in its purest form. Those who maintain that... Ooze special aura. Know what that's called? It's called "dopeness". Even in an Armani suit, some look like sheep, while others wear grease stained jeans with holes and look dope! Maintaining your own principle, not brands, is the way to attain dopeness. Dopeness is the only weapon against the strong! Got it? I don't see a trace of that in you! I don't wanna hear bullshits like 'refund'. Got it? Wait! Goddamn shit! Do you need a part timer? What? Packaging or chores, anything will do. Me too! Boss! Why am I your boss, asshole! Boss! Boss, look at me, pay attention to me too! I'm dope too. This is called 'Fashion Formula'. International fashion textbook, circa 1978. Who's the painter? Picasso, right? His life is worthless, what's the answer, Gi-myeong? Isn't it Kim Hong-do? Right, you're normal. Who here has the dopeness? The wrestlers? And you, Chang-ju? - The wrestlers, of course. - You'd think so, right? - No? - Watch carefully. The one with dopeness is... this chap. - With the fan? - Yup. When you divide the painting like this, and this, which quadrant has the most people? - Upper left. - That's right. Dopeness naturally attracts people. That's why people are crowded here. Now, look at the chap's posture. The match is extremely entertaining, but as a noble, he must maintain dignity. And after much internal deliberation, he settled with this fit pose. - What's "fit"? - Good question. "Fit" is how the clothes enhance the body. How well the clothes suit your body, creating dopeness out of one's fit, that's today's trend. Now, this chap is oozing dopeness all over, but isn't something off? What is? With this dope pose, and here, that sharp stare, what is he looking at? The answer is, the fine lady sitting across from him. The most important thing about fashion is... 'Fit'. Fit! Fit! One, two, three! Spread your legs. One, two, three! Tighten your buttcheeks! Look that way. I said look above! Dammit... One, two, three! Good! Your fingers! Yes, keep at it. - Come on, baby! - Come on, baby! Okay! New semester assembly will begin soon. - Please come to the gym. - This is it! Don't mistake it for a fashion show, got it? - You ready? - 'course! I've been waiting for today. It's the eye cleansing day. Cleanse your eyes with my ass. Move aside, you pig. Who... Here it comes! Such anticipation! My eyes! - My eyes! My eyes! - It's the flatty. - I don't feel so well! - Snap out of it! Who is she? It's Hanna. Is she looking at me? The tension radiating from her tight body... It's the belt. Bling, bling, bling! That shirt button is ready to burst! Dat button! Kim Hanna! Move aside, you nasties! You lemmings! Douche alert. Are you ready? Don't you feel chilly already? Our chic Hyuk-su, Kian High's ice king. He even rejected management offers! He's like an idol! Dat piercing! Dat jump! Such blinding light! It's Won-ho and Hye-jin! My 2 eyes cannot handle the two suns! 4 eyes, you mean. We're transported to an African desert. It's epic. Their hotness is epic. Too hot to the touch.. The hell? Wu Gi-myeong? Look at his bangs! Sacrificing his vision for fashion? Sacrificing vision... How many cylinders? 6? No, 4? No! 3.5 cylinders! It's the fashion king, bow down! That's against my religion. Did he just win her? With fashion? Excuse me! Who the hell? Quiet down, you idiot! Get back in line! Pardon moi. Excuse me! Excuse me! Interesting. It really is. Won-ho! Look over here! Is the prep going well? The Fashion King, I mean. It's going well. But something's on my mind. What could that be? There's someone who doesn't want my face on TV. Who? Girlfriend? Major Headache There just is. Someone with skeletons in the closet. The one... Who knows me too well. Could we talk? He doesn't like it, right? He wishes you'd concentrate on your studies. Let's get to the point. - When will you leave? - So dull! I'll talk to father myself. You know he's in the hospital to shield himself. So I'll talk to him in person! Let me see him. May I give you one advice, Won-ho? Do you want his acceptance? Then do what he asks. And drop this nonsense. Asshole! Get the hell up! Are you fucking nuts? Won-ho lost his appetite because of you! Du-chi must really enjoy his position in life. Is Won-ho Kian's top dog? Dunno about fights, but he rules everything else. Grades, looks, money... His dad just gives him money and stays away. Did you swallow your apology? I feel so terrible. Crawl through here! Are you nuts? Your life's over if you get involved! You scared? What? Because I'm not. Go! Enough. Me? I said enough. Buddy boy. Just because... These dickless dicks look up to you, you think you're all that? - Is that it? - It's not that. You don't look particular cool this way. Test me again, I'll fucking dent your skull! Wait. Gi-myeong, see that? - This is a Balmain. - $9,600 It's too much to just let it pass. Or will you reimburse me for it? This is pocket change to you. It is indeed, so what? So let it slide, he suffered enough. Enough? Who decides that? I'm the victim here, and why do you decide that? Then hit me. He's so cool! As you wish. Happy? Hey! Do it properly! You don't have the faintest idea, do you? What? Wanna see? See? Speechless. Come to the gym Gi-myeong! Hi. I didn't want weird rumors about this, so I asked you here. About what? Saturday is my birthday. Wanna come? That's my number, save it. Oh yeah! You're the only male invitee. Park Hye-jin Hey! What? Why're you following me? This is my way home too! We live under one roof, so don't trail behind me.. Walk alongside. - Gi-myeong. - Yeah? - Got plans this weekend? - Weekend? Well, what should I do... Let's go to the University Street... Don't even bring up university... Not the school, but the street... - Forget it. - Eun-jin! If a boy were to give you a gift, what'd you want? Well... What'd be good? - Perfume? - Wait for me! Roses? Chocolate? Hey! Hi. Who is he? What a wonderful day, So cute! It's that special day. It's your birthday. With a full heart, I say to you, happy birthday to you, oh my dear. I wish you a day full of joy and love. I wish you with my sincere heart. I cannot contain myself, how can I describe my feelings? I wish you nothing but happiness. And endless smiles. Let's celebrate together Happy birthday, Hye-jin! Happy birthday, Hye-jin! Hye-jin, he's adorable! - Who is he? - So cute! Thank you. So pretty. Gi-myeong, what's your dream? I have none. I messed up this life. Won-ho Where r u? Ur mom's coughing badly, get meds! Won-ho! Hye-jin. What're you doing here so late? Was it Gi-myeong? Yeah, why? Am I not allowed? Hye-jin, I've never lost anything of mine to anyone.. Don't reduce me to his level like this. Don't talk to me like that, am I your property? Happy birthday. Double whammy! Don't stay out so late! You said mom's sick! She really is, can't you hear her cough? My throat was dry since the morning. It's so dry... Ma'am, you can't do that! - You saw? - I did. You got glasses for a reason! It's mine! - Eun-jin. - Yeah? Take this. I picked it up while buying a b-day gift. Whose b-day? Someone. This is a quite a surprise. Epic SAT Prep! - Epic! - Like it? You want me to study till I die? Don't you like studying? Who likes studying! I do because I have to! I thought you wanted to go to the elite school. I'll do it just fine! Fine, I'll take it back. No way, I'll get to it in time. Hey, Gi-myeong. What? Am I really that ugly? - No... - Forget it! 2 seconds too late! They're both mine... Sports Day is just a disguised fashion show. Yes, that's right. More important than winning the game, the true winner is the one with dope uniform. It's a very unique tradition! Can't wait to find out who'll be the fashion king. Shall we check out the candidates? Tug-of-war first! Eun-jin is much too plain for a day like this! I can't tell if her mom came in her place. Definitely her mom. Ice king Hyuk-su is on fire today, he's flying high with edgy wings! Interesting choice, definitely a likely candidate! OMG! Hanna's see-through! Thank you G! See-through! See-through! That L'Oreal scent! No chance for the boys! I wish she'd throw me! I'll do that for you! Here's the pitch! They're after the ball! Look at 'em go! Today's highlight, Gi-myeong and Won-ho's relay battle! Who'll be crowned as Kian High Fashion King? Chang-ju and Du-chi are up first! Shoulder pad! - His should pads are something. - I'll kill you. Try it! Try it! And Chang-ju's wearing a dress. - Chang-ju! - Yeah? - Where's Gi-myeong? - He's getting ready. Chang-ju gets a head start! Chang-ju! I was a friggin' sprinter in junior high! Comere! Comere you bastard! Booster on! Look at 'em go! Du-chi's far behind! As they come around, next runners are standing by! What the hell? Won-ho, it's all up to you! It's Won-ho and Gi-myeong! The tension is unbearable! You actually wore this? Come on, run like hell! Why aren't you running? Have they dropped the batons? It's a battle of the nerves! Neither are running, what's happening here? Gi-myeong is sporting a vividly wild fashion! Won-ho looks plain beside him. What's that? Look at that, feather-powered shoulders! Such epic reimagining of gym uniform! Incredible display of fashion sense! Is this a shoo-in for Gi-myeong? Am I really seeing this in 21st Century? What's up with them? Are they using the track as the runway? They turned Sports Day into a fashion show... - EH! - PIC! It's breathtaking! - They're sweating! - Are they sick? Tension builds as they stroll towards the end! - Their bodies scream! - Of exhaustion! - Limits of human body! - Burning extreme calories! - It's all! - Heating up! It's an unforecasted typhoon! Could this be a result of Gi-myeong's hot dope air, and Won-ho's cool dope air that clashed on the track? Dopeness typhoon? They're struggling! Won-ho steps up, and becomes Michael Jackson? Is he! Flying? He's flying? He's airborne! Incredible! I'm sorry, I cannot describe this any better! He's in the air with armpit cape! This is the real Won-ho! He knew about the dopeness typhoon! Gi-myeong, snap out of it! It's a cooperative relay, and you put on a fashion show? Is this all a joke to you? Idiot! Are you a duck? A goose? Or a peacock? Push-up position. Sir. Hey, Won-ho. I have a shoot, I'll head out early. Won-ho, come over here. You sons of bitches! Get up! Gi-myeong, leave us. Won-ho. I got a call from your father's company. If you're gonna transfer, do it now, not later. Park Hye-jin. Gi-myeong: Gi-myeong: I'll put on a better show later! Dopeness! Congrats! We obtained Kyomiste trademark rights! Fucking fakes. Wu Gi-myeong? Isn't that Wuss Gi-myeong? Fucking country hick! He tries to rewrite history? He's one of a kind. He was always so obedient, so we took it pretty far. This is the real him? You guys had some fun! Once you start with Wuss Gi-myeong, there's no going back. Wuss Gi-myeong? Fucking Wuss Gi-myeong! Bro, who designed this? It's so dope! Well, who could've done this? It was Mr. Me. - Crazy! For real? - Bullshit! Children, samples are finally arriving today. I'm gonna go pick it up, so come on, baby! Come on, baby! - Have a good trip! - Okay! See you soon, bro! Come on, baby! Boys, we got a customer, show him the dopeness! Come on, ba... Won-ho... Why're you here? I wanted to browse. Better than I expected. But these are fakes.

Ms. Bong-nam! - Hello? - Are you Kim Won-ho? To your right, dickwad. So you reported me? Cocksucker, what did my clothes ever do to you? My lost so much over this! Over $45,000, asshole! So I'll compensate you, give me your bank info. What the shit? You laugh? This is a comical situation, right? Bank info? Sure, you can have it. Sure thing. It's on my phone. Here, take this. Laugh, go on! Have you gone mad? Grow old wisely. Don't go senile though. Du-chi. I warned you all. Meddling with me could hurt you. How is this fair? Can't press charges 'cos there's no witness? It's goddamn Won-ho for sure! Bro, wake up! Wake up and tell us it was him! This isn't right! Even if money solves everything, but this isn't right! That son of a bitch... I've fucking had it! Chang-ju! Won-ho, you fucking bastard! Cats drop their ears against a stronger foe, while dogs show their bellies. Know what humans do? Lower their eyes. Good. That's it. Why did you do it? Do what?

What, they hooked up? Hooking up with that loser? The day of Hye-jin's over. Ready, action. Wuss Gi-myeong! You disgust me! You bitch! Is it fun to mess with someone's feelings? Hey, hey! What's the story? Are you so desperate to hook up with him? Losers sticking together. You've overstepped your place! A match made in heaven. Hey. Just go to college, you fucking nerd. Before I kill you. The show's over! - So full of himself. - He's disgusting! I knew it all along. You okay? Yeah. You? I'm sorry you hurt your studying hand. You study with your head, not hands. Don't mind those bozos! Go back out there and walk proudly. Protect yourself so that they can't touch you. Am I right? Thank you, Eun-jin. With my wound, I treat yours, thereby consoling you. Oh yeah, I have a question. What? Am I really ugly? So out of the blue. You're not ugly. Fail! You didn't answer instantly. You're not! You really aren't! Wu Gi-myeong! There's no excuse for skipping! You were gonna run, right? - To Busan this time... - And once there, you'll run again if someone digs your background? Will you keep transferring until graduation? Are you a celeb? Running away from paparazzi? - Bro, I... - Idiot! Chang-ju! You were the only one. The only one who stood up to that bastard Won-ho. Come back! Bro! This is Fashion King's Han Hyejin! I'm at Kian High today. Why am I here? To meet rising star Kim Won-ho. Shall we go see him? Go all the way - Kim Won-ho is.. - He's... he's... If I could be born again... - He's Kian High's... - Embodiment of dopeness. Be quiet. He's the spine of our school. Even I want to marry him. So hot! This is rising star Kim Won-ho, welcome. Good afternoon. What are you prepping these days? I'm readying to enter the Fashion King. Will you abandon your mystical concept now? There is no such a thing. I just want to be accepted by someone. I'll enter the contest and stand tall in front of this person. Who could this be? It's a secret. I'll reveal it when I reach the finals. One last question, what is 'fashion' to you? Well, the dignity you're born with? I'm kidding, please edit this part out. That was Kim Won-ho. Style No. 1's Fashion King invites you to the runway! Become a challenger! Son! Are you okay? Has it been tough? Should we move again? Become a challenger! Mom, I won't run away anymore. I found something I want to do. - Bro. - Hey. I need your help. With what? Help me, like you did before. Give it up, Fashion King's for the rich. I was on the 1st season and they messed me up. You don't think I reported Won-ho? The cops won't investigate, saying there's no evidence. It's messed up. But what can we do, this is the reality. We can't win against those born with silver spoon. Bro. You said so yourself. Our only weapon against the strong... Dopeness. Goddammit... I'm quitting smoking. You ready for some serious dopeness? Yes, I'll go all the way! Let's do it right! - Come on! - Baby! With customized muscle training, you'll challenge yourself to what we all desire: 'total dopeness' Level up! It's our time to level cap dopeness! Depending on how you develop and grow your muscles, your fit will change. You must get into all known poses by working your biceps and triceps. No, this is too scary! Enhance! Let your arm muscles fly high! Enhance the fit! Enhance the fit! Enhance the fit! Enhance the fit! Senior Gwak Eun-jin accepted to SEOUL U Mr. Kim Nam-jung? What the hell... We're at the scene of Fashion King preliminaries. 100 participants have smashed through competition to be here. The anticipation is heating up! Let's now meet one at a time. With this opportunity, there's something I want to prove. Excuse me! Excuse me! This is the 4th season... Gi-myeong. Do your best. We're ready to begin. Please gather around. Welcome to Style No. 1's Fashion King. 100 Fashion King contestants are here, all eager to accept the runway ticket. But there are only 20 tickets. Who will be invited to the main event? 1st mission! Style battle! Start! Okay! Let's do this! Good! - Come on! - Baby! Style Battle Preliminary Round! Obtain Fashion Stickers! The first mission is crucial. You must be picked by a tailor. Objectivity and precision are Fashion King's motto. With such quick moves, he's being dragged out! Won-ho's turn, look at that confidence. Pass! He wasn't even measured. Pass! His head is being measured! What a surprising move! His head got him a pass! - Gi-myeong's turn. - He looks a bit nervous. He puts his foot forward. That attitude! Betting it all on his foot. - It got him a pass! - Thank you! Those who pass the mission receive a sticker. Only the top 20 with the most stickers go to the main event! Now! We're going through various obstacles to select the Fashion King. Asian models and fashion are very trendy nowadays. That's right. So we have a special mission. This will determine candidates' inner Asian beauty. It feels like I'm in Paris, atop Montmartre hill... And doing a traditional mask dance... Nice. Pass! Dunno what he's saying but he's got it. Next. Such tacky color! Feels so cheap but he's got that something! Like an addiction! So dirty! So cheap! Pass! Awesome! Thank you! He's a character. Like an unfilial son, who never visits his parents' grave... Oh daddy! Pass! Thank you! So firm... Like a wild raccoon... lost in the mountain. That stupid hair feels special. Pass! Gi-myeong's no joke. He was just a dickwad in the past. Buddy, the past isn't important, what matters is now. Shut it! Won-ho will crush him in time. - Shit. - Head. You Mike Tyson doppelganger! All the so-called 'fashion terrorists' have gathered in one place. Don't shun them because of their fashion. They have hawk eyes for distinct fashion sense! - Next mission! - Start! Selected! The selected participants look so happy. The outcome of this competition is depended on their selection. Chang-ju and Du-chi are selected! Those selected... Are out! Once you're selected by the terrorists, you're out! Here are the 20 final candidates! There's Fabian, looking confident! And monk Il-jin! He passed the preliminaries. Won-ho's confident smile! No doubt he passed, congrats! Congratulations, how do you feel now? This is just the beginning, there are more missions... No stickers? Tada! Congrats, Gi-myeong! You've shown us very unique fashion, how do you feel now? I got here thanks to Nam-jung and Chang-ju. Of course! I designed everything you see. Fabulous! Congratulations. I'll try even harder and pass the next stage too. Thank you! Great job! Yes! Don't snub school work. Okay. You're in the main event. You're hot right now. Everyone's talking about you. Is that so? Gi-myeong. My head is saying no, but my heart... Wants you. Where the heck is she? MAIN SUIT MISSION Complete in 1 minute! Diamond is a girl's best friend! What about a boy's? - Suit? - What? - The very definition of men fashion! - What's that? Suit styling is the final mission before the runway. 3-piece suit, of course. 3-piece... Right! It's the final chapter of Fashion Formula... I went through it too slowly... Will he be okay? Don't they look a little nervous? If they are, I could go hug them one by one! - I'll help with that! - Don't be so crude! All right, the suit mission! Start! This mission consists of walking through 5 rooms and selecting 5 items, but pay attention: a booby trap item is hidden in each room. And they have 1 minute to get through? - That's right. - Reason to get nervous. - Isn't it? - Yeah. First contestant, look at those shoes. - This is monk Il-jin. - Indeed. - He's using the monk concept. - Looks like it. Pass! All pass! - Hyuk-su's turn. - Let's take a look. He confidently picks up polka dot tie. Let's see. It's a collection of all patterns! - Indeed. - It's simply too much. Next up is Fabian. Brazilian exchange student? Hope he washed his hair. He's panicking. What is that? That's no good... That's a taking a dump pose, it's repulsive. Next is the contest favorite, Won-ho. - He looks relaxed. - Absolutely.

Listen, pay attention to shoulder seams, and... I can't hear you. He's floundering, what's he up to? - Shoulder pad, look for that. - What pad? Shoulder fucking pad! Pick the red one behind you! He's moving on. Hey! Pocket's important on pants. No, something else! Nothing there, back off! What the hell! Turn around naturally! - That's a terrible choice! - Don't get that! Shouldn't I match top and bottom? Pick something else! - Look at the time! - Time's running out! You're not the Korean flag! Could he be our first time over? He's scratching his head. Get the black! The black! He's panicking! Is this the end for Gi-myeong? What do I do? Gi-myeong. It's over. Better luck next year. Bro! - And he's out! - But it's the booby trap! Dammit! No arm holes! It's over...

Do you not understand? My wife and son hate you being here. I could overthrow such petty competition, so walk away. "Petty competition"? I'll see it through no matter what. I don't have a father anymore. After the competition, I'll disappear from your life. How's it going? Hey. - Won Bin? - Yup. Hey there! He's gotten so heavy! Isn't it funny? How could I design anything that fits such luxurious dress? I'm too scared even to touch it. It's still just a dress. So pretty. Don't match the dress, but match your heart to the woman wearing this. Try to feel that, you idiot! - Go on. - What? Hug me. Do you feel anything? Semi-finals Boyfriend Mission Steal Han Hyejin's heart! Fashion King, the final 4! New rising stars' mission! Start!

Weddings must end with a limousine ride! What's that? Hi, it's me. He's wearing a Ms. Han-printed shirt! I don't know what to say... Was he really this cool? You didn't plan this for him? Having met you, each day is a blessing. And I learned what a true love is. Let's not forget our time together and live happily ever after! I love you so much! He's giving his jacket to her. It's like they're becoming one. Also putting his hat on her. Scissors? He boldly cuts off the dress into a mini one piece dress! The 2 contestants who stole Ms. Han's heart! Who could they be? So it's just you and me. You've fought well. Why do you hate me so much? Let me ask you something. What is it that you need? I do this out of 'want', not 'need'. Yeah? Shall we be more frank? I'll give you enough money, so forfeit the finals. Then give me $10 million. Won-ho. Are you making a threat? Threat? No. This is a statement. Don't make me the bad guy anymore. I'd hate to keep sending your people to the ER. Gi-myeong! Won-ho! Sorry I'm late! You guys are something! The ratings are off the charts! The final mission is, 'the clothes that represent my life'.

Mom, why're you in such a good mood? Because I have a special gift. What is it? Something I really want to do for you. What is it? Be patient. Dessert time! For his sake, don't let Gi-myeong continue. Even as your mom, I never knew... I only told you not to give up... I'm so sorry, son. Honey, let's give up. You did more than enough. Are you scared of this? Because I'm not. I AM scared, I don't want you to get hurt! So please stop! We didn't move so much for you to get hurt like this. How can I watch you get hurt? I've been running away. Where else can I go? Tomorrow is the day, when I can stand tall. Please trust me. No, please don't go. You're all I got! Whoa, Gi-myeong. Woke up? Do you remember? What? So tacky, right? It is. But so similar. What is? The day you moved to my place, I was so happy to meet someone like me. But you looked so down, as if you were done with life, and it bothered me. But seeing your true self, I'm so happy. - Eun-jin. - Yeah? - I... - Yeah? Nam-jung, Chang-ju... And you... You know how much I like you all, right? Let's see! Make-up? Okay! - Where's Gi-myeong? - He's not here yet. What are you doing? Call him up! Now! That bitch. Asshole. Me? Why? You don't like money? She's the honest one. We just need to make tons of money. Study hard, idiot. So much stalling. Producer Song, what's happening? One moment. What happened? We can't find him, he's not answering his phone. You should've kept taps on him! Keep calling! He's not here yet? - What do we do? - Hello. Won-ho. Get on the stage first. We'll start with him. This is Style No. 1's Fashion King. Thank you for waiting, we've reached the finals. Are you okay? Don't get up. Are you okay? We'll watch Won-ho's show first. His mission is Gi-myeong's school uniform. - Ma'am, where are you? - Has he arrived yet? He's not answering his phone. Eun-jin, I think he... Let's see how he transformed his peer's uniform to represent his life. The lights are finally out. Here are the 2 contestants. With thundering applause, Won-ho rises to the stage. Wait, looks like right side is empty. Bro, isn't Gimyeong supposed to be there? Has Gi-myeong not shown up? Did something happen? - Where is he? - If he does not show up... - Then, forfeit? - Yes, it should be. Here he comes. Simply amazing! Look at that charisma! What a transformation! A military vest over - Gi-myeong's uniform! - That's right! - He says he made it himself. - Still no answer. Thus completing a military style. What's he doing? You simply can't top that. - The final touch! - Nice! Striking a final pose for his fans! Yes, okay. Han Hyejin's so hot. No wonder she's a model... Isn't that Gi-myeong? - He looks injured. - Should we call the producer? Yeah, call him. Gi-myeong, what happened? Who did this? Don't cry. Let's go to the hospital first. Eun-jin. I'm fine. Why didn't you tell me? This is not right! I'm fine. You idiot! Producer, Gi-myeong's here! He is? But he's in a bad shape! What? Send a cam and start rolling. Good, good, this could create some drama. Navy officer uniform, interpreted from Gi-myeongGi-myeong's uniform. A long vest on top of the uniform. Why have you chosen this attire? What does it represent? This was my father's, who passed away. He was a navy officer. I wanted to stand tall, and show how much I've grown. I believe he's watching me from above. When I win... I will shout his name. Excuse me. Gi-myeong! Excuse me, pardon me. Gi-myeong! Mom. Son! What happened? Why? Who did this to you? What did I tell you? We should have given up, I told you! Mom, I'm okay. - Let's go to the ER! - No, mom, no! Not there. I'm sorry, I tried to protect it. I tried so hard. Gi-myeong, are you nuts? How can you go to the finals like this? Please help me. The cam's rolling, let's get you fitted! Do you want me to get fired? Let's do it. - There's no time... - You heard me! Gi-myeong, remember what I said? Dopeness... Is our only weapon against the strong. This is what you are. Let's live a dope life! Bro... Eun-jin, your necklace. Stand up. Let's do it. - That was so moving. - Gi-myeong's standing by. Won-ho, please get to your position. Next up, we have Gi-myeong's special runway. In an unprecedented move, his runway has to be off-stage. Hi. Won-ho. I didn't use the money you gave me. Thanks. There's a corner store nearby, buy yourself some snack. Could you get me some on your way back? Won-ho, please come back to your spot. That idiot... Even after an unexpected accident, Gi-myeongGi-myeong completed his mission, big round of applause please! You're so awesome! We'll now begin Gi-myeong's runway walk. Please come up to the runway. Gi-myeong, let's put on a show! Let's go! As Gi-myeong prepares, the jury will tally the scores and choose the Fashion King. - Come on! - Baby! Everything ends. Clouds, trees, and even humans will disappear in time. So, I will not give up this moment. Because I am alive. I'm not Wuss Gi-myeong anymore. The Fashion King is... I am Wu Gi-myeong. Ladies and gents. He wore this during the contest. But he was supposed to wear this. Who designed it? Me, Kim Nam-jung! Enhance the fit! Enhance the fit! This is so embarrassing! Wanna go back to being a loner? - Enhance the fit! - That's it! Enhance the fit! Monk Il-jin! - What have you learned? - Sir. Dopeness is the only weapon against the strong! How about it? Do I have it?
