Mr. Eiseley, my condolences. He was a good man. He was a good man. Thank you for coming out. Mr. Eiseley! Your father owes my bank $5,000. Owes? That's right.

Oh, I came down here hoping to find some work on the railroad, but It's not often enough that we find it. What about you, what do you do? I don't know anymore. Four percent of the American people own eighty five percent of the wealth of America. How many men ever went to a barbecue and would let one man take off the table what's intended for nine-tenths of the people to eat? What's Morgan, and Baruch, and Rockefeller, and Mellon gonna do with all that grub? Leave something else for the American people to consume! We say to America 125 million Hey Gus. Hey Stratton. Could I use your phone? You bet. Thanks. No luxurious mansions empty! None walking the streets. None impoverished! None in war! But that all may live in the land that the Lord has provided Could I have 1868 please? Thank you. How are you Susan? I was uh I was wondering um I was wondering if I could borrow some money? Susan, you know this isn't easy for me. The bank took everything. Damn right it is! What the hell is that suppose to mean? Well while your at it, why don't you uh, pin the stock market crash on us too! Shit! Well I better be off Gus. Alright, we'll see ya. Thank you. Alright, tell me your grand idea. Alcohol. You want us to make liquor? What do you say huh? Partners in crime? Are you crazy? We can't make moonshine here! Not here. The mountains. Ah, I don't know Stratton I look around and I see a lot of people waiting. Waiting for food, waiting for jobs, waiting for the dollar waiting for it to improve. Look at that open space. There's a life up there to be lived. What about supplies? We don't have anything. I kept a few things from my pop's place. Enough to get us started. Alright. Alright, we'll do it. We just going to have to convince Grandpa I don't think this is a good idea. It'll be like it was before. We can hunt and live in the old ways again. We never sold whiskey, it's not the Indian way. That's the only difference. And we don't have to live by the White's laws anymore. What if they find us? No, Stratton, he knows of place where we'll never be found. ♪ Oh bury me not on the lone prairie ♪ ♪ These words came low and mournfully ♪ ♪ From the pouted lips of a youth who lay ♪ ♪ On his dying bed at the break of day ♪ ♪ Oh bury me not on the lone prairie ♪ ♪ Where the coyote howls and the wind blows free ♪ Two whiskeys.

Alright Gus. Here's uh 30 cents for the whiskey and here's 30 cents for you to give them to me. Alright, but its the last time! You're my man Gus! When money's tight and hard to get, and your horse is an also ran, when a pile of debt is all you got, glass a whiskey, is your only man. I'll drink to that. So uh, when did your people start ranching? I must've been about eight or nine. When we were younger, we were still hunters, but times change. It's tough for Grandpa. When the spring comes I can see it in his eyes, he's, he still seems to be searching the horizon waiting for the buffalo to return. You know they never do. Those teepee days are gone for good. That's a shame. Hey Joe! You want to make some money? This here's Whistler, he handles our runs. Whistler here's the list, show the boys the store room. Alright, come on boys. How about a topic, before Rhett drowns himself in a dreamy whiskey sea. How about something on the frontier? Uh, Grace Loren? Yes, yes I'm Gracie, call me Gracie. Stratton Eiseley. Alright where do you want the whiskey? Oh, just stack them over here. "I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life" "..to drive life into a corner. And reduce it to its lowest terms, and if it proved to be mean, well, get to the whole and genuine meanness of it." It's a pleasure to meet you folks. You shouldn't be here son I'm sorry this is private property. didn't have anywhere to sleep. Well, I'm sorry about that, but I can't have you here. Listen, do you think I can just sleep here a couple more hours? I'll be out by first light, I promise. Well... I'd awfully appreciate it. You be sure to be out of here real early. And please don't make a habit of this. No sir, I won't. Okay. Thank you. Hey! Jeez, Stratton. You scared the hell out of me. What you doing sleeping on the job Whistler? What if I'd been Jim Harris? Thank God you ain't! That be like waking up to a rattler in your pants. Well, what can I do for you? Well. What do you say to me taking over for the night? Uh, I don't know. I need the money We'll split it 50-50. What's the catch? No catch. I need the money too. 50-50? Alright, I can do that. Yeah. Here's your list. I suppose you know the rest. You bet.

You want to go for a walk, maybe get out of here for a little bit? Yes. My father didn't have much faith in the government, so ranching was a way to get him out of town and pretty much out of the system. But today, there's too many damn laws and regulations you know Thomas Jefferson, he envisioned a country governed and supported by farmers, but today the government just tries to rip the rug right out from under them. The way I see it, moonshine can't be regulated. They either catch me, or they don't. So you're a writer. How did you know I'm a writer? I mean, who else quotes Thoreau at a party? What kind of stuff do you write? I'm a novelist but lately, I've been writing screenplays. You write for the pictures? So surprised? No, no, I just ain't never seen a picture written by a woman that's all. Does that mean I can't? No, no, I'm just making an observation. Yeah well, I don't think a pair of testicles is gonna make me any better at writing stories and putting them down on paper. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to Uh huh. So you're a writer. Long ago, some grizzlies turned themselves into human beings and came to live among my people. They dressed in bear skins and wore bear claw necklaces. And they would rub red clay into their bodies so hard, they'd be covered in blood. The bear people killed every enemy. If one of their own was killed, their medicine was so strong, they could bring the dead back to life. One day, a warrior from my tribe named Owl, lost in battle and went to the leader of the Bear Clan for help. The chief of the bears said this "I am chief of the bears! I cannot be killed! I have brought you here to give you my medicine." From then on, Owl could not be killed in battle. That is the story of the Bear People, who were great healers and could never be killed. The smoke will protect you from the elk's nose and bring you no harm. You go up around towards the meadow and I'll come around. Good luck. Yep, you too. Did you see anything? Stratton? Did you see anything? Uh no. You want to, you want to line this bead up on the end now, with your notch back here. And it's important to keep it firm against your shoulder otherwise it'll knock the hell out of you. Now I don't want to overload you with too many things but, you want to exhale just before you take your shot and when you do You don't want to pull the trigger, you just want to slowly squeeze it. Alright? Let me go set the cans up. Okay You ready? Yeah, I think so. Like this? Yep, yeah uh, now uh make sure you hold it tight. And make sure you line up that bead.

You know they do, matter fact, that's why we stopped you. You know Don and I have been sitting out here all day in this hot sun, we surely could use something wet. Well, there's plenty extra in the bed there. Yeah, looks like it. Five cents a pop. Really? That's soda pop! Where's the whiskey? I knew all you really wanted was a cocktail, but Don't be smart with me you son of a bitch! I don't appreciate you referring to my mother like that. Don, smash those crates. But boss, its just soda pop. I could give them to my kids. I said smash them!

"Where in the past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the power of the air. The same spirit now worketh in the children of disobedience, among whom we had our conversations about the lusts of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath." Damn it. Oh its nothing under heaven but an attempt to bind and rivet the old breweries and the old distilleries around the neck of the American people for their own profit. Where will the money come from? They say that Uncle Sam" So no luck with Gracie? No. Give me two. "I'll fight the saloon from the Hawaii to Hoboken, I'll kick it as long as I have a foot. I'll punch it as long as I have a fist. I'll butt it as long as I have a head. I'll bite it as long as I have a tooth ." Stratton, there's some old Indian here to post your bail. Joe's grandfather he says. Hi, Gracie. I came to apologize. Would you let me in so we can talk like civilized people? Oh why start now? Gracie, I'm sorry. Now would you please let me in? What about the money? I'm sure you're quite willing to share my bank account I don't want your goddamned money. Even now you still think it's about the money? How are you going to make a living up here? You going to marry some simpleton rancher? Let's face it Gracie, you need me. I need you like a hole in my head. I would rather starve to death than spend another night in your bed wondering how many ditsy actresses you made it with that day. That only happened once! Oh, should I name them? Let's see, Susie, Caroline Just stop. Stop. You listen to me. You can't leave me, I won't allow it. Who the hell are you? Stop it! Stratton stop it, he's my husband! We're getting a divorce, and I What? Stratton... Gracie. How you doing Joe? Better than some apparently. He won't even talk to me, huh? Well he's pretty angry. What about you, Joe, are you angry at me too? It's none of my business. Hey, why don't you come up to camp before you go and have some coffee. Huh? Sorry you came all the way up here, but Stratton's pretty stubborn. I thought you come to see me. Oh you're wonderful Flying Bear, you can always make me feel better. I thought we were gonna have a chess game. Well maybe you could come to my house and we could play there. She already asked me to come to her house, Stratton should know better than to leave me alone with his woman. Grandpa! You should be ashamed of yourself! Actually I was going to invite all three of you to my house tomorrow to watch some films. You can show movies at your house? Yeah, I have a western and a Felix the Cat short. You have Felix the Cat at your house? You've seen Felix the Cat? He's the number one fan! Please convince Stratton to come tomorrow night. I'll do my best. Bye Joe. See you Gracie. Welcome to the Gracie Loren picture show. Hi Stratton. Gracie. Hey, where'd you get the projector from? Collected under the philanderers tax never mind. Oh, I made popcorn. Hi Gracie. What are you doing here? I was driving by and I uh Driving by? Well anyway, I'm here now. I see your friend's here again. Maybe we could shake hands, make up. I don't think that's such a good idea. Just let me introduce myself around. My God! It's like a wild west show in here! Cowboys and Indians and the whole bit. I don't believe we've officially met, my name is Michael Giovanni. So Stratton, ever fought a duel? You do have a pair of pearl handled six shooters don't ya? Michael, we're trying to watch the movie. You okay? Don't you think he'd look good in a white cowboy hat? Coming in to save all the maidens in distress? Stratton where are you going? Wait! Stratton please don't go! Damn it Michael, I want you out of my house! Not my fault the cowboy can't take a joke. I guess your hearing ain't so good, Gracie said she wanted you out of her house! Alright, alright. I'm going. We better go get Stratton he's pretty drunk. Stratton I'm sorry. Come here. Sometimes Stratton, I look at you and I see someone else. From another time, its as if we've been lovers before. ♪ Rock of ages ♪ ♪ cleft for me ♪ ♪ let me hide myself in thee ♪ ♪ Let the water and the blood ♪ ♪ from thy wounded side which flows ♪ Have a seat! ♪ Cleanse the pure and trouble free ♪ ♪ Rock of ages hide thou me ♪ Praise the Lord! Amen. So uh, you the sheriff in these here parts? Shut up! Quit squirming and tell me who I'm talking to. My name is Michael Giovanni. Italian name? Yes sir. You don't look Italian. My family is from Northern Italy. Gandy dancer? I beg your pardon? Do you work on the railroad? The railroad? No. Uh, I'm from California. That figures. So, what can I do for you? Well, I have some information about an illegal liquor distillery. Alright, we're burning daylight. Let's go. What are you doing? Tom's supposed to pick up another load this afternoon. He just did a run yesterday. Can you give me hand with this? Don't you think we have enough money? What do you mean? I mean, do we really need to do another run so soon? Going soft on me? We already got caught once, I just think it's risky. You worry too much. Ah. Damn it! Stratton, why don't we just go back to camp. Let's just wait a little longer. If he's not here by now, he isn't coming. Well then we'll do it by ourselves. Who was it that said, we don't do runs anymore? I'll see you in the morning then. You're a fool you know that? Where's Stratton? He's making the deliveries himself. I thought you hired a runner. He didn't show. Civilization and society rests on morals. Morals rest on religion. Religion rests on the Bible and on faith in God and in Jesus Christ! The Bible doesn't condemn any man because of his wealth. The Bible says that the man that don't provide for his family is worst than an infidel! America needs a title wave of the old time religion! According to our standard of gold and Boys how we doing? Good. Carson, come over here for a minute. What do you know Harris? Damn sight more than you. How's my boy from Kentucky been? Good, good. That's great! No problems at all? Nary a one. Hey listen, take, take that hat off and let me get a look at you. You know the thing I like about you is: you've always been good at math. Now I don't know about that! No listen, you are, you are. For example, I mean if one of these crates went out of here with 15 jars in it rather than 20, you'd, you'd notice that wouldn't you? Yeah, yeah. Of course I would. Yeah, sure you would. That you will never rest until this of God hating, Christ hating, whiskey soaked, Sabbath breaking blaspheming, infidel, bootlegging old world is bound to the cross of Jesus Christ by the golden chains of love! Oh, thank God you're okay. I was so worried. You don't have to worry anymore. Joe and I decided that's our last run. I'm glad. Did you sell all of it though? Don't worry there's plenty extra. So are you going to retire to some exotic destination now? Well I thought I might move to Californy, make a life in motion pictures. Oh, my dreams have come true. It's funny. Now that I have some money, I don't have a clue what to do with it. I'm starting to understand the old ways that Flying Bear talks about. Living here is true freedom. What do you say to shacking up with a mountain man? Isn't that what I'm doing? I guess it is.
