(SOLEMN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SOLEMN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) HILARY: Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Merry Christmas. NEIL: And I'm not talkin' about a new pair of trousers. An old pair, just lyin' there. JANINE: Oh, yeah. See, I used to do that. When my mum wouldn't let me wear my miniskirt out of the house. I just got changed in the back row. NEIL: Also, used nappy. Popcorn bucket with vomit inside. JANINE: Ugh. Yeah. Whole cooked chicken in a Safeway bag. How about you, Hils? What's the worst thing you've found? Anything interesting? Um, dead body. Had a heart attack during Smokey and the Bandit. Took three people to move him. Bloody hell. Well, that's killed the mood. (LAUGHS) (BOTH LAUGH) What the fuck? Blimey! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER) (SEABIRDS CAWING IN DISTANCE) (SPITS) (PLACES TOOTHBRUSH) (HEAVY BREATHING) (OPENS LID) (PILLS RATTLING) (CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY ON SPEAKERS) (MUSIC STOPS) LAIRD: Headaches? Nausea? No. LAIRD: Sleeping all right? Yes. Good. Shall we weigh you? LAIRD: Mmm. Not ideal. Four pounds heavier. How do you feel, generally? Fine. LAIRD: Do you feel better since leaving St. Jude's? Yes. Any big mood swings? No, not really. Good. Stable. That's good. (LAIRD HUMMING TUNE) I do feel a bit... LAIRD: Hmm? Numb, I suppose. Well, I'm sure that'll wear off as soon as you get used to the lithium. It's marvelous stuff. And you do have people you could talk to, I assume? Family, friends? Oh, yes. (JERSEY BOUNCE BY BENNY GOODMAN PLAYING) Hilary, do you have a partner? Yes. No, I don't think so. Excellent. This is Bill. Bill, this is Hilary. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Apologies in advance. (JERSEY BOUNCE CONTINUES) NEIL: I mean, it's so depressing. He's just dronin' on and on. You wake me up when it's over. JANINE: Oh, piss off! (SINGING) No, don't! You're gonna break it. (NEIL WHIMPERING) No, don't! You're gonna break it. NEIL: Janine! Stop the... (YELPS) (LAUGHTER) God, you're a tosser. I am a tosser, but I did try. Yeah. Yeah, whatever. Listen, come back, Supertramp, all is forgiven! (SINGING) (NEIL SCATTING) (LAUGHTER) (CONTINUES SINGING) What on earth is going on? Sorry, Mr. Ellis, Janine was playing us something on her Walkman. ELLIS: Well, you can all calm down. Janine, if you're at a loose end, perhaps you'd like to come and do tickets for us? Trevor hasn't shown up again, so we're short. JANINE: But it's my lunch break. It doesn't look like you were eating much lunch. Well, yeah, 'cause I haven't had the chance yet. My heart bleeds. Outside. (JANINE SIGHS) Hilary, perhaps you and I could discuss that whole Trevor situation in my office? Ten minutes. Yes, of course. (ELLIS BREATHING HEAVILY) ELLIS: Suck me. HILARY: No. Please. Suck me off. HILARY: No, let's just keep... (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) Just like this. Like this. (DOOR CLOSING) (YOU'RE BLASE BY ELLA FITZGERALD PLAYING SOFTLY) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DOOR OPENS) WAITER: Good evening, sir. How can I help you? ELLIS: Table for two, please. (DOOR CLOSES) WAITER: Can I take your coat? Thank you. WAITER: May I take your order, madam? Oh, I'm not sure... (HESITATES) You know, I've just realized, I'm really late for an appointment. I'm terribly sorry. (VEHICLES PASSING OUTSIDE) So, Stephen here will be replacing Trevor, who was never here anyway. So, he's already off to a flying start. (CHUCKLES) Anyway, this is Neil, who does Box Office mostly. Nice to meet you. Hiya. Norman, our projectionist. All right? Hello. And Janine, who'll be collecting tickets with you. Watch out for her strange musical tastes. (CHUCKLES) It can't be worse than mine. (GIGGLES) Hiya. STEPHEN: Hi. ELLIS: Frankie, Brian and Finn with the... hair. BOTH: Hello. STEPHEN: Hey. And our esteemed duty manager, Hilary. She also does sweets and snacks. Hello. Hello. So, I'll leave you all to get better acquainted. Hilary will show you the ropes. Make sure you take the packet from the front otherwise it never gets sold then it gets dusty. Okay. (EXHALES) That smell must make you hungry. You're never tempted to sneak a handful? No. I didn't mean to steal it, I just meant... Try to keep a tab of the items you sell and then make sure you replace them at the end of your shift. This is Screen One. Wicked. HILARY: Mmm. You'll have to do final cleanup if you're on late shift. Make sure to check for sleepers. (CHUCKLES) Really? Yes. One chap used to bring in an air mattress. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Projection booth. Don't go in. Norman's very particular. You stand at the bottom of these stairs. And, make sure you keep hold of the ticket stubs, then bring them back to me so I can check them against admissions. Okay. So, when do we, you know, open up? Erm... Twenty minutes. What's up there? Public aren't allowed. Can I have a look? Oh, I'm not sure. Go on. Please. STEPHEN: Oh, my God. It's a whole other cinema. HILARY: Used to be four screens. HILARY: Screen Three. Screen Four. (DOOR OPENS) Best for last. (CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING) (PIGEONS FLUTTERING) Wow. (FLUTTERING CONTINUES) STEPHEN: What a place. HILARY: It really was beautiful. It still is. Another world. (PIGEON COOING) Look at this little fellow. It's all right. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) It's all right. It's all right. (SHUSHING) (PIGEON CONTINUES COOING) I think he's broken his wing. (SIGHS) He needs a bit of help. HILARY: I don't think he likes it. STEPHEN: It's okay, he's fine. Aren't you? Here, hold him. Oh, no, no. I don't like birds. Oh, come on. Look. Come on. Go like this. (HILARY GASPS) Oh. There you go. He loves it. Look, he prefers you. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Now... What're you doing? Special trick. You okay? Yeah. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You ready? Hold him still. Yes. HILARY: Oh. (CHUCKLES) Good boy. You can put him down now. (BOTH CHUCKLE) What happens when he needs the loo? (BOTH CHUCKLE) NORMAN: Nine across. Five letters. Word that starts a Waste Land. April. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Morning, Hils. Morning. Norman. Got your glad rags for tonight? Yes. And I brought those in for later. Ooh, I say! So, we could go down Misty's off Tivoli Road, if we can get in. Or that club, Hades, at the Lido... Hello. ...has got a good DJ. Yeah, maybe, yeah. NEIL: What's all that? It's my stingy brim. My three-button tonic for tonight. NEIL: Didn't have you down as a Rude Boy. What you goin' on about? Rude boy, you know? Two Tone. NORMAN: Who-tone? STEPHEN: Two Tone. The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat. I don't understand a single word you're sayin'. (STEPHEN LAUGHS) It is a bit like reggae, but dance music. It's like fast reggae. Always fancied one of these. Yeah, you've got the reggae ska side, and then you've got the punk side. You know, Black and white together. It's a melting pot. JANINE: Mmm. God help us. STEPHEN: What about you, Hilary? Gonna come dance with us? Oh, no, I shouldn't think so. It's not really my thing. Discotheques. Bloody nightmare. So, what're you gonna do? Um, I dunno, I thought I might go onto the roof, watch the fireworks. Nice. Where's all your mates, anyway? Buggered off to college. Ah, that's where I'm goin'. NORMAN: Good luck with that. (JANINE LAUGHS) STEPHEN: Well, off we go, then. Another day, another four pounds fifty. Oh, God. Oh, my God. He is such a much of a hunk. Now that is on the cards. (CLEARS THROAT) Screen One, top of the stairs. Enjoy. JANINE: Upstairs, Screen One. Okay? Thank you. Enjoy the film. I'm looking forward to it. (JANINE LAUGHING) Yes, sir. That's the 8 o'clock up and runnin'. So, what time are you clocking off? Where are the ticket stubs? I gave 'em to Janine. Where's Janine? Shit. I think she went early. You had one thing I asked you to do. One thing. Yeah, I know, but I thought that I could... (ANGRILY) It's completely unacceptable! All right, there's no need to... It's unprofessional! Impersonating the customers, laughing behind their backs! People come here for a nice time, not to be laughed at! Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Good. Just don't laugh at people. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DOOR OPENS) Hilary, when you're done later, why don't you pop into the office for a quick drink? Oh, I don't know. No, come on. Just for a few minutes. Toast the new year. All right. That would be nice. No invite for me, I see. HILARY: I can't. (ELLIS GRUNTS) Stop. Why? Who's this hurting? Well, your wife, for one. She has no idea. Doesn't mean it's right. Brenda doesn't know me anymore. We've been sleeping in different rooms since the summer. She won't even make me a cup of tea. You're the most wonderful person. You're so helpful. I feel such tenderness towards you. Your arse feels so good in my hands. (ELLIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (ELLIS MOANS) Here's to 1981. God, lovely stuff, that. Glenfiddich. HILARY: Mmm. So, any New Year's resolutions? No, not really. Um, try to eat a bit better, maybe. I was thinking perhaps I'd... I'd like to expand this place a bit. Put it on the map. Can I let you in on a secret? You mustn't tell anyone. What? It looks like we might be getting a big South Coast premiere. Mayor, councilors... Herald, the lot. Gosh. Well, that would be wonderful. ELLIS: Oh, I know. Chariots of Fire. That's the film. It was between us and the Odeon, but they didn't want a circuit cinema. So, it looks like we've got the nod. So, we'll have to spruce the place up a bit. Who knows? Might be the beginning of an exciting new chapter. (CAR HONKING IN DISTANCE) (KNOCKS AT DOOR) Jesus! Hello? It's me, Stephen. (CAR HORN BLARING) Come in. I was just leaving. I wanted to apologize for earlier. Oh, really, it's fine. I'm sorry I shouted. Why didn't you go with Janine? I did, for a bit. But I don't know any of her mates, and people, you know, staring. So... How awful to feel watched. Yeah, sometimes. Anyway, I thought you might want company. On the roof. Oh, I'd almost forgotten about that. Yeah, okay. Why not? (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (STEPHEN GASPS) STEPHEN: Oh, wow. This is so cool. (CHUCKLES) Look at that. If I had some binoculars I could almost see my mum. Is that where you live? Yeah. (CORK POPS) (DRINK POURING) Do you always come up here on New Year's Eve? Last couple of years. I don't blame you. Here. Not exactly Moet, but it's better than Tizer. Thank you. I'm sorry it's just us. No, this is nice. I'm not really a fan of New Year's Eve, anyway. Last year, I puked on my new shoes. Oh, no! What happened to them? (CHUCKLES) They survived. (HILARY LAUGHS) Cheers. Cheers. Oh, come on! Get it down ya! Oh, no. I shouldn't. I've had too much already. Really? When? Come on. What are you, a woman or a wouse? What's that? 9 to 5. You know, 9 to 5, the film we're showing. (WHISPERS) Oh. Honestly, anyone would think you worked in a bank, Hilary. Why don't you sneak in and watch? Oh, no, no, that's for the customers. And it gets so busy out front, there's always so much to do. Oh, God, listen to me, I'm so boring. Honestly. (LAUGHS) (BELLS TOLLING IN DISTANCE) Oh, listen. (BELLS CONTINUE TOLLING) "Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky... "the flying cloud and the frosty light. "The year is dying in the night. "Ring out, wild bells, and let him die." Nice. Tennyson. PEOPLE: (IN DISTANCE) Ten, nine. HILARY: Eight. (ALONG WITH PEOPLE) Seven, six... five, four... three, two, one! PEOPLE: Happy New Year! Happy New Year! (PEOPLE CHEERING) (FIREWORKS BURSTING) (FIREWORKS CONTINUE BURSTING) Shit. Hilary, it's all right! (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (IMPERCEPTIBLE) (IMPERCEPTIBLE) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (IMPERCEPTIBLE) Why not? Because it's pointless. They turned me down the first time. To study what? Architecture. Oh, that would be wonderful! Yeah. You have to try again. Yeah, maybe. Well, you can't just give up. Stephen? Don't let them tell you what you can or can't do. No one's gonna give you the life you want. You have to go out and get it. You can't stay here. All right. MAN: Oi! Oi! Where you from? MAN 2: Where you goin', son? MAN 1: Well, they have fuckin' bananas where you come from, did they? Why don't you fuck off back home where you came from, yeah? You fuckin' chimp. Yeah, go home, fuckin' coon. We don't like wogs 'round here. Taking our jobs. Go, then. Fuck off! (MEN LAUGHING AND JEERING) (MEN HOOTING MOCKINGLY) MAN 2: Go home, fucking coon. NORMAN: I told management months ago. There should be a no-smoking rule in both auditoria. Smoke compromises the viewing experience. Ruins the projected image, and it stains the screen. Simple common sense. All I'm saying is you need a basic understanding of optical and mechanical principles. to be in this game. Like I keep telling Ellis, any old numpty could sell tickets. ELLIS: Morning. Morning, Mr. Ellis. Morning, Norman. Morning, all. Hilary, can you pop in for a minute? Nope. I'm sorry? No, I can't. I'm running late. I need to open up. Suit yourself. I was going to ask you to work late tonight. Brenda and I have an engagement. So, I'll need to be gone by 5:00. Sorry. STEPHEN: Screen Two. Go on upstairs. Enjoy the film. Hello. I think our little friend might need a visit. It'll cheer him up. (SEAGULLS CALLING) STEPHEN: Nearly ready. Open the window. (PIGEON COOING) Look at that. Good as new. Amazing. Yeah. Time to say goodbye. Bye. (HILARY GASPS SOFTLY) STEPHEN: There he goes. To be able to fly. Yeah. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) STEPHEN: Trinidad, originally. They brought my mum over in the '60s to train as a nurse. Apparently, they needed more workers. "Help rebuild the mother country, "make your fortune." (CHUCKLES) She's still here, still a nurse. That explains the pigeon splint. (STEPHEN CHUCKLES) You got me. And here was me thinking you were Jesus. (BOTH CHUCKLE) What about your dad? He was a bus driver. But he left years ago. Where to? I dunno. Gosh. How did you feel? Fine. It's always been just me and my mum. She's the best. Wish I could say the same for mine. Was that... you know? Was it okay? Yeah. It was more than okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Shit. What time is it? NEIL: Where have you been? Ellis left 20 minutes ago, he said you were covering. I'm so sorry, Neil. I've had to keep them all waiting outside! And where's Stephen? I don't know. Is he not here? STEPHEN: Sorry! HILARY: So sorry! Thank you very much. Sorry to keep you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Hello, there. Sorry to keep you.

You could eat a few and then give the rest to me. I like a chip. (GULPING) Happy now? So sorry. Sorry, Stephen, he's always a bit of a handful. He's a dickhead. You okay? Stephen? Stephen? Stephen? (HORN BLARES) It's no point walking out. There's every fuckin' point. He's just an angry man. He's always angry about something. Look, Hilary, I know you're trying to help, but you're just makin' it worse. How am I making it worse? By pretending it isn't there. I really don't know what you're talking about. All right, put it this way. He's not just "angry," is he? And he should be the one to leave. Not me. You're absolutely right, Stephen. I'm sorry. Really. Okay, this might be the moment to demonstrate my greatest talent. HILARY: Does it happen a lot? Yeah, more than it used to. Especially the last few months. Really? Well, yeah. It's everywhere, isn't it? Is it? Yes, it is. All that stuff in Brixton. And the skinheads. And Thatcher. And those kids in New Cross. What was New Cross? Couple of weeks ago, at this girl's 16th birthday party someone started a fire. No one came for them. You should read the newspapers, Hilary. It's not goin' away. Told you, you need to hold it sideways. Yeah, not bad. Still some training needed. Look, watch this. Okay? (HILARY CHUCKLES) I lied. I'm shit at it. (CHUCKLES) Kiss me. No one's looking. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Four canisters at a time, 'cause they're not light. And lift 'em carefully. Precious cargo. (NORMAN GRUNTS) Put 'em down there. Tea? Please. You can go in if you want. (SPOON CLANKING SOFTLY) (SPOON CLATTERS) These are my babies. Pair of model 18 Kalees. I had no idea they'd be so big. Well, that's just as it should be. You don't want people to know. They should just see a beam of light. But back here... it's belts, straps, pulleys, intermittents... sprockets. Complex machinery. And what's this? That's the carbons. Spark between the carbons makes the light. And nothing happens without light. Ciggy? No, thanks. Amazin'. It is amazing. Because it's just static frames, with darkness in between. But there's a little flaw in your optic nerve so that if I run the film at 24 frames per second, you don't see the darkness. (CHUCKLES) Wow. It's called the Phi Phenomenon. Viewing static images rapidly in succession creates an illusion of motion. Illusion of life. ELLIS: So, on top of the lobby needing a lick of paint and all the rest, we're going to need special signage, a red carpet, crash barriers for the crowds. And I believe the mayor's office will provide some security. Jim? Yes, yes, indeed. There will be a small security detail. And you can expect the mayor, of course and his entourage, which is not insubstantial. And we're waiting for confirmation, but guests look to include Dora Bryan, Sir Laurence Olivier, Steve Ovett, Dame Flora Robson, Dusty Springfield and possibly, Paul McCartney. (HILARY GASPS SOFTLY) Goodness. Mmm. Yes, I know. Lives in Rye. Hmm. Two pounds down since last time. Well done. Well, I've been trying to take a bit more exercise, eating better, you know. And the lithium? How's that? Good. Last time you said that it made you feel a little out of sorts. Yes, it's much better now. I think my system must be getting used to it. Really? Yeah, much better. Excellent. (HILARY HUMMING) (DO NOTHING BY THE SPECIALS PLAYING) What're you doing? No one's watchin' you! Shut up, look the other way. Why? I've seen it all. Don't be vulgar. It's different in the throes of passion. Well, I can't be bothered. I am going... What're you doing? (GASPS) (STEPHEN LAUGHS) HILARY: No! (LAUGHS) STEPHEN: Charge! (LAUGHING) (HILARY GASPS, LAUGHS) (DO NOTHING CONTINUES PLAYING) (SEAGULLS CALLING) HILARY: Where did you meet her? STEPHEN: She was one of the nurses on my mum's ward. HILARY: She your first serious girlfriend? Yeah. Broke my heart. Cried for a week. I still can't go near the hospital without getting butterflies. Goodness. Yeah, I just couldn't stop thinkin' about her, you know? What about you? Oh, nothing as grand as that. There must have been someone. Hilary? Mind your own business. Okay. That one's different to the others. I wasn't aware I was working under instruction. I'm just saying. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Why you doing that? You're spoilin' it. I am not working under instruction. All right, fine. Do what you want. I shall. Thank you. God, you men, you always have to help us. Always have to instruct us. Don't be silly. Got your hands around our fucking throats and you won't let go. (ANGRILY) Got your hands around our fucking necks and we can't breathe. But you won't let go, will you? You won't fucking well let go! Why don't you just... Hilary! ...fucking let go? Stop. What're you doin'? (PANTING) You won't fucking well let go, will you? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) Are you sure you'll be okay getting home? Yeah. You? Oh, I'll be fine. I'm in early tomorrow to open up. Maybe see you then? (HILARY BREATHING HEAVILY) (SEAGULLS CALLING) NEIL: Morning. Morning. Listen... Hilary, I know it's none of my business, but perhaps it might be better to leave your personal life at home. What? Rather than upstairs, in the, you know... in the pigeon coop. I don't know what you mean. Oh, come on. Look, be careful. Hils, remember what happened before. Just look after yourself. I don't know how he knew, he just knew. I think he might have seen us coming downstairs together the other day. It's fine. We just need to be more discreet. Perhaps just meet outside of work? Look, maybe it's not a good idea. What do you mean? Well, this. The whole thing. Why? Well, once people know it, it's different. Really? Yeah, it's just... It feels different. You're embarrassed. No, I'm not. And that's not, that's not what I'm saying. Yes, you are, you're embarrassed. I just don't... Of course you are. It's silly. It's ridiculous. What were we thinking? I'm not embarrassed, Hilary. I just don't think we can do this. No, you're absolutely right. I'll see you soon. (KISSES) (SIGHS) (BOLT UNLATCHES) (SOBBING) (OLD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) Have either of you two seen the keys to the utility cupboard? Oh, I dunno. I think Hilary had them. Oh. There you go. Thanks. NEIL: You heard from Hilary? No. It's been three days. She told Mr. Ellis she was taking some overdue holiday. I'm sure it's all fine. So why am I worried? She had a rough time last year. She had to go away for a while in the summer. Why? I think things just got a bit much for her. She ended up being rude to a couple of the customers. Shouting at them. She was staying later and later at work. Said she couldn't sleep. And started doing weird... things. Eventually, Ellis told us she had to go into hospital. She was away for a few weeks and when she got back she was different. How? Just quieter. A bit sad. Did you speak to her about it? She didn't wanna talk.

I taught him everything he knows. Hello! Darling! (APPLAUSE) ELLIS: My worshipful Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress, Councilor Rushworth, Councilor Booth. My lords, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. My name is Donald Ellis. I am the manager of the Empire Cinema, perhaps the South Coast's premier film venue. It is a great honor... perhaps the greatest of my career to welcome you to this, the regional gala premiere of Chariots of Fire. (APPLAUSE) Uh, there are a few people I need to thank. Uh, the mayor's office, obviously. (WHISPERS) Where's the mayor? ELLIS: And in particular, Jim Booth for his help... (WHISPERS) There. Next to Ellis' wife. (MOUTHING) ELLIS: ...and his sage advice. And all the staff here. Uh, Hilary's here. ELLIS: At the Empire, for their hard work and dedication. What? Where? ELLIS: And lastly... Somewhere in the building. ELLIS: ...my wife, Brenda... Is she all right? ELLIS: ...whose unstinted support and love... I'm not sure. ...have been unwavering. And so, without further ado... I am delighted to welcome you to Hugh Hudson's stirring and altogether terrific... Chariots of Fire. (APPLAUSE) ELLIS: What're you doing? Oh, no. (APPLAUSE) Good evening, my lords, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Mayor. My name is Hilary Small. I am duty manager here at the Empire. And as such, I thought I'd add a few words of welcome. Tonight is a special night. More than ever, we need to be... We need to feel part of a community. Black or white, it doesn't matter. It's a very important thing. We must celebrate. (MIC FEEDBACK WHINES) So, to mark the occasion, I'd like to read a poem I think would be appropriate. It's by W. H. Auden. "The desires of the heart are as crooked as corkscrews. "Not to be born is the best for man... "the second best is a formal order... "the dance's pattern. "Dance while you can. "Dance, dance, for the figure is easy... "the tune is catching and will not stop. "Dance till the stars come down from the rafters. "Dance, dance, dance till you drop." Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Hilary! What the hell do you think you're doing? You were not invited to speak. Well, it can't be all men droning on. You knew what this evening meant to me, Hilary. You more than anyone. And yet you willfully tried to ruin it. Well, I'm terribly sorry, but you can't always have it your own way! Well, you've got a problem. You know that? You need serious help. Now, we've all tried to help you here, but at some point you need ...to take responsibility for your own... And why don't you go and fuck yourself! Donald? What're you doing? Why aren't you inside? The film's started. Oh, hello, Brenda. I've been wanting to meet. I think about you daily. BRENDA: I don't understand. Well, so many questions for a start. And so many notes to compare. I'm still unclear. Mostly about your husband's sexual tastes. Hilary, for God's sake. What do you mean? ELLIS: Brenda, this is nonsense. Don't listen to a word she says. "To fuck or not to fuck, that is the question. "Whether 'tis nobler in the minds "to wank him off into his teacup, "or let him fuck me over his desk "and spoil all his paperwork?" Is this true? Donald, is this true? NEIL: Yes. Yes, it's true. (NORMAN SIGHS) Well, first reel's goin' off beautifully. What the hell are you doing? Telling the truth. What a novel idea! That's not the truth. I'll tell you the truth. You're a schizophrenic. You're a fucking nutter! And the only reason you're working here is because I told the social workers I'd keep an eye on you. You're unemployable. If you want to find the condoms, they are in the top left-hand drawer of his desk, next to the Murray Mints. Right, so, what're we gonna do? Well, Ellis says he doesn't want her back at work. Apparently, she'd already threatened to smash all his windows with a golf club. What? Is that really true? I wouldn't put it past her. He's called the social services. They'll probably take her back into hospital. Well, how come he gets away with it? It just seems so unfair. Look, she's probably better off in St. Jude's. How can she be better off in a mental hospital? They know how to deal with it. No. What are you doing? Well, I'm going to see her. I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not sure how much help you can be. Well, I can't just turn my back on her. Leave her on her own. I can't. Hilary! (SEAGULLS CALLING IN DISTANCE) (DOORBELL BUZZING) (DOOR BUZZES OPEN) What do you want? I'm worried about you. Well, that's terribly sweet, but I don't need your concern. I thought you might want company, someone to talk to. I'm absolutely fine! Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you people? All right, all right. But I just need to say this. What you're going through is a medical condition, it's an illness. And I wanted to make sure that you understand that it's not your fault. (LAUGHING) Did you take a guide book out of the library for me? Oh, dear. What's so funny? You don't have to try so hard. (LAUGHS, KISSES) Just pour me a glass of wine. (THE WIND BY CAT STEVENS PLAYING SOFTLY) HILARY: And they said, "No, you can't go in there. "You're not allowed." So, I sat there like a good little girl with my schoolbag at my feet. And I waited. And I knew it as soon as my father stepped into the room, I could smell the sex on them. Such a fucking cliche! Sex with the secretary. I think my mother knew. She kept asking me but I told her nothing. Why not? Because I was loyal to him. I've no idea why. And then she started punishing me. She blamed me for my father withdrawing his affections. Because I was "daddy's little girl." And when I had my first period, she brought the bedsheets to the breakfast table. And said, "Look what your precious "little girl just did!" Jesus. I used to sit in the back of the car on the way to school and I'd look at the back of her neck. I'd just stare at it and think all I have to do is just put my hands round there and just squeeze! (LAUGHS) Look at your little face! You think I'm mad, don't you? But I am absolutely sane. This has all been planned. I've been lying in wait for them all this time. All these people, all these men, they will have their comeuppance, just you see! You have had your day, Mr. Donald Ellis! Professor Raymond Pattenden, how dare you give me a low second, you corrupt little shit! Dr. Ian Laird, you are a fucking fraud! And I shall report you to the highest medical authority in the land! You are finished! I will finish you! Because I'm the only one who knows the truth, do you understand me? I'm the only one! (KNOCK ON DOOR) (MORNING HAS BROKEN BY CAT STEVENS PLAYS) BRAMAH: Hello? Miss Small? Quick, turn the lights off. (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS) Don't speak. Don't make a sound. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) BRAMAH: Miss Small? It's Constable Bramah from the Kent Police again. We've got social services with us. Could you let us in, please? (WHISPERS) Just ignore them. Bastards. BRAMAH: Miss Small? We've received further complaints from other tenants in the building about loud music and a general disturbance. There's also reports from Mrs. Van Dyck in Flat Seven that you've made several very serious verbal and physical threats towards her. (WHISPERS) Bitch. BRAMAH: I'm gonna need you to open this door, please. (WHISPERS) Just stay quiet. They'll go away. ROSEMARY: Miss Small? Hilary? It's Rosemary Bates here, Kent Social Services. We've met before. Hilary, could I come in, please? (WHISPERS) Go now. Out the back. What? Leave. Now. The fire escape. Why, Hilary? I just wanna help. You don't get it, do you? I don't want your fucking help! I am not your patient. I am not some problem to be solved. ROSEMARY: Hilary, I'm afraid if you don't open the door, we are going to have to force entry. Go now. (ANGRILY) Do I make myself clear? Do I? Yes. Good. Then fuck off. (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) Shit. ROSEMARY: Hilary, please open the door. (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) Oh, for goodness sake! Just go in there and close the door. (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) ROSEMARY: Hilary, please open the door. (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) Hilary, we're asking you one last time. Please, open the door. (MORNING HAS BROKEN BY CAT STEVENS CONTINUES) (DOOR THUDS LOUDLY) (SONG ENDS) May we come in? Hello, Hilary. It looks like things have got a little bit out of hand again. Is that right? You're all packed? That's good. A good few days' sleep and you'll be feeling much better. We've got a first floor room all nice and ready for you. This one's got a view of the garden. (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) And two girls. Romping through the desert, splashing into the ocean. Listen for the reel end bell. (BELL RINGING) Open the dowser. Here comes the first blob. And do motor cue. After the water, we go on the sand. Here comes second blob. California, here I come! Go! Yes! (LAUGHS) NORMAN: Excellent. (CHUCKLES) Now, get that one off, lace up reel three. And don't dick about. Stephen, can you do the inventory and then you can clock off early? Yeah, of course. Great. (THUNDER RUMBLING) REPORTER: (ON TV) More than a hundred white and colored youths fought a pitched battle against the police. Some were as young as 12, the oldest no more than 20. It lasted for eight hours. And at the end of it, Merseyside's chief constable said it was a planned attack. "We were set up," he said. The worst of the rioting came just after dawn when police faced a hail of stones, bottles, iron bars... I'm feeling very hot with answers like that. And now, I gave a very respectable one. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING ON TV) That'd be one pound ten, please. Thank you. Stephen? Ruby. Wow. Hi. Hi. I didn't know you worked here. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, five months now. I thought you wanted to go to university. Yeah, well, I tried. Still trying. I'm not at the hospital anymore. Your mum probably told you. No, she didn't say anything. (WHISPERS) It was the hours. (LAUGHS) Those early mornings. I don't know how they do it. Yeah, I know. Uh, so, what do you do now? Well, for the time bein' I'm working at that bar on the front. Boodles. Mmm. It's fun. You should pop in. Maybe have a drink. Yeah. Might do that. And in the meantime, a box of Maltesers, please. (CHUCKLING) Oh. Right, yeah, of course. Twenty P. Thank you. Uh, enjoy Stir Crazy. It's brilliant. Thanks. See you soon, then? Yeah, see you soon. (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (RUBY GIGGLING) STEPHEN: It's fine. Like this. Okay? (MELLOW MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (RUBY LAUGHING) Did it. (BOTH LAUGHING) RUBY: So, what're you gonna do? STEPHEN: I don't know. Maybe stay here, keep working at the Empire. Help Norman out. Who? Oh, the projectionist. He is funny. And you know what? I like it up there... once you get over the smell. (LAUGHING) Yeah, that's cool. All those movies for free. Well, you don't really get to watch any of them. Why not? What is it? STEPHEN: Nothing. Someone I know. RUBY: Do you want to say hello? No, it's fine. (STEPHEN SIGHS) You okay? Stevie? What? Yeah, I'm fine. You know what? I do feel a bit... I think I should go back and say hello. Um, okay. I'll be quick. Hilary. Hello. How're you? I'm good. So, you're back. Yes. Out and about again. That's good. It's great to see you. We've missed you. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure that's not true. You should drop by and say hello to everyone. Mr. Ellis has left. He moved to Brighton. Yes, Neil told me. He called me and asked me back. Wow. That's brilliant. Hello. Hi. Hilary, this is Ruby. Ruby, this is Hilary who I know from work. So, hopefully, see you soon? Yes. Thank you. Thanks. (COINS CLATTER) Thank you. STEPHEN: Hilary? Hilary? Hilary, are you all right? Stephen. Tell me truthfully, did I humiliate myself? What? Tell me. Did I? (SIGHS) No. It wasn't humiliating. It was just... intense. To be honest, I thought you were a bit of a hero. (CHUCKLING) That's very nice of you. Hard to believe. My dad used to take me fishing when I was little. We never caught any fish. And for years, I just thought he was a bad fisherman. And then, I realized it was something else. Something quite simple. He didn't know where the fish were. And he was too ashamed to ask. He was just ashamed. Shame is not a healthy condition. You should try to forget about it. Go in there more often. No, I can't. It's my job. Yeah, you tear the tickets. Make sure they're all in their seats. But you never go in. You should watch once in a while. Yeah, sit in the middle of a bunch of people who don't know you, who've never met you, who can't even see you. (SIGHS) That little beam of light is escape. I've missed you. Come on. We've got a little surprise for you. (ALL CHEERING) Thank goodness you're here because I need some of this cake! (ALL CHEERING) Ta-da! JANINE: Safeway's finest! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) EMPLOYEE: That one. (SPELLBOUND BY SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES PLAYS ON SPEAKER) Janine, I've gotta admit. This song is growin' on me. Yeah, it's good. (RUMBLING IN DISTANCE) What's that? STEPHEN: You played it for me. U.S. Spin magazine. You hear that? Janine, can you turn that down some? (LOWERS VOLUME) What's that noise? (ENGINES REVVING OUTSIDE) Wow! Look at that. RIOTER: Leave our jobs alone! Come on, skinheads! RIOTER 2: Leave our jobs alone! Colored scum! Off our streets! Okay, right, lock the doors. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (LATCHES LOCKING) RIOTER: White is right! (RIOTERS CONTINUE SHOUTING) (LAUGHING) Hello, princess. What we doing? Look who it is, boys! Let me in! (RIOTERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, my God! (SHOUTING CONTINUES) Hello, princess! Where you fucking going? Come on, you fuckin' wog! Come on then, you bunch of fucking cowards. RIOTER: What did you fuckin' say? Huh? Look at you, you can't do anything on your own. I ain't a coward, you fuckin' spade! Use your imagination, you fucking coward! (STEPHEN GROANS) (TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (IMPERCEPTIBLE) No! Stop it! (SHOUTING CONTINUES) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) RIOTER: Get off of me! What the fuck? Get the fuck off of me! (CRYING) (SIREN BLARING) (STEPHEN BREATHING HEAVILY) You're going to be all right. You're strong. (GASPS SOFTLY) DOCTOR: What's happened? PARAMEDIC: He's had a kicking. GCS had dropped to six, and he just lost consciousness. DOCTOR: Coming through. Excuse me, please! PARAMEDIC: Respiration's at 35 per minute. DOCTOR: Move, please! Let's get him straight into resus. Are you next of kin? No, he's my friend, I work with him. Next of kin only past this point. But will he be all right? If you wanna wait here, we'll let you know. DELIA: Excuse me. Are you waiting for news of Stephen? Yes. He's going to be all right. (SIGHS) Thank God. Badly bruised all over. And he's lost a couple of teeth... but he's conscious. And he wanted you to know that he was okay. Oh, that's... Thank you. I'm so sorry. Yes. It's a bad situation. Anyway, you can go home now. You must've been waiting here for hours. Yeah. I'll just get my things. Are you the one that he went to the beach with? Yes. Yes, we did go to the beach. (SIGHS) (SHOWER RUNNING) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) Now the time is almost six-and-a-half minutes past 12 and BBC One is closing down. So, from all of us here, this is Henry Brooks wishing you a very good night. I have to say, I miss our young friend. I was getting used to having someone to help me with all this. Hmm. You been to visit him? Couple of weeks ago. Not since? No. Go and see him. Don't run away. Is that what I'm doing? Seems like it. What're you frightened of, Hilary? (SIGHS) I've got a son. Christopher. He's 22 now. Lives in London. I haven't seen him since he was eight. What? Doesn't want to see me. I don't blame him. Basically, I ran away. Why? What? Why? (LAUGHING) I can't remember. (CHUCKLES) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Hi. Can I go to ward one? Thank you. Thank you. A couple of cracked ribs. So, it's a bit sore when I laugh. But the swelling's gone down. My eyesight's okay. So... I'm so sorry, Stephen. I don't know what to say. There's nothing to say. It's happened to my mum, it's happened to me, it'll probably happen to my children. Sometimes I think... what's the fucking point? Here. I got you something. It just came out. I thought you might like it. Oh, my God. The chap in the shop gave me a funny look. But then, I suppose, I don't look much like a "Rude Girl." (LAUGHS, GROANS) Sorry. (GROANS) That's so nice of you. I didn't really get what was so special about it all before. But, Black kids and white kids meeting up together makes it all normal. Yeah. Good music, too. DELIA: Hello. It's okay, you don't need to leave. I'm just doing last check-ups. Oh, no, I should go. I've got stuff to do, and it's getting late. I don't want to be a bother. Bye, then. Bye, Hilary. Thanks for coming. Bye. Hilary. Look, Hilary, I don't know what's gone on between you two... and I don't really want to. But you should know that he was askin' after you. He likes you. You cheer him up. So... (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Empire Cinema on the front, please. (ENGINE STARTS) Show me a film. What? Show me a film. I want to see a film. What film? Any film. You choose. (REEL WHIRRING) (INAUDIBLE) (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) CHANCE: I see. That's a very small room. WILSON: (CHUCKLES) Yes, sir. I guess that's true. Smallest room in the house. CHANCE: Yes, I guess that's true. I feel very good in here. RAND: (LAUGHS) That's the oxygen. CHANCE: As long as the roots are not severed, all is well. And all will be well in the garden. (CRYING SOFTLY) PRESIDENT "BOBBY": Life... is a state of mind. (SNIFFLES) (SWITCH CLICKS) It was just wonderful. I can't wait to see it again. Yeah. Peter Sellers is the funniest. You should see him in Return of the Pink Panther. (MIMICS INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU) "I did not know "the bank was being robbed." Hilarious. I can't wait. And there are so many others. I'm gonna need you to make me a list. Of course... Look... I was thinking we could make it a weekly thing, midnight screenings. I'm sure we could persuade Norman... I've got a place at college. I'm going to college. I got a letter two weeks ago. A place opened up. Well, that's wonderful! Where? Bristol. Architecture. You did it. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) You told me not to give up. Well, Stephen, congratulations. You deserve it. (SIGHS) When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Ah. (DOOR OPENS) What did you get? New shoes. Mmm-hmm. And those books for the course. That's great. Did you tell her? Yeah. Was she okay? Yeah. No. I don't know. (SIGHS) Well... As long as you were kind. Now, Ruby is comin' for your goodbye dinner. What are we gonna make her? (ALL LAUGHING) No, no, no. Don't break the glass, Stevie. Those are the good ones. All right, Mum. Calm down. I'll be gone tomorrow. So here's to the future. Aw. (CHUCKLES) And to good music. RUBY: Mmm. And to getting back up. And here's to Richard Pryor and John Belushi... and Mars Bars... and sandcastles... and my new suede shoes. DELIA: Mmm. And here's to going away. And coming home. And now I need to pee. (RUBY LAUGHING) God, Mrs. Murray. He's so different from before. Mmm-hmm. He's lived a little bit of life, I think. (CLICKS TONGUE) A little bit of life. HILARY: Here. Read it later. Thanks, Hilary. You're going to have a wonderful time. But I am going to miss you. Yeah. I'll miss you, too. Okay. Off you go. Okay. So, I'll see you in the holidays maybe. Yeah. That'd be lovely. Okay... Bye. Bye. Stephen! (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (CONDUCTOR BLOWS WHISTLE) HILARY: "The trees are coming into leaf "like something almost being said. "The recent buds relax and spread. "Their greenness is a kind of grief. "Is it that they are born again "and we grow old? "No, they die, too. "Their yearly trick of looking new "is written down in rings of grain. "Yet still the un-resting castles thresh... "In full-grown thickness every May. "Last year is dead, they seem to say. "Begin afresh... "afresh... "afresh." (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)
