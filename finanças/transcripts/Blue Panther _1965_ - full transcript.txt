PAINTER: IT WEARS, SIR, AS IT GROWS. POET: AY, THAT'S WELL KNOWN: BUT WHAT PARTICULAR RARITY? WHAT STRANGE, WHICH MANIFOLD RECORD NOT MATCHES? JEWELLER: I HAVE A JEWEL HERE... SHAKESPEARE (TIMON OF ATHENS) You Pig! Pick a card, any card. Stop bugging me, I need to think. Just pick a card, you jerk. Don't show it. You know you're a pain in the rear? Put it in the deck. You remind me of that guy who wouldn't stop singing. I shuffle... What did your guy do? He got into the Op√©ra de Marseille. Cut. He must have been happy. Are you nuts? They made him carry halberds. He didn't sing. Look. I make three piles. So, what did he do? One day, he ran the halberd through the tenor. Pick one of the three piles. This one. Here's your card. - Is this the one? - Shit. I don't remember. Asshole. Let's go eat. Yes, that would be best. Third service! Third service! Third service. Third service! One person, sir? A dear. You want deer? No, I'm saying Antoine is a dear. May I? Ma'am, sir? Please do. - Veal roast. - Excuse me? Welcome. - Creamed potatoes? - Creamed potatoes. Allow me to introduce myself: Bruno Kerrien, advertising agent. Hubert de Ronsac. Mixed vegetables, ma'am. Could you ask the gentleman what the main course is, my dear? Veal roast and creamed potatoes, ma'am. My cousin Marie-Chantal, as good as she is beautiful and as intelligent as she is good. Thank you. He always told me I was a pest. She is a pest, but deep down, she's a good person. So, I'm a good pest. There's something strange in the vegetables, I swear. No, thank you. And where are you traveling to, Mr. Kerrien? By some strange coincidence, the same place you're going. Why do you think so? This envelope from Hotel des Neiges in Verbois suggests you're going there. I'm going to Verbois, to the Hotel des Neiges. He's Sherlock Holmes. Mixed vegetables, ma'am? Sir? No. - Mixed vegetables, sir? - Just a tad. I'm surprised you chose that winter resort. We're going there for detox treatment. Really? My cousin never wanted to learn the true meaning of words. I'm dragging him there, actually. - Megeve might have been better. - Tell me about it! But when Marie-Chantal has something in mind... Switzerland! Can you imagine? - What are we going to do? - Ski! When I go to a winter resort, I ski. She's crazy. What about you? No. I mean, are you going skiing? No, it's a business trip. Are you athletic? Very athletic. Abominably athletic. All sports. All she talks about is sports. Sports. These are strange mashed potatoes. Honestly, they taste like mixed vegetables. That's what they are. I'm exhausted, I'm going to bed. Right, go to bed. I'm sure you won't try to keep me. My cousin is such a fascinating being. Stop being silly and leave. My darling, I must warn you that during the whole meal, a handsome man has been watching you two tables behind us, on your right. Take care of the bill, honey. Good night, sir. And long live Switzerland! Good night. Did you spot him? Who? The Englishman? Why English? Only an Englishman would look like that. Major in the Indian Army type, little mustache, stern look... A scar on his ear? Yes, how did you guess? Small, a ruddy complexion, a crew cut? Yes. Sounds like you know him. I know an American just like that. Really? Cheese, sir? No, thank you. No, thank you. Jam? - Excuse me? - Jam? Cheese, jam, veggies, are you almost done? Almost, sir. Wafers. No, thank you. You look worried. It's nothing. Just thinking my wife might be unable to join me. What's troubling you? Her coming or her not coming? She was in a serious car accident, recently. I'm sorry. - You have no luck with men. - None. - Salt, please. - In retrospect... Miss... I need to ask you for a favor. A favor? How awful! Salt! I need your help and I can't tell you why. But you have to help me. I'm carrying an object. A piece of jewelry. A piece of jewelry? Yes. A blue panther with ruby eyes. Big rubies? Salt, salt! We asked for salt! You have to agree to take this jewel and hide it on your person. Until tomorrow or the day after. Give it back in Verbois, when I ask you for it. It's a matter of life or death for me. Will you do it? Are you a thief? No, I can't explain anything. Will you do it? - Fruit, ma'am? - Yes. Fruit, sir? An apple, a pear, a pineapple, three bananas and a coconut! I don't mind taking it, but I mind hiding it if it's beautiful. Nobody should know you have it. What if I kept it? Are you a thief? No. Where is it? I'll offer you a cigarette. Take the Panther in the cigarette case. My lighter won't work, you'll open your purse to get yours. That's when you'll slip the Panther in your purse. Back in your compartment, hide it on your person for extra safety. Where? On your person. What if they search me at customs? The odds of that are one in 10,000. Ready? Wait, I don't have a lighter. Don't you have matches? Yes, pretty ones. Perfect. What brand of cigarettes? Gauloises. You okay with that? Oh, Well. Let's pay and leave. - On one bill? - Yes, please. - 7760 francs. - 7760 francs?! - Yes. - On, boy. Thank you, sir. I'll walk you to your compartment, for safety. I don't want to be watched over all night long. Here it is. Marie-Chantal... Don't open the door to anybody. Be very cautious. - Even to you? - Nobody. Stay cautious all night long. I love it. Good night. Good night. The hunt for Dr. Kha is a particularly dangerous one. Dangerous for you, or for me? Time will tell. Good night. This is unbearable! You're crazy for bringing us here! You'd take a spill anywhere else as well. Possibly, but there's hardly anyone here and no one we know. Glasses. Great, I think I broke my ankle. And my masquerade ball is next week. The cigarette lighter! That must be your specialty. Just a stroke of luck. A very useful one. Thrilled. Delighted. Do we know each other? I don't think so. Castillo. Hubert de Ronsac. We really don't know anyone here. Your friend from the train isn't with you? What friend? We haven't seen him since yesterday. Ah, the adman. He's in advertising? Yes. And what are you in, as you put it? Journalism. I'm a reporter. How wonderful! My dream! Seeing, reporting! - For Paris Match? Time? - No, no. Ah, freelance. I have wonderful friends at Match. And you vacation here? You're all crazy. Don't worry, I'm not on vacation, I'm here for business. A robbery? Why would you think that? No, much better. I'm working on a case of international espionage. Oh, wow! International espionage... Double Scotch. Johnnie Walker, Ballantine's, Chivas? Ham-. Don't you think the sky is of a particularly moving blue today? Truly, it has more charm and sparkle than ever. Did you spot the doctor? No. He's not here. He's supposed to have the object delivered here. He could send someone. And you think Kerrien could be that someone? Kerrien, the guy from Bamako? Impossible, he's on the other side. I see you're not up to speed. Did you read the paper? No. Dumont was murdered on the train yesterday. What?! I thought you did it. Another double. I need to think. Okay, that's $300. You're not blowing your nose with your fingers, brother. Never. Don't be a miser, Mr. Johnson. Three glasses of Pendant. Right away, sir. At the end of the counter, please. - At the end of the counter? - Yes. I said don't be a miser, Mr. Johnson. Bruno Kerrien is in room 312. And beware of the Russian and the kid. Are they part of it too? Yes. They paid me to get information. And you gave them some? No, sir. I'm a patriot. Very good. Hello. Everything okay? Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I ran into trouble. I'll tell you later. After dinner, go to the nightclub under the hotel. Be like the other night. See you tonight. What a pleasure to see you! We're dying of boredom here. What did I do to him? Fendant is great as a pre-dinner and after-dinner wine. I produced 903 hectoliters of it in previous years. But don't think I drink it all myself. What would you like, gentlemen? Nothing for me. Apple juice for my Gregor. Grapefruit juice. Don't be in such a hurry. Something's bothering me. Earlier, you were talking to the attache of a capitalist embassy. No problem, it's part of your job as bartender. I can't tell them to take a hike. But you're playing both sides. That's the job I have a problem with. You're crazy. - Am I crazy, Gregor? - No, Dad. See? I'm not crazy. Don't you think the sky... What an amazing device. Is it American? Soviet. Still amazing. Is it expensive? It's free. Allow me to buy grapefruit juice for the cheating bartender. No, thank you. Yes, you should. It's harmless. It's no Fendant wine, but it's completely harmless. - No, I swear... - Drink it. What's with him? Fragile. WARNING - KEEP TIPS UP DEPARTURE - SIT DOWN THIS WAY About your spy story... Actually, I'm being mysterious to seduce you. Spies don't exist anymore. You haven't kept up. Gorillas, Barbouzes, James Bond... They're clowns! Are you looking for Dad? I think he's looking for you in your room. If you can't find him, he might be in Kerrien's room. - I think you got the wrong room. - I think you got the wrong room. - Yes, it's a mistake. - Yes. Same here. The mountain air is making me absent-minded. We have nothing to do here. I think the room is empty. Empty? How strange. Its occupant doesn't occupy it. Are you sure? - Absolutely. After you. - No, after you. I won't. Matter of precedence. Allow me to break the rule and let you go first. Cigarette? Cigarette. American? Soviet. - With pleasure. - Gladly. See you soon, sir. I hope to see you longer. Certainly, sir. Your conversation is delightful. What's that? A party, a revolution? No, non e rivoluzione. Thank goodness. Hey, your friend from the train. - Where? - There. Bruno! Is he deaf? Really, Bruno? Bruno! Let's meet at the bottom! Bruno, how was I dressed the other night? Bruno! Hey, you need to get off! Your ride is over, sir! Ferdinand, we have a freeloader! It's 9O cents for another ride, sir! Ferdinand, stop the lift! Look at this guy! I've never seen such a thing. Stop it! Stop it, Ferdinand! I'm telling you to stop it. He looks sick. Bruno! He fell! Go get a doctor! Come on, run! Dr. Kha... Watch out... Agadir... The Panther... Swear to give it only to Ali Kadour. Swear to me. Nobody else. Nobody. Souk... Ali Kadour... Swear... I swear. What is he saying? The eyes... The eyes... What's he saying? I don't know. I didn't understand. He said "the eyes." "The eyes..." I'm listening. We searched and emptied his whole room. Nothing. I offed him on the ski lift. No trace? No, no trace. Good. The girl probably has it. Should I do the same to her? No, since it failed. According to the report, she's an airhead. It won't be difficult. Despite your crazy demeanor, you do keep your cool. I just have good manners, so I hide my feelings. Come on, a friend of yours dies in your arms and you go dancing on the same night. Are you shocked? Maybe I just don't have a heart. You'll never make me believe that. Tell me, have you ever heard of the Blue Panther? The what? The Blue Panther. It's a jewel. A jewel? Where? That's what I'm asking you. I don't understand. Should I know? You could have known. Those Russians are real barbarians. It's almost midnight. Not the time or place for a child. What are we doing here? We're thinking. This is the perfect place for it. Wisdom comes out of the mouths of babes. Indeed. I would bet two pairs of shoes against a pack of gum that the doctor mentioned by Johnson to the bartender was the formidable Dr. Kha. Kha? Gregor... Don't be childish. Do you want to visit Eastern Siberia? Eastern Siberia or Dr. Kha, same thing. Gregor, what will we do? Take care of these three. - The three black guys? - Of course not. The little snob, her idiot cousin and the fake reporter. Gregor... I'm wondering why they didn't question us about Kerrien's death. He died of natural causes. Pulmonary embolism, per the doctor. What happened? Someone died? Someone is asking for you, miss. - Me? Who? - Someone! - Yes, miss. - Bring them here. Who could it be? It's Jacques! It's a lady, miss. She doesn't want to come in. It's Francoise! Hubert, calm down. It's unimaginable. Why can't she come in? She's in mourning. - In mourning... - Don't go. Of course I will. A grieving woman in a nightclub. Isn't it admirable? Miss? Ma'am. You don't know me, but I'm... Bruno Kerrien's widow. I'm so sorry to meet you in such circumstances. Your husband told me you were supposed to meet him. Yes, I know. He called me yesterday. Please forgive me, but this is all so sudden. So awful. I understand. And I'm really sorry you had to come down here because of me. You're very nice... But don't be sorry. Yesterday, Bruno told me he gave you the Blue Panther. The Panther? It's a rather cheap piece of jewelry, but I'm very attached to it. Would you give it to me? Tomorrow, I'm taking his body back to Paris in order to have him... buried. Jewelry? No, I don't have any piece of jewelry. Bruno didn't give you anything? I don't want to rush you or be pushy, but could you come to my room tomorrow morning? I won't insist, miss. Excuse me for interrupting your evening. I should have understood. But I'm so upset. See you tomorrow. Here she is. Why didn't you let us follow her? That idiot Johnson did it for us. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Are you coming? Sure. I'm dead on my feet. It's not your fault, but I've never been so bored in my life. What a wasteland. Maybe you can't see what's hiding behind things. Behind things? So, who was it? Not important. A friend of Mother's. Well, good night. My evening will be sad now. Good night. Be careful. I'm not careful, I'm crazy. She's crazy. Hello? Yes, send her up. Come in. Good morning, miss. I came here like you asked me to. I hope I'm not bothering you. I'm not too early? I'm sorry to make you go through all this trouble, but last night, I couldn't possibly... Well, you know how it is. Miss... I'm sorry to rush you, but I would like to catch the 11:30 train. Oh, right, you're in a hurry. Don't be mad at me, I'm crazy. Do you have side effects from your accident? No, thank you, it's all over now. Anyway, with what I'm going through now... What exactly happened? Just like any accident, stupidly. And the horse? Did they put it down? No, I asked them to spare it. The problem with the Panther is I know nothing about it. How so? It's the first time I hear about it. I don't understand. Impossible. I know you have it. I swear I don't, my dear. Give it to me. You can't do this to me. I have a third dan in judo, so I advise you not to move. I don't understand your story. Tell me who you are. Bitch! Come on, girl! But I don't know anything. Almost nothing. How I wish I didn't agree to this! Tell me everything, angel. - I'm not Kerrien's wife. - I figured. I don't even know him. It's because of Daddy. They have him. They've threatened to kill him if I don't do as they ask. Who's "they"? Intelligence Service. They threatened to torture and kill him if I didn't get it back. The Intelligence Service? Are they really that cruel? You have no idea. I beg of you. Give me the Panther. What is it to you? I really don't have it. They'll kill Daddy, then. No, just tell them I don't have it. They won't believe me. Of course they will, since it's the truth. Truth is an impregnable fortress. It's obvious. Will you let me go? Yes. Don't tell anyone about this. I beg of you. I won't say anything. You swear? Do you want me to spit on the floor? I am a woman of my word. Your purse. Thank you. I'm really sorry about your daddy. - Sir? - Do you have our tickets to Agadir? In a minute. The bellboy went to pick them up. - We're leaving in two hours! - You'll have them by then. You need to hurry! Don't play that, it's a disaster! So, you've been had. The bitch is clever. Much more than I thought. Who does she work for? I know as much as you do. And who do you work for? For myself. If you know what I mean. I thought you were bold, but you're reckless. Your name is Olga. You must have Slavic roots. Olga. Do you want to work for us? We pay very well, you know. I always longed for my homeland. You can't sever those ties. Let's look at the game. Ah, you lost. See you in Agadir? I'll be there. Gregor. Was it good? Perfect. What if the girl they call Marie-Chantal was sent by Dr. Kha? That's what I think. I told you not to think, Dad. Gregor. I just heard you were leaving for Agadir. Always up to date. Don't make fun of me. I was the last one to know. I think I've fallen a little bit in love with you. My goodness. What would you say if we went to Agadir? That would be divine. I got the tickets! - Hello! - Hello. They brought your luggage down. Is this dingy suitcase yours? No, it's mine. Darn, are you leaving too? Going home? - No, I'm going to Morocco. - No way! Ma. am? We haven't been introduced yet. Johnson, attach√© at the American Embassy in Morocco. I thought you were English. I just look like an Englishman. Perchance, I learned that you were headed to Agadir. I'm going back there myself in a few days. I live in a beautiful house. I'd be delighted to have you. Here's my card. Thank you. Our cab is here. - Your taxi is here, sir. - Thanks. The bus leaves in ten minutes. Should we load your luggage? Thank you. For you, my good man. - Thank you. - A tip. Since when do you tip? When in a capitalist country, a Marxist must act like a capitalist. I know, but don't overdo it. MOROCCO The first part of my plan went without a hitch. The people relevant to us will arrive in town tonight. Everything needs to be done with the utmost discretion. No publicity, no scandal. You'll obey Sparafucile's orders. Do we torture or kill them? Bathtub or hammer? No, no, no. I'm not interested in the details. All I need is the thing. A blue panther with ruby eyes. Get out. Listen to me, Sparafucile. I want nothing but a work of refined terror. Not too much blood, but suffocation, fear, any gentle method. Easy - Easy? No, not easy. The girl is dangerous because of her naivete. She doesn't know the rules of the game so she cheats, naturally. And you know me, Sparafucile: I can't fail. Everything that will happen here and now has been planned, and I am the mastermind. A mistake or a weakness is possible. Your fears are tiresome, Sparafucile. I thought of everything. Let Olga in. Olga, listen to me without saying a word. I have to put the blame on you. You have failed miserably, Olga. You deserve to be put to death. But lucky for you, this failure was part of my plan. So I'm ordering you again to get a hold of the Panther. She swore she didn't have it. Don't interrupt me, Olga. I suppose young Ivanov doesn't lack intelligence. He had his father ask you to work for him and you accepted. That is also deserving of death. But here again, your greed works to my advantage. So, I congratulate you on playing yourself so well, dear Olga. And I order you to continue. Get out. Look, Sparafucile. The sky is so beautiful today. Like velvet. My God, the sea is beautiful here. Can we go waterskiing? I think so. Of course, sir. At Ahmed Ali's. You're obsessed with skiing! I'd rather see belly dancing. - How about you? - Maybe. You like belly dance? Don't you know Hubert is a ballet aficionado? He did a choreography for his birthday last year. This year, it's a masquerade ball. Excuse me. Of course, you can't possibly know everything about us. No doubt. But would I like everything? Why? You're not in love with me anymore? I'm more in love with Marie than with Chantal. How strange, I don't understand a word he's saying. You're wrong. I'm not so sure. Good night. See you tomorrow. What's that all about? In love with you? Don't worry about it. You remind me of your mother. Dear Hubert, you'll take me to the souks in the morning. To the souks? To the souks?! Yes, I need to go talk to a man named Ali Kadour. And who is that? I don't know. And he's in the souks? I don't know. This is outrageous! Very well. I'll go by myself. - How much is this? - Eight thousand. It's too expensive. One thousand. Eight thousand. - No. Two. - Eight thousand. Tell me, do you know Ali Kadour? Ali Kadour? Yes, he's a vendor somewhere over there. Ah, yes, Ali Kadour. Eight thousand. Fine, I'll take it. So, where is Ali Kadour? I don't know any Ali Kadour. What do you mean? You're a thief! I'm not a thief! You ask, I sell, you buy, I give. You ask for Ali Kadour, I don't know him. The nerve! I won't stand for it. I'll file a complaint! The French always call us thieves. But it's just business. We're not thieves. - Sir. - Morning, ma'am. - Are you Ali Kadour? - I have jewelry, daggers. -Yes, I am. Silverware... -Do you know Bruno Kerrien? Who did you say? - Bruno Kerrien. - Why would I know him? He asked me to give you a panther. I don't know what you're talking about, but I know him. He asked me to give you the Blue Panther. I don't know about it, but if he asked you, then give it to me. Give me a dirham. Huh? You're nice. Give me a dirham. Here. Don't be afraid. Don't make any noise. Stay right where you are. Okay? Oh, no! Don't leave me alone. How's that? Better. I don't even know your first name. - Francisco. Paco. - Paco. Superb! What a spread. - Where are the forks? - Use your fingers. Use your thumb as a knife, your forefinger as a fork, and your middle finger as a spoon. - Like this? - It's disgusting. No. It's feudal! Watch me do it. Darn it! This burns like hell. They're regular women. Just a little less dressed. Adorable. - Ouch! - You wimp. I may be a wimp, but I'm observant. Did you see that woman? Black as sin, they say. Well, let's sin. Do you know who was at the hotel? No. The Russian from Verbois and his son. SQ? We got a call from Johnson. He's inviting us for dinner tomorrow. Johnson was in Verbois as well. So were we. So was he. He was in Verbois. It's like in vaudeville. Everyone always ends up in the same place. Strange, but dreadful. I feel like I've seen every hotel guest in Switzerland. Like this woman over there. Oh, yes. He's right. She was in Switzerland too. Here you are. As planned. Sit down. I hope we can reach an agreement and settle this matter for our own benefit. Don't doubt it, Dad. Here's what you'll do. A call for you from the American Embassy, miss. Dear friend, your cousin probably told you. Yes. Are you free tomorrow evening? Good. I'll be expecting you. While she's here, you'll search her room. It's time to put this whole thing to rest. It was Johnson, confirming tomorrow's dinner. Will you be going there? Of course. Why shouldn't I? You find it funny to be in danger? You make it sound like I'm in danger everywhere I go. Maybe you go places too often. I'd like to go with you. You weren't invited. Hubert will be my knight in shining armor. You have no idea what kind of world you've stumbled into. - Are you scared? - For you, yes. But aren't you here for better or for worse? Wouldn't you save my life? You're joking about such terrible things. Am I sophisticated? Yes, too bad. Silly goose, I know you have the Panther. Make up your mind, is it a panther or a goose? Thank you, good night. Admit it, you do have the Blue Panther. Why won't you get rid of it? Be nice and stop talking about the Panther. Do you understand that they'll kill you if you keep it? Who? The people around you, silly. You, maybe. No, not me. Thank goodness. Let's go for a walk in the morning. Don't change the subject. I'm busy tomorrow morning. Come on, give me the Panther. I told you I don't have it! Why lie? If you didn't have it, they wouldn't be hounding you. Who's hounding me? You're hounding me! What's the deal with that panther? What do you want it for? I have to tell you something. Let's say I do have the Panther. I wouldn't give it to you for the world. I hate it when people try to take what I don't want to give. Do you understand? Kiss me. Oh, thanks! See you tomorrow. - Hands up! - Don't shoot! Come on, open the door. Heavens, a transvestite. - Listen... - Move! Please! A woman dressed as a man! How kinky! - Listen to me! - That's all I'm asking. - Stand up! - Don't shoot, miss. We're both in danger of getting killed at any moment. I beg of you, let's join forces and get rid of the Panther. Have you ever heard of Dr. Kha? Who? Kha. Who's that Kha? A genius. He can predict your slightest move, your most trivial action. You think you're free, but suddenly you realize that everything was planned... by Kha! Congrats! He's really good if he can predict my actions; even my mother can't. You're so reckless. That man is evil incarnate. No one ever knew who Kha was working for. For himself, of course. Is he the one who planned the attack in the souks? Are you kidding? I wish! So native. And stop acting like a man. Take off your pants and shoes. The attack in the souks wasn't planned by Dr. Kha. It was Paco Castillo. You're clueless. I saw you holding hands in the hotel lobby. My poor child! After Dr. Kha, he's your most dangerous enemy. He's Puerto Rican. He belongs to a Pan-African terrorist organization that's also after the Panther. Did he ask you for it? He did. I told you so. What a despicable man! No, he's just doing his job. All jobs are valuable. But some are cruel. Castillo is capable of killing you if you don't give it to him. What's so special about that Panther? I don't know, I've never seen it. Can you tell me? Yes, I saw it. Bruno Kerrien showed it to me. It's a pitiful thing. I would never wear it. Very cheap. Get rid of it. But I don't have it. Think about Dr. Kha, the two Russians, Castillo, Johnson. Speaking of whom, he invited me for dinner tomorrow. And you're thinking of going? Of course. That's insane! Let's not blow this out of proportion. He's an attach√© at the US Embassy, not a killer. He was hired by the US Embassy because he's a killer! I'll just defend myself. What an immense pleasure to welcome you here, miss. Excuse me, I was at the beach. You know how it is, time flies when you're there and then you can't find a cab... - Where have you been? - No, it's all right. Beauty must keep people waiting. Would you like a drink, or have dinner right now? I'm starving, actually. Well then, as we say in Connecticut, let our teeth meet the fork! Hubert! You're a wonderful ambassador of French taste. Dress, earrings, so refined. Funny coincidence, don't you think? To meet in such different places as a dining car, a hotel in Switzerland, a villa in Morocco. It's a small world. If only that was it. But you don't know everything. My God, what a cough! What do you mean? Nothing in particular. You're right, it's a small world. Horrifyingly small. The Embassy is on the phone, sir. Ru get it. - Will you excuse me? - Please do. Well? Did you search her room? Nothing? Are you sure? As sure as of Allah's greatness, boss. We combed through her room and her cousin's room. If I say there's nothing, I mean not even a hair. She must have it on her, then. She won't leave this place before giving it to me. Actually, she won't be leaving... at all. Allow me to apologize once again. Before you got here, miss, your cousin and I were talking about your latest misadventures. Allow me to raise my glass to the end of all your trouble. After your trouble, you need a bottle. - What's happening now? - A fainting spell. - Could you help me carry him? - What do you mean? - Where are the servants? - Having fainting spells. Has your wine gone stale? Probably, miss. Looks like we have visitors. Probably for you. Who are they? Guests? Yes. My guests. Don't move! Your turn, Colonel. What the...? What's this about? I'm not a colonel. Come, quick! - What is this? - The cook. Why won't he open the door? - Don't fret, Dad. - You trust him? Of course. Shit. - A young lady stepped out. - Let's go to work! So, the best Soviet sleeping pills didn't work on you? Gregor! We've been duped! It's the idiot cousin. Hey, now! Stop the car! You like pranks, moron? Shut up! She played us, obviously. You're hurting me! Let go! - Let go. - Let go. Go! - It's too late now. - Too late! Stop. silly girl! Stop following me like a puppy. Rather a Newfoundland. Stop acting foolish and risking your life. Don't use such a tone with me, you spy! - Get in the car. - No! I know who you are. - Get in! - What right do you have? This right! Where are you taking me? To your hotel, you idiot! If it's the Panther you want, I don't have it. I'm not asking you for anything. Stop saying stupid things. At 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, I'll be waiting for you in the hotel lobby. If you don't show up, I'll go get you in your room. Get it? Who do you think you are? Your friend. A father. Come on, get out. I can't go out dressed like this. Put on a disguise, suffer the consequences. Go! Room 58 is dressed like a man. Thanks. Room 85 is dressed like a woman! Who is it? I don't know anymore! Open up! I'm so mad at you! I was abducted by the Soviets. They have to be arrested! I'll file a complaint at the consulate. Don't get undressed here. I'm not going out again in this outfit! You're just going up one floor. I don't know anymore. I'm exhausted. Please leave me alone. Leave me alone, leave me alone... What about my tuxedo? I'll give it back to you tomorrow. Just leave me alone. All right, I'm leaving. But I won't forget this! I don't know anymore... You scared me. I was worried about you. Very worried. How did you get in? Through the balcony. Come in. I'm dead tired. People attacking me was fun at the beginning, but now... Poor darling, you're not cut out for that kind of life. No, I'm not. It's a ruthless world, my angel. - I'll help you undress. - Thanks. It's a world of killers. I know all about it. I'm completely beat. That's completely natural, my dear. In this job, you can't pace your effort. You've always led a gilded life surrounded by people who supported you when you were tired. Lie down. I'll take your stockings off. You're nice. - Oh, no. - Yes, you are. No, I'm not nice. But you're the first human being I've ever met since I was born. If you only knew what I've gone through. All kinds of horror. My parents tossed from one Secret Service to another, sold by some, buying others. Murders, kidnappings, sabotages, one-night stands with ministers, servicemen, beastly men. Poor Olga. I want you to help me get out of this. Where's your nightgown? I wear pajamas. They're in the bathroom. You can help me get out of this disgusting world. You have the power to do it. Me? How? You know how. The Panther. I don't have it. Believe me, I don't. I believe you. Go to sleep. Good night, love. Don't scream, miss. Don't be afraid, everything is over for you. Congratulations, you were very skillful for a beginner. You duped all those idiots from Secret Services. But the Panther is in our hands now. You made the one mistake all beginners make, you took pity and believed in the tears of our formidable Olga. Her moaning was hiding the dexterity of her fingers and the coldness in her heart. Let that be a lesson to you, miss. Farewell. Mr. Castillo, please. Hello? Paco? I'll be there tomorrow, 8 a.m. Forgive me, I couldn't tell you anything before. Do you trust me? I have no one else to trust. I had to use you. There was no other way. I had to get the Panther back. What's so special about this panther? My poor darling. It contains the most powerful weapon of destruction that man ever had at his disposal. It's simpler than you think. Picture scientists from around the world pooling their knowledge to try and eradicate pain and sickness in the universe. You're kidding. Not at all. Don't believe that the most powerful people on Earth will leave this power in the hands of politicians, those megalomaniac, fickle, corrupt creatures. Politicians are just pawns on a chessboard, just like you and me. The fate of the world is actually in the hands of two men. Do you hear me? Only between two men. Like a game of chess. There were nine of us doing research, and no one knew about it. Nine of us under the guidance of a great man devoted to science. Maybe you've heard of him: Professor Lambar√©. Never heard of him. Your story is unbelievable. Believe me, it's the truth. Among the nine, there was a black sheep: Dumont. While trying to do good, it's easy to reach the worst. Dumont discovered the deadliest of viruses. And that's when Dr. Kha entered the stage. Somehow, he was made aware of Dumont's discovery and offered him a fortune for it. But who's Kha? Where does he come from? We don't know. We don't know where he got his considerable power. Can't he be arrested? You're being naive again. This is not a normal universe. Here, cops aren't enough to put things back in order. And like Alice, you went through the looking-glass. Dumont was carrying the virus inside the Panther. The fate of the world is now in your hands. From what I know about you, that should make you feel good. Paco, I... I don't have the Panther anymore. Dr. Kha took it from me last night. All is lost now. What a terrible mistake to give it to you. I should have taken it back from you right away. I fought alone for a long time. It was so much easier to keep an eye on you. You were as bad as the others. You let me put my life at risk. You made a fool out of me. I couldn't do otherwise. The stakes were too high. Now that I don't have the Panther, you're back to square one. All I have left is the eyes. - The eyes? - Yes. The little rubies were so cute, I had them made into earrings. You kept the Panther's eyes? Turned them into earrings? What's wrong? Are you crazy? Joy, ivy! These are tears of joy. Quick, let's go meet Dr. Lambar√©. The virus is in the Panther's eyes. Give them back. Don't act like a child. Give them back! Are you crazy? A gun? Where did you get it? Not from my luggage. I took it from someone threatening me. And I hate when people call me a child. Let's hurry and give the rubies to Lambar√©. He alone can destroy them. I'll see what I need to do. Can we get out of the sun? If I want to. Is Dr. Lambar√© here? Great doctor? He is here. But this is Dr. Kha! This is Dr. Kha! Professor Lambar√©? What's happening? You're Dr. Kha. That is indisputable. - But, Professor... - Quiet, Castillo. Stupid men like you shouldn't interrupt me. You thought you fooled me by setting the rubies aside? But you're a child. Both of you sit down, if you wish. Well, Castillo? Are you beginning to understand your part in this story? No? I used you to reel her in. The more you fought against me, the more you helped me. Yes, Castillo, the good professor Lambar√© and the demonic Dr. Kha have but one face. Yes, the game of chess has but one player. I'm having fun, Castillo. I'm having fun, it's divine! You're insane. You call craziness what you don't understand or what you're not brave enough to do. When those people, who think we are their servants, brought together those scientists to try and wash off the blood on their hands, they put me in charge, Castillo. They thought I was better than they were. They were right, I am the most intelligent being in the world. Sorry. I understand that such a statement causes hilarity to ensue. But in this particular instance, miss, it's entirely justified. Yes. Shortly, I will become the master of the Earth. As soon as you give me the eyes of the Panther, dear child. That's why I was laughing. I can't give you the eyes. The panther Bruno Kerrien gave me had no eyes. Don't taunt me. It's impossible. I have a feeling that Bruno Kerrien was smarter than you. You'll have to start over, from scratch. All this Work. All this work for nothing! Were you right to laugh, miss? Was I also duped by appearances? The Panther's body is nothing without its eyes. Everything needs to be redone. You were so determined to keep this thing that I never thought for one second that it was devoid of importance. To be duped by a low-ranking French intelligence officer! Kerrien! Of course, this is... absolutely hilarious! Why all the plotting? Why not ask Dumont to entrust you with his discovery? How could I trust such a greedy man? Dumont chose to sell it to the evil Dr. Kha rather than give it to the good Dr. Lambar√©. Not everyone is as idealistic as you are. Nor as... native. And the others were in my way. Where are they? Don't worry, you'll soon be with them. - Did you have them... - They were no longer useful to me. One died in his sleep, the other hunting, the third drowned and the rest vanished in the desert. What about us? You? I don't know yet which way you'll go. I know. Through the door, same way I came. Amazing creature. It's the first time someone talks to me this way. But keep going, miss. I'm enjoying it. I'm afraid this first time will be the last. - So do I. - Stop, imbecile! How dare you! Oh, I wouldn't dare, miss. Who gave you the order? Still using a razor? I thought it was the right thing to do. Later. And, Sparafucile... Device number 15. The blue light. Device 15. The ambulance. Thank you. Please excuse that little interruption. You were saying you would leave through the door? Yes. Certainly. But feet first? - I didn't say that. - Right. Two more shadows on your board. | Pity you. How novel! Pity me? Panther or not, eyes or not, virus or not, I don't care. Excuse me? I don't care if you resume your treasure hunt or not. - Be quiet. - You be quiet! It's the last time I can speak, I will take advantage of it. So this is the most intelligent man in the world? According to you, intelligence means having absolute power, therefore, absolute death. Is there anything more complete? Yes, sir. Love. Love, and I don't mean sex. I mean tenderness, trust, longevity. Every beautiful thing on Earth doesn't die, it lives on. If I were the most intelligent man in the world, I'd give humanity love and beauty. I would try to make them last forever. I would like for Earth to become a garden, where people would keep singing like birds. I'd give them eternal youth. In other words, exuberant kindness. I don't understand all this. What about this? Hands up! Shoot! Shoot! I can't. Let's go. That's for us. I only wear tailor-made clothes and I hate pine. What if I'm scared? Just hit harder. Ready? You go first. My leg! My leg! Fate tripped me. We need an extra mattress at the bottom of the trap. - Where's the ambulance? - Over there. - Sparafucile must have finished the job. - Good boy. Now, let's get back to our planning. What was her name again? - Marie-Chantal. - Ah, yes. Too bad. She seemed made for love. The moral lesson you taught Dr. Kha was wonderful. Where did you learn that? In the convent where I was a boarding student. Kiss me. Not on the cheek. It's so outdated. I didn't dare. Do you know why? - I'm too aloof. - No. - You don't like me? - I do! Men! Give them a finger, they want the whole arm. I thought that your cousin Hubert and you... Hubert? No. Hubert only likes colored women. - Really? - Yes. Watch out! Faster! I want her. I'll get her. I'm talking to you as a woman, a sister, mother and friend. Get rid of the earrings! I can't! You told me it was impossible. If I throw them in the sea, the virus will destroy the fish! - Ah! My suitcase! - Keep going! If I bury them, moisture will ruin them and destroy all vegetation. - What to do, then? - I'm keeping them! But Dr. Kha won't wait. He will hound you. I'll be eagerly waiting for him. I thought you'd be late again. - All's well? - Yes. She wins the first round, but beware of the second one. Look what I found for my masquerade ball! Where did you find it? For next to nothing, in the airport shop. - Please. - What's on the menu? Veal roast with creamed potatoes. No! If it starts all over again, I'm gonna turn violent.
