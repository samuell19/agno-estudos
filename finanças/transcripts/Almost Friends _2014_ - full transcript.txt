Lod A city of mixed Arab and Jewish population Heymann Brothers Films presents: A film by Nitzan Ofir & Barak Heymann Home? I want to bake a chocolate cake. What kind of chocolate cake? - A cake. I'll check on the internet. You want to check online? - Yes. How do you think I make a cake? Almost Friends When I went to school in Gedera (Jewish town), there were lots of Jews and no Arabs there. We were only three Arab families, so we went to a Jewish school and... I was 12. My father said: You should learn Arabic so they put me in an Arab school and I didn't understand a thing. But mom, can you tell me why I'm in a Jewish school and not in an Arab school? Your big brothers were in an Arab school and they put them down because even though we live here, there's no investment in Arab schools. and you should know Hebrew anyway, it's the language we have to learn because we live here. So you can get ahead in life. Here, it turned out well. Here, put this in a bag. A sandwich bag? -Yes. And this. Once when you were in kindergarden you said: Mom, let's celebrate Passover. And I said: Samar, we're Arabs. What you learn doesn't make you a Jew. You're an Arab. I have a picture from Israel's Independence Day where I was wearing something made of paper. -A flag. And I was covered with Israeli flags. You also have pictures from Hannuka when you're dressed up as a candle. But that doesn't mean you have to celebrate like a Jew. You know you're a Muslim, right? And you should be proud because your dad was from the West Bank. Be proud of your father. See how handsome he was. I know he was handsome. He was from the West Bank. That's the truth. But I'm not... I'm not from the West Bank. I'm an Israeli. Right, you're from here. But originally? -From here. -No. Originally. You're from here. -Your father wasn't. Be proud of what you are because that's how God created you. So accept yourself as you are, you're whole. Sapir Public School, Lod Hello. Danny. Didn't you see me? Did you see me? -Yes. Hello, children. -Hello. Please sit down. Hanan. -Here. Shlomo. -Here. Nadim. -Here. -Abed. -Here. Danny. -Here. -Noa. -Here. -Eden. -Here. - Samar. -Here Mayar. -Here. Shira. -Here. -Rotem. -Here. And Bat-El. -Here. All right, children, let's open the newspaper. Yossi, over the past week what current events... Without looking at the paper. What did you hear on the news? There was an important game. In which sport? Soccer. Tel Aviv against Haifa. And what was the score? I wasn't happy with the score. Why weren't you happy? Because Haifa won. OK. That was very current news... My sister lives in the south. She said there was a missile attack. There was an escalation on the southern border. Who can tell me what "escalation" means? Worsening. -Worsening. Excellent. Let's see what's happening in the paper. I'll ask... Danny. Go ahead. "Sirens were heard and 30 rockets landed in Israel". "Diplomatic efforts are not successful." OK, "Diplomatic efforts are not successful" and... "The Mayor stated: "We must find a solution, even a military one." What do you think? Do we need military solutions? We should fire missiles back at them. You suggest a military solution. -We can't just do nothing. Mayar. If Israel doesn't fire back they'll fire more and more missiles. So you say we need a military operation. Do you know the cost of a major military operation? In Israel or in Iran? -Not Iran. It's in Gaza. Endangering innocent lives. Death. -Death of whom? Both nations. -That's right. Telamim - Jewish religious village 67 km from Lod, near the Gaza Strip border "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who didn't make me a gentile." "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who didn't make me a slave." "Blessed is He who made me as He willed." "May it be Your will, O Lord, "my God and God of my fathers, that You teach me Your laws "and keep me close to Your commandments "Praises to the supreme God, "the blessed God. Moses and the Children of Israel..." Listen. You're at the beginning of a new road. Your Bat Mitzvah is its peak. Until we get there many things will pass your way. Now you're going through adolescence and you want to show yourselves and be pretty. You can dress up fashionably but still modest. To know that our bodies are precious, not cheap. I won't sell it or show it to anyone. You have to stay modest. I want to hand out a letter. A boy wrote a letter to his guide. Let's read it together. Tell me what you think. "I wanted to tell you something personal. "I'm sure you'll understand me although what I did won't look good. "We went to the bonfire together, boys and girls. "Before that I spoke to my girlfriend Reut. "We've been going out for 6 months now. "I noticed that recently we've become even closer, "and we are really happy about it. "So after everything heated up the joy began. "We sang, we laughed, and played music around the bonfire. "Reut suggested we go upstairs where it was quieter. "I agreed and we went up. "On the way we laughed at Tamar, the prude of the troop. "She was sitting alone, not with the boys. "She and a few other girls were alone. "Anyway, Reut and I went upstairs. "Reut sat next to me and we started talking. "Suddenly,I found myself getting closer but Reut didn't mind. "She ignored it and went on talking as if nothing was happening, "Untill I was actually hugging her. But she still didn't say a word. "When the bonfire was over we parted with a friendly handshake. "Now I admire Tamar." Do you remember who Tamar was? The one who sat by herself, with the girls. "Kids may laugh at her, but at least she's decent. "She doesn't touch boys and boys will never touch her "because she projects something else - modesty. "To be honest, I think I'm Reut's boyfriend "because she doesn't mind sitting with the boys "and she isn't too religious. She is open-minded, "but by the time I get married I'll find someone else "who thinks more highly of herself. "Thank you, Amichai." Why does he suddenly look at Reut in a different way? She is not modest, she doesn't have inner modesty, She doesn't respect herself. It also shows disregard. -Disregard of what? Of her self-respect. Very good. A Jewish girl is a princess, and should act like one. She can't dress or speak however she wants, she can't shout and go wild. She's a princess. She has to act accordingly. Like this. I'll get you a towel. There are three commandments that Jewish women must keep. Candle lighting, the separation of the challah, and Menstrual Impurity . This is a very important commandment, it's for blessings, for success, for prosperity, for lots of good things. Does that feel nice? -It's my first time. Here, take the water. Mommy's adding oil. It's getting easier. How does it feel to knead? -Nice. What are you doing with the dough? -Squishing it. Uniting all the ingredients,right? -Right. What does that mean? Like the unity of the Jews. -Right. I'll clean you. Feels nice, right? Let's create shapes? You see? You'll make the letters? I'll roll up your sleeve to make it easier. A little more. On the sides. It's fun to bake with you. I want to do it every day. This is a time when you can ask God for things. Here at home it's nice and warm but there are people and families living outside. -Right. So may they have homes, too. -Amen. May God help everyone. And may we all be happy. Okay, mothers, our girls are Bat Mitzvah age (12), our boys are Bar Mitzvah age (13), and the "Pass-The-Word" Project chose to have us get together with a school in Lod. A secular school. A secular Jewish school which Muslims and Christians also attend. I checked out the school and found out that they have discipline, manners, decency, and no violence at all. The question is, will we allow them to chat on the computer. I think they should be exposed to other students because they should learn that there are all kinds of people. As far as chatting, I think we parents should focus on that. The chat is through the school website so it's monitored. If it's monitored, no problem. but if it's uncontrolled like Facebook, no way. Parents should watch over, because there have been cases... You want them to meet, You see beauty in these meetings, learning about other cultures. Why does it stop in the chat? Because you don't know where it can lead to. So why not think about it in the first place? It's controlled. -What's controlled? Their feelings? Their relationships? How can you control that? I don't believe that at the age of 12 there'll be feelings of... Do you know how many Jewish girls from the area from nice, big Jewish cities are married to non-Jews? We're going to expose 12-year-old girls, most of whom are women now, to the possibility of relationships with other races, with the approval of parents and teachers. It's terrible. I think you're overreacting. I don't believe that if she meets an Arab boy now they'll eventually get married. I want to clarify the point and this reminds me of this week's Torah Section of Noah, The Flood. What is the flood? Great confusion. Too much rain, too many relationships. What do we need it for? They're good, we're good, but we don't belong together. But we are together, like it or not. It exists, they will grow up to a reality that has non-Jews in it, not only Jews. I'm not going to discuss why they're here and why we're here and who should be here and who shouldn't. Even in situations when we don't involve them in, they're exposed to relationships with non-Jews which is a catastrophe. So here, its not that they met a nice Arab doctor and, God forbid, made a connection. And where does it come from? The Torah forbids it: "Getting together brings people closer." And if I don't have coffee with you, I won't get closer to you. And if these rules are clear to our girls, they'll stay away. But what's the problem? The problem is what comes later. Do you want your daughter to marry an Arab? No. -So don't start now. I think it's an absolute no. Letters to the girls from Telamim School They're religious so I don't know if they listen to songs in English or watch TV series. Maybe they watch nothing but the news? I don't think they're so different from us. Their belief in God? I believe in God, I do the wine blessing. My grandma keeps Shabbat, So I keep Shabbat with her. I light candles, I celebrate all our Jewish holidays, everything. They believe in God and we believe in God but we do things differently. We Arabs believe in God but we don't do what Jews who believe in God do. We all have different customs. Do you believe in God? -Of course. But not everyone believes in God. For instance, there was a boy in our class who didn't believe in God, he'd say: "What is God anyway?" and stuff like that. Did you write that you're a Muslim Arab? First I want them to see me and get to know me and only then find out I'm an Arab. I'm afraid the word "Arab" will frighten them. Maybe she'll ignore the fact that I'm an Arab, she'll read the letter and realize I'm not like all the Arabs and maybe she'll like me. But not all the Arabs are scary and criminal and all that. What did you write in your letter? I wrote that I'm a Muslim Arab. Read the letter. Let's see. Hello, Tahel Cohen. I love to play and sing. I have a 6-month-old kitten. I'm a Muslim Arab living in Lod. I'd really like to know what type of a Jew you are. Do you watch TV? I'd really like to meet you. If you're confident, if you like to play and sing, if you like to talk to friends. Love, Samar. "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who didn't make me a gentile." "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who didn't make me a slave." "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who chose us from all the nations and gave us His Torah. "Blessed are You, O Lord, giver of the Torah." Whenever I hear that blessing I think of my kids. Linor, Inbal, Shirel, Elya, Ariel, bless them. Tell me what you want, darling. The usual sandwich? -Yes. Mom. -What, honey? You know that... we learned about the girls... from the school in Lod. And there are Arabs there too. -Yes. It's mixed. -Mixed? And there's one that I want to be pen pals with. That's great, Linor. When Mommy was young I used to write to a girl named Hila Materna. It's a lovely experience, being a pen pal, not just talking on the phone. You write to each other and she sends you a little gift. It inspires you and brings you closer. But there's a problem. -What's the problem? The girl I'm talking to is an Arab. That's no problem. You can talk to an Arab. How do you want your sandwich? Like this? -Yes. That's no problem, Linor. Mommy lived in a settlement next to Gaza. We had... Daddy had workers... from the territories. -Grandpa? -Yes. You know who brought them home? Grandpa. And sometimes? Mommy. You took them home? -Yes. If you... If you went to meet her and they asked you to be alone with her, wouldn't you be worried? Being alone? -With her. No, there's nothing to fear. There's nothing to fear. Letters from the girls of Lod school Yours, Samar. It's kind of scary. -What's scary? That she is... She's an Arab, she isn't like us. She isn't a Jew and that's kind of scary. It's because... we're fighting against people like her. When I read the letter from the Jewish girl she said that... that it isn't so... "It isn't so bad to go to school with the Arabs. "They act just like us. They're normal." But she knows all about us. She could investigate us and we wouldn't know. It's not safe. I wasn't scared at all because they're just like us. They feel just like we do. If it was... the other way around and we wanted to go to Gaza, that's exactly how they'd feel. They'd be scared because... just as they bomb us, sometimes we bomb them. So it's almost the same. But we don't bomb them for no reason. They don't bomb us for no reason either. They want to kill us. They have a goal. Believe me, there are people... They want our land. -All right. But there are people in Gaza who aren't... who are not bad. Who are just like us, normal. Hello. We're coming to Ramallah, me and Samar. Can you come at 4:00 or later? I'll be in touch. Bye. We'll send you to the West Bank for summer vacation. -No. Don't you enjoy being there? Sometimes. Listen, Samar, they're your family. Who do you have here in Israel? You have your siblings, yes. And me. But you have cousins there. The whole clan is there. If, God forbid, something happened to me, almost all your family is there. Right? Hello. Give me your papers. Go ahead. Welcome. How are you Uncle? -Hello, Hello. How are you? -Good. welcome. Who are you talking with? -With a friend of mine. What's her name? -Hannan. I'll show you her photos soon. -Okay. On Instagram. Is she with you at school? Yes, we study together, Jews and Arabs. -How many girls are you in class? Arabs? Me, Mayar and Hannan. And boys too? No, just the girls. -Me, Mayar and Hannan, three Arab girls. Who's your favorite friend? Eden... She's not an Arab. -Jewish? -Yes. Do you get along with the Jewish girls? Do they treat you good? There are only two girls who swear at Arabs and say ugly things. -Do you speak with them? I don't speak with them. Who do you like more, the Arabs or the Jews? Who do you communicate better with? The Jewish ones. Because the Arabs... Where is it better, here or there? There. Do you want to go back home? -Yes. How long until you come back? -Long. How long? -Don't know. A month, two, three months. Until the Jews have a holiday. But Mom, I have exams this year. All right, make them count, I want to be proud of you, I want good grades. Besides, we want to marry you here. -No. Then where do you want? In Lod? We'll take your uncle there. We don't agree with it, we want to marry you here. I don't agree. -She doesn't agree. What? -She doesn't agree. Why in Lod? -Because. I want to mount you on the horse. -I don't want to. You're scared of the horse? -Yes. Don't distance yourself from us. Israel Memorial Day Have you seen the redness That screamed into the distance A golden field faded into darkness And kindled hyacinth candles Have you seen the redness That screamed into the distance A field of blood was there before And now it's a field of poppies Don't pick, my young man There are flowers that pass away There are flowers that eternally Remain in the melody... Please stand for the singing of HaTikva (The Anthem). As long as deep in one's heart The soul of a Jew yearns And toward the East Forward An eye looks to Zion Our hope is not yet lost The 2,000-year-old hope Of being a free nation in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem Of being a free nation in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem Lod "Hello. My name is Rotem "and I want to tell you about myself. "I have a special family. "I came from a sperm bank. "I have a mother whom I really love "and we live together. "I don't know my father and I don't know who he is, "but I'm sure I have one "and when I'm 18 I'll find out. "I'm almost 12 and my Bat Mitzvah is next week "and I'm really excited. I await your reply." I had to write that I'm from a sperm bank? Because maybe I shouldn't write that in my first letter. I think it's good that you wrote it, so she knows who you are. It's important. You're special. Do you think there are other girls from the sperm bank? I want to know about other sperm bank kids. It's possible. Maybe there are sperm bank girls there. I wish she'd write back that she's from a sperm bank too. It's possible. -Anything is possible. Where's her father? A sperm donation. What's a sperm donation? Should I explain it to you now? What's a sperm donation? -I'll tell you later, okay? What is it? "My family is special, "I come from a sperm bank." "I have a mother..." Move. -Hold on. "I don't know who my father is... When I'm 18 I'll find out." She scares me. If someone wrote to you: "I'm from a sperm bank." what would you do? Nothing. Blow her off. We've gathered together for a short brainstorming about the meeting with the girls from the school in Lod. Are we going to meet them? -Yes. Are we? -They should come here. Either they'll come here or we'll go there. What do they look like? They're secular schoolgirls, some are Arabs. Do you think they'll be wearing skirts? Yes. -One is religious. A religious girl? She wrote to us: "I'm religious. I don't know about my father." "I'll find out when I'm 18." What's her story? -We don't know. If she'll only find out about her father when she's 18. She's probably adopted. An adopted girl can only find out who her parents are when she turns 18. I guess she has foster parents. -No, she knows who her mother is. Her father is... -A sperm donation. What's a sperm donation? The whole subject of having children not in the natural way mother, father and children, that's not the subject now but it's worth discussing. Our subject now is the meeting with the girls from the school in Lod. How do you feel? I'm scared. -Again? -Yes. What are you afraid of? Maybe they won't accept me. -Why wouldn't they? And why did you wear a skirt? Out of respect. You want them to treat you like... Huh? To show them: I'm an Arab but I'm showing you respect? -Yes. Good Morning. What are you wearing? It is torn but you can't see the skin. Go change your clothes please. You can't come to school like this. But you can't see the skin. -I don't care, I don't want torn jeans. You can't come to school wearing that. It's hard, isn't it? -Very. Hello pretty girls. -Is this too short? Should we change? Are you experimenting today? I don't like it at all. Did you bring other clothes? Sweetie, you're fine. How are you? -Thank God. God bless you. How are you? -Fine. Are you going to school? We have a meeting with the Lod girls today. From the Lod school. -The Lod school... About what? Our "Bat Mitzvah" project. They have two Muslim girls as well. They'll be 12 girls, two of whom are Muslims. Two Muslim girls and they're so curious about Jewish customs? Maybe. How do you feel about them coming? Did they prepare you? They prepared them, too. But I'm asking you. Did they prepare you? Yes? Because there's always this "Sting". No matter what they say. There's always this "sting" between Jews and Arabs. No matter what. That's nothing new. It's been going on for ever. You should be relaxed and not get upset by what she says. So good luck and Grandma loves you. May God protect you. Do you know what Saturn's moon is called? Titan. Do you know it's the biggest of Saturn's thousands of moons? Jupiter and Saturn have lots of moons. Yarden, please go to the office and look for another basket. If you want, there's a story here about how... Uranus revolves on its axis. Open up to page 25. Do you know this is how Titan looks in an aerial photo? It's usually covered in fog, but when the fog disperses you can see Saturn from Titan. Girls, I'm coming to talk to you. I see you're a little worried about the meeting. Do you want to share with me how you feel about the meeting? Yes, Linor. I spoke to my mom and dad and grandma about the meeting. My grandma explained that no matter how hard we try, there's always this "sting" between us and... the Muslims. So she prepared me for the meeting and wished me luck and told me I have nothing to fear, nothing to worry about. What were you worried about? What were you afraid of? I've never spoken to a Muslim girl before. Do you realize that the Muslim girls speak Hebrew and if they sit in a circle and you try to guess who's a Muslim, you won't be able to. Even the Muslims whom you're so afraid of are God's creation. You remember we learned about the parting of the Red Sea, when the Egyptians drowned and the Israelites began to sing? What did God tell them? "My creatures are dying and you're singing?! "Is this any time to sing? "I'm sad. My creatures are drowning in the sea. "This is no time to sing." All people were created in God's image. If we have disagreements, we express them, but with respect. We don't have to agree, but we have to respect each other. Hello. -Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Sigal. -I'm Ofra, the school principal. Sigal, what are you? -I'm the homeroom teacher. How are you? -Nice to meet you. Harav Kuk Religious School, Telamim Exciting, isn't it? -Very. How are the girls? -Excited. Curious. What do they know about us? We told them where your school is. They're very curious because it's a religious school. As you know, we have a mixed population. What are the percentages? In my class it's almost a third. It grows every year. One-third Arabs? -Yes. There are Muslims and Christians. And they're excited. You know... What is the background of the Jewish girls whose parents don't mind this? They all live in Lod. Lod is an integrated city. I wasn't exposed to it until I started working there. I'm originally from Holon. So it's amazing. It's totally natural. People live next door to each other for 50 years. It really is special. They're here, they're here. I saw them, they're here. Let's sit in a circle. I have a ball here and you'll pass it around. Make a kind of network. Rotem, pick it up. My name is Rotem and I like to have fun. -Have fun? -Yes. What do you mean? -Have fun with friends. -Okay. My name is Linor. I live in Telamim and I like... to sing. My name is Noa and like Rotem I like to have fun, to go to movies with friends. My name is Yarden. I like to read books and I come from Nir-Chen. Excuse me. My name is Samar and I also like to sing. What? -To sing. -To sing? -Yes. Will you sing for us? Now I want to play the couples game. A girl from Telamim and a girl from Lod sit facing each other. You look at each other without talking, no talking. For two minutes, and then you say what you each saw in the other. Three, four, begin. Okay, girls. Those were two long minutes. Now each of you does the assignment. Do you remember what it was? You look at each other and say what you see in the other. You are the first one. -No, you start. Okay, go. You know it's true, there are some people, even Jews, who behave in an extreme way, like a "sting". But you're something special, and I don't care if you're Jewish or whatever. Want to see my pictures? Upside-down. How sweet. That's my mom. -Who's that? -My aunt. My dad died when I was two-and-a-half. I never really knew him. I don't know him. I never saw him or enjoyed him. How did he die? -He died on May 12th. He was murdered. -Who murdered him? I have no idea. He was murdered because... because he parked his car somewhere and caused an accident. Someone ran into his car and took his car for parts he was walking down the street He was a little drunk and they grabbed him and beat him up. He died of the first blow. And that's it. God bless you. Don't cry. Still, you have a good life, right? Thank God, you still have a mother and family. But you still miss him. I'm not saying you shouldn't miss him, I'm not saying you should stop. You should take it to heart, but now that it's over you should start a new life. You have friends, thank God, and lots of things. I want to go wash my face. I'll come with you. Ice cream or popsicle? A popsicle. Is the boy with the hat in your class? -No. The crazy kids are always cute, aren't they? Yes, he was cute. There was a super-crazy kid, and we made friends, but he got kicked out of school. So who is the girl who will only see her father at the age of 18? She's Rotem. How did your father... What did my father do? He gave his sperm to a sperm bank. You don't know what sperm is? -No. -Then drop it. You're too young. Next year I'll tell you. -No. When they teach you about sperm you'll understand. Come on, what's sperm? -You know how a woman has an egg? What? -Yeah, yeah. A man has sperm. When they get together they make a baby. And? -And that's it. They get together and make a baby. Go to the bus. See you. -Bye. How are you? -Fine. How was it? -Fine. Just "fine"? I thought it might be strange for you. After all, it's the first time you meet a Muslim, you can call her Arab, and you're a Jew and you don't know their mentality. That's why grandma is explaining the difference between us and the Muslims. If a Jew sees an Arab dying, he'll help him. If an Arab sees a Jew dying he won't help him. He'll finish him off. That's the difference. Yes, but Samar is different. You can't even tell she's a Muslim. -That's the point. How's it going? How was it? -Fine. -Were you nervous? I met a Muslim girl named Samar. We both asked whether we could... If it's alright for us to keep in touch. I'll tell you what. There's a thing not to intermingle outside the Jewish people. We're not allowed to mix with them, it's called assimilation. A Jew has to marry a Jew. Because we're the chosen people. But I'm not about to marry her. There's a Jewish law not to pour wine... Let me explain. You're saying, "I'm not about to marry a non-Jew," right? But it's a matter of habit. I'll teach you. You're still young but I'll teach you. People say "love". It isn't love. There is no love. There's only habit. When you get used to someone, it's not so bad anymore. A Jewish girl and a gentile girl aren't allowed to be together? To be pen pals or Facebook friends isn't so bad. Your mother can keep tabs on you. If she sees you getting off track she can cut it off. You see? You're not meeting her. When you meet, it's an accomplishment for them to drag a Jewish girl into their dirty world. You see? Hello Samar, how are you? I'm dying to see you again. I feel like we haven't seen each other for ages. What do you think? Love, Linor. Hello Linor, I want to see you again, too, so we can talk and play, and I hope it happens soon. When I told my mom that girls from Lod School are coming, she said: "Wow, really?" She was really glad that I was going to meet new friends. And my grandma said: "No matter how close you become, "there'll always be this sting "between us and Arabs." I was a bit opposed to what Grandma said because I took it hard. The thing is, Samar is a girl who's just cute as hell, how to say it? Every person would want such a friend. If Samar was to invite you to her house? Would your parents have agreed? My mom and dad... Wouldn't have agreed. Indeed, Samar's family is alright, but I'm talking about outside... There are also Arabs who are out of their minds, which is very dangerous. In my village there are quite a few Arabs driving trucks. You realize they're not so bad. You know why? Once, when I saw an Arab in the village, I was walking to the playground and when I passed I did like this. He did like this too. All people, no matter if they're Arabs, gentiles or anything else, they're God's children, His sons and daughters. So they aren't so different. We aren't so different. We're alike, we're brothers. That's where you're wrong, big-time. There's a good heart or a black heart. We have a soul, while gentiles and Arabs have only a spark. A spark from the soul. We're less aggressive. They're much more. -They're much more aggressive. They have no mercy and we do. That's the big difference between us. What are you doing for vacation? I have Ramadan. Do you do anything special on Ramadan? Do you have to go to... the mosque, or... -I don't have to. Do you go? Sometimes. What was the name of the girl you met from Telamim School? Linor. Are you still in touch? I was but it stopped. I sent her a message a month ago and she didn't reply. You tickle me. -Oh, sorry. Would you like Linor to come visit you? I don't think so. Why not? Because there are many Arabs there. They're what? -Arabs. Two big crime families. So what? There are Arabs in school, too, and I have Arab friends, so what? If she comes to my house, there could be a gunfight or an explosion and I don't want her to get hurt, certainly not because of me. What do you mean an explosion? Out of nowhere? Yes. How do you think explosions happen? They announce them first? They just set them off and go.
