NON-PROFIT, NON-COMMERCIAL AND INDEPENDENT FAN PRODUCTION FINANCED THROUGH CROWDFUNDING They roam the land, importunate and insolent. nominating themselves the stalkers of evil, vanquishers of werewolves and exterminators of spectres. Verily, there's nothing so hideous, as the monsters, so contrary to nature, known as witchers. For they are the offspring of foul sorcery and devilry. The easiest access they find at cottages of honest, simple and unwitting peasants, who readily ascribe all misfortune and ill events to spells, unnatural creatures and monsters. Instead of praying to the gods, and bearing rich offerings to the temple, such a simpleton is ready to give his last penny, to the base witcher, believing the godless changeling, will turn around his fate and save him from misfortune. Gullible people they deceive, claim to offer protection. They claim to slay monsters for people's sake. Though it has long been proven, it's only for their own amusement, as murder is their favorite entertainemnt. In preparation for their doings, in witchcrafty they dabble. They're rogues without virtue, conscience and scruple. True diabolic creations, fit only for killing. There is no place amidst honest men for such as they. And yon Kaer Morhen, where these wicked beings nestle, where they perfom their foul pratices, must be wiped from the surface of this earth, and all trace of it strewn with salt and salpetre.

COSTUMES SOUNDTRACK VFX SUPERVISOR CAMERAWORK But the one, who once escaped death Shall not find peace nor at night, nor at day The glow in her eyes had disappeared For the death’s shadow couldn’t be swayed In the south, a baleful song reigns Be all ears, when the legend grows A man fades, but the legend remains For true blood’s what in it flows For true blood’s what in it flows Mahakam’s snows are melting. Dandelion. Moss covers the barrows, and you... beautiful as ever. - Ready? - As always. Merigold! - Some people grow old. - It's a typically human affliction... ...old man! Is it just human, though? Fuck off, Dandelion. What are you doing here, Merigold? Hunting witches. Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Han! Han! Leave -- He looked just like 'im! So I asked him: "How will you call it?". And he says... Dandelion, please... And he says...? "Roach". Apparently when he was fucking Fringilla, he called her "Yenn" at the end... - Yes... Good old days. - Let's get to the business. Got any news from Vizima? From Vizima? You waste no time, Triss. Ah! There’s my proud offspring. A true flower amongst the weed! - I didn't know you had... - Bastards? Loads of little Dandalions roam this earth. But Julian is the least of a bastard out of all of them. She was still a virgin, you whoreson! Back off, ogre-face! Leave him be! Sit your arse down and shut up. Come out you cunt! Geralt would've helped. He's not here though. Thought you could hide from me, eh? I'll kill ya! No, no, no! I can explain! - You ploughed her! - Pa! - You fuckin' maggot ... - Pa, please! Please, Pa! I’ll squash you like a worm! - Pa! - What? He'll... He'll... - What? - He'll marry me! What?! Yeah, yeah, yeah... I will. - That's better. - Cheers to the groom! My son? - Fuckin' hell, I warned ya, gaffer! Leave the gaffer alone. Quit meddlin', ya vagrant! - Mutant! To arms! Take 'im lads! - Come on! We'll get the fucker! Go on, give ma a reason you bumpkins. Didn’t I tell you?! A witchman! We're leaving, junior. Bloody ‘ell! It’s said they’ve all died out! Come on lads! There’s a bounty on 'is head! - Lads! Get the mutant! - All together! Take 'im! - Catch! Be of some use, bloody fool! Father, please hang in there. You've gone completely mad! The older you are, the dumber you get! I couldn't resist. That blockhead had: „Throw a mug at me” written all over his forehead. Do something, Merigold! It's his hearth. Magic won't help here. Father! You have to admit... That swing I took at him... was a good one... I felt just like... in the good old... Something ends... and something begins. Word of this brawl will spread fast. We shouldn't have let that happen. We? None of that would've happened if only Dandelion had looked after his bastard. You realise there’s a bounty of three thousand orens on your head, right? For the last of the witchers? I thought it'll be at least five. In Novigrad crowns. Listen. I can't draw attention to myself now. I'm not after some mere sorceress, I'm after an Aretuza renegade. A storm is coming. No one saw you? No one, except for ghuls. Folk keep away from the graves. Just in case. That's wise of them. What do you mean? You'll see. Monsters will soon return. During my studies I observed a certain regularity. Since the Conjunction of the Spheres monsters appear recurrently. Only few of them left now, but soon they'll emegre from their lairs again. We have to be ready. Shame they didn't appreciate that theory of yours at the Academy. Have you already forgotten, who saved you from that Academy? No. How could I? Half of Thanned was ablaze. You mad witch! Speaking of witches. Still nothing? I cannot see her. She must've used a protective spell. HALF A CENTURY OF POETRY So, the Lodge can't handle it, huh? - Can't you just leave her be? - Not Ornella. We suspect that she may have found the Alzur's Almanac. Alzur of Maribor? - That fucker obsessed with gene-alteration? - Yes. The one who created you. the witchers. Alzur's and Malaspina's writings were lost long time ago. That's why I'm here. I have to uncover the truth. But now that Dandelion is dead, I’ve lost my trail... - The Realms... - Fuck the Realms! Nobody cared what was happening to the witchers, when Kaer Morhen ran with my brothers' blood. I need you, witcher. - Let's avange them together. - You want revenge? On whom? I saw this whoreson burn. If not for Vesemir, I would be dead too. Lambert! The witchers are no more, Merigold. Maybe that's for the best. We're wasting our breath on those ungrateful bastards. Shut up already! You're talking to me, kid? He told me about all of you. Of your strength, courage. Of the White Wolf, who defeated the Shrike and defended the town of Rinde against a Djinn. Yet he never mentioned you. Now, I know why. You're right. What the hell are you looking at? Take it! I'm fucking sick of this shit. He'll get over it. It was him. With friends of Gwynbleidd. Tried to track them, but the sorceress used her magic. You don’t say. What a clod! Gather the lads, muster some axes, slingshots and pitchforks! - Down with the whoresons! - Down with them! The freak. Eyes of a cat. I know he was here. Look at that, another mutant. Fuck off and get out! Let him go! Pa! I'm gonna ask again! - Where did the witcher set out to? - Wait, M'lord! Drunk Master Dandelion was telling they're heading north, to Maribor. A sorceress was with them. The one from the Sodden legends! Finally. I found them. You know what to do. Any objections? Are you really that scared of people? It was so long ago. I'll be fine. You have to bring that up every time? Until you understand not all dream of the smell of non-humans burning at the stake. Anything else? Yes. Be careful. There's just one problem. I've never seen a witcher in my life. How will I find him? He wears the amulet in the shape of wolf's head. And? - Is it far yet? - Trust me. - My father I mean. - I don't know which is worse. You sure you know they way? I told you. Father wrote everything in his book. Did he also write which brothel he conceived you in? No, but here’s something more interesting. Would you like to hear a limerick? Would you like me to kick your ass? See that river? It's Chotla. Finally. This is the field by Brenna. Here is where the greatest battle in the world's history took place. Sure, it's a great time for a history lesson. I’m going to take a piss. On this very field... where my mother spilled blood... I lay your ashes, father. So that after death... you shall be joined, in an everlasting love. But each one, all of 'em are the same. Take a look, so round and beatiful. Tis no roach, lad. Tis a trout, straight from a brook, for god's sake. Great, alright. - Your apples. - How's it gonna be? - One, two? - It's there, little further now. Bloody hell. - Why didn't we go to Brenna? - Too many eyes out there, she said... Elixirs, herbs. - Horses. We're looking for some horses. - I have no horses, M'lady. - Take a goose. - Maybe a nice, fat chicken? - We don't need any geese. - A beauty medalion. You won't find better ones in whole Vizima! That's no roach, eh! Best potatoes. Fucking hell... Some descrete arrival... They have a stable and a tavern here too. Let's try to pull some tongues and we'll leave at dawn. You'll leave at dawn. I'm going back to south. Tatties, tatties! Is my sight playing tricks on me? Could it be... Triss Merrygoat! Welcome to Young Bottoms, M'lady! Friend of yours, 'Merrygoat'? Seldomly do we get such a noble person come in our lands, especially in Young Bottoms! But where're my manners? I'm Hairanus, the mayor of this here village! I'll be damned! And this... is it master... Gaylord of Rivia, the Witcher? and his friend... master Dandelion? Daisy will be delirious with joy when she sees you! You must be weary? We sure are, dear mayor. We are starving. I can tell by your faces! Don't go to the tavern. You'll find nothing but stench, syphilis and overprice in there. Come to my house instead! Thereat I say! My child... let me. I shalt grind, and you go fetch some more wine. Aye, we'd use a witcher here, in Young Bottoms, no doubt. Wasn’t it called 'Old Buttoms' before? Twas. We even used to compete with Brenna, cause the battle with Imperials was on our field, But the name didn’t suit. And so we changed it. 'Young Bottoms', you see, sounds prettier, eh? Truly mayor! Much better! Tell us more about that witch who’s kidnapping children. Whore maggot. Dwells in the woods, north of the road. It all began in the spring. After she woke up from that century-long slumber of hers the orphans and poor children started to disappear. - The hag gobbles them up. - Gobbles up? Aye, gobbles them up. Luring them away with sweetmeat. Siblings went missing of late. Don't hold your breath - Merigold. - But it'd make sense. Ornella escaped just before Belleteyn. You think it's her? Heavens sent you! Wait right there, ... I’ll find some advance, something to seal our deal. It's not about the money, mayor. I'm not a wi... Aye... we’re no wealthy folk, but had we visited a few villages, we'd surely collect quite a handsome amount, master witcher. We’ll take care of her, good sir. I'm training to become a witcher! Adventure! We know little about love. Love is like a pear. A pear... is sweet and has a shape. Try to define the shape of a pear. To hell with all those florans and bucklers! Even de Ruyter himself spoke kindly of our wine! - Then, later on, he sure died, - Poison... a hero's death fighting the Black Ones. Poison! - You think it was... - The girl. Twasn't her! Twasn't my Daisy! Believe me good sir! We'll take care of it. Better stay here. I'm goin'... or... I'm not. Ne'er been this way before! Gods! E'en the crones' fairy tales said nothing 'bout this! Who are you? Twas some fuckin' witchcraft! Some lad was kissing our Daisy, and suddenly, there goes! Puff! As if by sorcery, she turned into another lad! That other lad knocked the first one 'ere out. took 'im like a sack of taters And off he went! The pansy was here. I swear to gods! Don't mock us. Unless you want the sorceress to use her wand and turn you into a lass. But I'm tellin' the truth! With my own eyes I saw! One lad was suckin' another lad's lips! Let him go, Lambert. It must've been a doppler. Shapeshifter. Where did he take the boy? To the forest! Where all the malice dwell! Master Witcher! Master Witcher! Twasn't her! I told you so! My child! I was so worried! What now, Merigold? A romantic stroll in the woods? Do I have to beg for your help? You think you could? I could use some orens, I reckon. I haven't been to a brothel for ages. And that's the Lambert I know. I've caught a trail. Don't pretend. I wasn't. Just didn't want to interrupt your witchcraft. Witchcraft? Do you believe in everything, they say about me? But you are a witch. You kidnap orphans. And then I flail, bake, and eat them. With some fava beans, and a nice Toussaint's Est Est. Oh no, my dear. My appetite is much bigger than that. I started these rumours myself. The folk are afraid of witches. And I need privacy for my research. You haven't found any in Aretuza? And that book is...? Let me guess. Something about the witchers, and how to make them. Well, well, well. You're not that stupid. I take that after my father. I see that said research don't go too well. Which one is it already? Be quiet. Kaer Morhen had a better survivability. At least three out of ten survived the mutations. This is where the trail goes cold. And here I was expecting a gingerbread hut. Noo! No! No! No! No! I think we need to have a little chat. No! No, master Hexer! I'll explain everythin', I swear! - Yeah? - Everythin', yeah! Let's go to the back. I will lead you to another entrance. Stop squirming. - Where are you keeping him? - It's not far! The young master is unhurt. Lambert. I feel something strange. Anything more? So much more. Told you he was a doppler. First the bonds, now this... Maybe you'd at least tell me your name? Do you wish to lose your tongue? On the contrary. It happens to be useful. Why all this? Boggick, my servant... He thought you're the witcher's disciple... that's so... Curses. He got away. There's something in there. M'lady! - M'lady! - Not now, moron. But M'lady, the sorceress and... My, my. Quite an interesting reaserch you're conducting... Ornella. You forgot that the witchers are immune to poison? You shouldn't have run from Aretuza, you dunce. Ornella Vigo, you are under arrest in the name of the Lodge of Sorceresses. What the fuck is this? This is the book. Go! Get her! Fuck off. Impossible. Is that all? Your time has passed. - Kill 'im! - Come on! - Go! - Do it! - Get 'im! - Come on! He's a poor dancer! Kill the vermin! Finish him! The sword! I've been looking for it everywhere. Even in witchers' keeps. - Almost got him. - With emphasis on the 'almost' part. Than son of a bitch killed Vesemir and Eskel. You didn't let me have my revenge. Triss told me. You couldn't cast signs without it. It'll be of no use to you. - You can't read it by yourself. - You're gonna do it for me. Why are you so sure? Do you know, who I am? You're one of Alzur's experiments. The witchers were an experiment. In the very place where you sit Alzur used to test on me. And he created a mutant. That's why you hate them so much? Everyone seems to forget, when the first monster hunters came to being. Why do you need that book? I thought you have already figured it out. Knowledge is power, isn't it? You want to be perfected. I want you... to continue your research, Ornella Vigo. On me. Sir? Did you find them? We've searched the woods. Nothing. What are you doing here then? So that's what you want? Once you're done with the witchers... Will you also take care of the Priests of Eternal Fire? And then who? The wizards? As for my offer... you should sleep on it. We've got plenty of time. You're right. Knowledge is power. That wretched hag got you nasty, master. Not to worry though. I've already spoken with the elders. All are willing to pay even the Old miller, the one who lost his hand 'cause of that woman. I'll go fetch some water from the well. No one would've survived what Vesemir had done to him. Maybe he's a witcher. Don't make me laugh... there are various forms of mutations and witchers are no more. You've grown attached to being the "last one". It doesn't matter who he is. He can't get his hands on Ornella's research. The guilt rests on your shoulders. - Why didn't you tell me what she's up to? - Haven't you figured that out yet? Thought drowns in the memories stream still Be all ears, when the legend grows Of the Fourteenth Witch from the Hill Though her name is engraved in the Hill's stone - The Hill that time once held in contempt - Wait. The waves of war did not wash her away Her charm is still to be tempt. Impossible. Hello there, witcher. Dear sorceress. This time you went too far. You son of a whore! No! I'm begging you! Please, wait! You are looking for her, right? For Ornella? It just so happens that no one knows those ruins better than I do. I can help you. Sir... The sorceress wants to speak to you. I thought about your offer. I'm going to prove to you just how useful sorceresses can be. I'm going to need my hands for that. Bring Alzur's Almanac. Everything in it's own time. Take her to the dungeon. Did you find her? Not even a trace. I don't know how the fuck am I gonna tell the boss. My brother-in-law was right. About what? That no woman should ever touch a blade. You won't be saying that with your throat cut open. Like that midget, Chivay? - You still remember? - It's hard to forget that. You think that they're gonna make it? At least they won't get in our way. We've gotta get past them somehow... Now I'm gonna... - Are you daft? It's me, young master. - Don't do that again. - You'd prefer Mayor’s daughter, right? - Shut up. They won't back out from Verden. - I can't belive it. - What? That the old fucker Radovid is still breathin'. A bad thing never dies. - Whose side will you take? - His. He pays better. I'm supposed to lock him up with the witch. Upstairs then. And that brother-in-law was killed by some whore from Passiflora. Right, with a butterknife probably. That's funny, very funny. Don't get swindled so easily. Not this time. Charming, as always. I have to adapt. I will take care of them. Let's dance. You're not a witcher. Fight! M'lady? My apologies that it took so long. This time, I'm going to finish it. You did pretty well. As befits Pretty Kitty's son. Bullshit! Julia Abatemarco? You should've started with that, you idiot. - M'lady. - Do you have the Almanac? No, it's gone. It burned up. Or vanished. Ready? Would you also like to know if the bonds aren't too tight? The Lodge had been waiting long enough. Lambert, Lambert. I don't like goodbyes... Merigold. We’ll meet again. - Wait for me on Ard Skellige. - M’lady? Look to my coming on the fifth day after Saovine. - At dawn... - Look to the east? Is it always like that with the sorceresses? Now the legends about the White Wolf seem hardly surprising. Something ends, something begins. Perhaps you could teach me a thing or two? Grab it closer to ricasso. Use both hands. Maybe not right now. My one dream right now is a hot bath. And girls, huh? Girls in a hot bath! I haven't been beaten so badly in a long time. No worries. You’ll be fine ‘till the next wedding’s up. Yours by a chance? Your father-in-law awaits. Perhaps... we should look for another tavern? And some horses. My legs are sore as if I'd been in the Poor Fucking Infantry for a week!
