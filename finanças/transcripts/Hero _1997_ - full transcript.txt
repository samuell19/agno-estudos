In 1898, a drought broke out in Shandong province. People lived in great poverty. Hordes of refugees left their homes for better lives in Shanghai. Under the Shanghai International Settlement, Shanghai was controlled by the British and was a major trading port between foreign countries and China. The city of Shanghai was a place of luxury and dissipation. It was also where gangsters struggled for power. Among the local gangsters, Tam See and Yang Shuang were most powerful. Tam had the support of the British, Yang was backed by the local police. Each controlled a part of Shanghai. Dad used to say, "When one leaves home, he must carry seeds from home..." The train is coming. "If they blossom and bear fruits, one's career will proceed smoothly." What's wrong? I hope this jasmine will grow. The train is here! Do you think this jasmine... -Come on, follow me... -...will blossom some day? Come on! -Run... we must get on. -I will. Wing Jing! Where are you? Wing Jing! Where are you? Tai Cheung! Wing Jing! Wing Jing! Come on! We're finally leaving this god-forsaken place. We quit! Listen, northerners! Everyone needs a job in Shanghai. Plenty of people will take your jobs. You should be grateful I hired you. Who the hell do you think you are? -Shut up! -Yeah, shut up! I quit! We quit! Hey! Stand in line. Stand in line. I didn't see you yesterday. -Looking for a job? -I want a job with prospects. -Did you read the sign outside? -Yes. They're not promising at all. You're skinny and pale. What can you do? Baldy! Look at my hands. I can do what a few men can. I'm strong! On your back! See? So what if you're strong? You're still a coolie. Here's another sack for you. Why two sacks for me? What's wrong with you? -You're bullying migrant workers. -Move it! You! Hurry up! Hurry! I carried two sacks, you're paying me for one. Who gave you two? You're lucky I didn't dock your pay! Damn! Whose carriage is that? I overheard the others. Tam See owns it. He's the most powerful man in the Bund. He owns the dock. He left Shandong at 18 and came to Shanghai alone. In less than two years, he marked his turf. He's best known for getting rid of the Seven Tigers of Guangdong overnight, which made all the gangs wary of him. Another gangster Yang Shuang knew he was no match for him and collaborated with the local police. They're the only contenders for the Bund. Master Yang... If we get rid of Tam See, we'll rule the Bund. With the local police backing Yang Shuang, Tam See must be at a disadvantage. -Wrong! -Why? The local police backs Yang Shuang, but the British favor Tam See. The British? Tam See controls the dock to do business with the British. With the British behind him, the local police are useless in the Settlement. They wouldn't dare to touch Tam See. Don't touch! What is it? This blasted coolie touched Master Tam's horse. You damn coolie. How dare you touch the horse! Fix him! Hey! You have no right to call us that. People from Shandong are not to be messed with. -Do you know whose horse this is? -Definitely not yours! Fix him! What's your name? Ma Tai Cheung, aka Maradona. Who are you? People call me Tam See around here. Master Tam... I'm asking you. Ma Wing Jing. Judging from your accent, you from Shandong? You have the temper to match it. If you want to make a living in the Bund, remember not to quarrel over money. You want money? Pick it up if you want it. Since you like my carriage, you can clean it for me. I'll give you a silver dollar each time. Pick it up! Do you know how many sacks you have to carry for that dollar? If you don't think of yourself, think of your mother back home! Pick it up! Hurry up! You're such a loser, Ma Wing Jing. You bow your head over a dollar. Aim higher if you want to get rich. This watch is worth a lot more. I dare you to take it. That's robbery! That's how things are done in Shanghai. You're right! Remove your hand! Watch out! Do you know why I won't let you pick up the silver dollar? Why? Someone once told me, "If you refuse to get down on your knees, when you die and reincarnate, you'll become a man of noble stature." I don't want you to get down on your knees over a mere dollar. I'm giving you this watch. I'll get my own. You can keep yours, thanks. You're quite talented, but it's tough to make a living in the Bund. You can find me at Spring Lake. I'll do what I can to help you. He won! You're incredible! Amazing! -Let's go to Spring Lake. -Why? To enjoy the singing. I heard they have a great singer. We can't go dressed like this. I know a guy called Xiao Jiang-bei. He works backstage. -Maybe he can get you a job. -Job my foot! I hear business is good at Spring Lake. Spring Lake is managed by Tam See's mistress Yam Yeung Tien. The singer Kim Ling Tze is pretty and talented. It's always a full house. You're the 4 Kings of the Axe Gang, the most capable men in Shanghai. You'll find a way. You mean... Do what you have to, I want that club. Yes, sir. Sorry, Master Yang. Don't ruin the suits. I'll get fired if the supervisor finds out. We'll look around backstage. -They'll think we're staff. -Xiao Jaing-bei! -Don't go wandering around. -All right! Let's go! I knew you can't stand still. Life in Shanghai is so colorful. -This is for you! -Your hair is disgusting! You have no taste! Sit down! Let me go! You're hurting me! Let go, I'll stay. Sit down! My hand... This is Master Tam's club. So what? He can't watch you forever. We'll take over soon. Understand? I don't care if it's Tam See, Yang Shuang, or Kim Lao-qi before him. I paid for protection. Bloodsuckers like you are nobody. Master Fan. Yam Yeung Tien. Bullying a girl now? Run along, Lil' Kim. What is it, Madam Yam? I'm just flirting with the singer. You used to do that with Kim Lao-qi, but since Tam See gave you this club, this is suddenly beneath you. Tell your boss if he has the ability, he can snatch this from Tam See. I admire a capable man. Bitch. Can you help me? My kid is sick... Sure, go ahead. Thanks. Drop by my place after work. All right? That's so cheap! Don't touch her! What are you doing? Let me do it... You sell cigarettes here? Yes. And you? I'm new. I'm a musician. Do you know where Kim Ling Tze is? What time does she come on? Haven't you seen her? Her picture is out front... I came in through the back... I haven't met her. I heard she's an excellent singer. Men in Shanghai have fallen under her charm. You have a nice voice. You're very charming yourself. Too bad I don't have any money. Or else I'd buy all your cigarettes and let you get off work early. Smoking is not good for you. Don't worry, I'm good looking enough. Hey, who is he? Hey, don't come up, go down... What are you doing? Manager! Not bad! That's my brother! Tam See's men are here! Help me! Let's go! Run! Stop! Wing Jing! Wing Jing! You don't work for Tam See! I've never seen you before. Don't get me mixed up with Tam See. Why did you fight? I didn't start it. He hit my brother first! That's right! We're the 4 Kings of the Bund. We work for Master Yang. We're the Handsome Brothers from Shandong. What's your name? Where do you live? Ma Wing Jing. I stay at an inn if I can afford it. Otherwise I sleep on the street. I'll be back! Let's go. We're leaving? Look! He bloody broke my fingers in that punch. He's rather unusual. We have to tell the Boss. Let's go! Brother Ma... Hold this. You fought them off for us. Please accept this. Go ahead and spend it. I'll tell Master Tam. He knows me. Tell him I didn't do it for him. I did it for myself. I won't take his money. What's wrong with you? The kid doesn't appreciate favors. Says who? If I were in his shoes I wouldn't take the money either. Can you do me a favor? Anything. We didn't pay our way in here. One of the staff of Xiao Jaing-bei let us in through the back. Please go easy on him. I would really appreciate that. No problem! Consider it done! Let's go. How stupid! You should've given it to me. We could've spent it on a big meal, but you had to turn down the money. Don't you understand? I admire Tam See. I want to be like him. So, I can't take his money. I'll make my own. SONGSTRESS OF SHANGHAI: KIM LING TZE Such a pretty jasmine Such a pretty jasmine No other flower Can match its fragrance I would like to pick one But it would offend Its admirer I would like to pick one But I'm afraid That it won't bloom again SONGSTRESS OF SHANGHAI: KIM LING TZE Invite Tam See to the Green Lotus and apologize. Yang Shuang's men. You're asking for trouble! Damn! Yang Shuang has been in Shanghai all these years. He never dared to move in on my turf. He's up to no good. -Are you going to the Green Lotus? -Of course! Have someone check it out first. I will. -You don't spend the night anymore. -I already told you. You're not getting any younger. You should understand. Find a man and get married. What do you mean? People like me go to sleep at night and may not wake up the next day. We live on the edge. I can't afford to have a woman around. You manage my club, not my life. At least finish the pear. Can any woman in Shanghai make you stay? "So, the girl likes jasmine too." Listen to that song. It's full of emotions. I only know she's charming. Yes! She did charm me. Money is everything in Shanghai. Men around Kim Ling Tze are rich and powerful. Think about who you are! Yes, I need nice clothes. What does that mean? Robbery! Oh, my God! Forget God! We only want money. Put on your shoes! You're a singer. Going barefoot is so embarrassing. I bought you a pair of shoes so that you'll look prettier. Today is a lucky day. The marriage star is in the ascendant. Maybe it's the coolie. Don't even think about it! I brought you to the city so that you'd find a worthy husband. Now you fall for a coolie. What can I tell your mother? You came all the way to meet a coolie. I only met him once, I'm not marrying him. -I'm not that casual. -Casual? A Mr. Ma is looking for you. Come back! Give me back your shoes. Does he look a bit melancholy? He's not pretending. It comes from the heart. -Who are you? -We're secret agents. He's No. 2 and I'm No. 1. So... Look how his ears tremble and how his hair falls into place. Since he met you, he has become gaunt and sallow. If you want to know why, meet him tonight at the bridge and you'll find out! Bye! If you have a sister, you're welcome to bring her along. What a weird fashion sense! OK. I'm going to write to your mother! Come along! Uncle! It's done! What did you tell her? That we're government agents. You're No. 2 and I'm No. 1. That's how women are. She'll be intrigued by the suspense. They're curious creatures. You didn't have to say we're agents. You expect me to tell her we're nothing but coolies? Use your head! Where to? The bridge, please. Sure... Come back, Lil' Kim! Don't go to meet him! Come back! Grandma, why must I carry a red string on the first date? The first time I met your grandpa, my friends told me that if the red string can be tied at one go, the marriage will work. Government agents? Come here! Come over here! No! You'll hit me. I'll hit you whether you come over or not. -You have no heart! -I'm your brother! But you're a liar! How dare you... Her whole family is here? Your future father-in-law is a cop? Are they the robbers? Oh... My God. -Sign here! -I can't write, sign it for me. Just do it! -Listen up... -Captain! Tam See and Yang Shuang are meeting at the Green Lotus to discuss what happened at Spring Lake. The Commissioner wants Tam See taken care of. -Get ready... -Yes, sir. Hurry... Get changed and we'll put you in the cell. Here... Master Tam. We checked. Yang Shuang only brought the 4 Kings. Fu-sheng, come with me. Tiger, wait here with the rest of them. I want to come with you. Maybe I can help. Tiger, lately you seem to disagree with everything I say. Master Tam! You're both a singer and entertainer. These men are not to be trusted. He's not coming. You must be patient. Let's have a snack first. We must get out. Why? I overheard them. They'll ambush Tam See at the Green Lotus. I must warn him. Are you crazy? They're armed. How can we get out? Bring it here. Forget it! Give it to me! Think again! You can still turn back! Cut the crap! Or I'll hit you. I'm not giving it to you if you're ferocious. -All right, I won't, just give it to me. -I don't believe you. Trust me, give it! Be gentle. Fine. Sorry. I'll never yell at you again. Give it to me. I'll believe you this time. Under the table... Promise? Damn! Why did you give me a shoe? See? I knew it! Sorry... You're my brother. It hurts me to hit you. -Really? -Yes! I believe you! What are you doing? You were so nice. I don't want to hurt you. That's why I took the bullets out... You asshole! I must teach you a lesson! What are you doing? -Did my heart stop beating? -No. -Am I dead? -No. You passed the gun back and forth in front of me. Do you think I'm dead? xxx Have another bowl! And he'll be here... GREEN LOTUS RESTAURANT Master Tam, about last night... I don't know who caused the disruption at Spring Lake. I have always respected you. No matter what happens, justice will prevail today! Come here, Fan Gen! Which hand did you use? I... You better do it yourself. Boss... What goes around comes around. Go ahead, Master Tam. Ready the ax! Listen to me... I've been through a lot since I was 18. I'm not narrow-minded. I didn't come here to cause trouble. If I had... You wouldn't have even come through the front door. If you want to make it in Shanghai, stay off my turf! If you're willing to make friends, drink up and we'll start with a clean slate. You're right... Cheers! We'll lure them away and arrest Yang Shuang, and let Yang Shuang's men get rid of Tam See. What's going on? -What are you doing? -We're doing our job. Do you know Master Tam is having dinner with Master Yang? We're here to arrest them, and you! -Arrest them all! -Yes! This is outrageous! These local cops... We got word about your negotiation over the Spring Lake incident. You're wanted for questioning. -What for? -Shanghai is ruled by law. The local cops are not the supreme power. I'm friends with Mr. Lawson of Jardine. You better watch out! -Take him if you want. -Master Tam... Don't touch my men! Take them away! Move it... Tam See, I know about the guns you bought from the British. They're on their way here, and you're ready to deal next month. Don't let me catch you! Captain! Master Yang, I took care of Tam See's men. Thanks, Captain Zhao. I'll leave everything to you. That's not true! Everyone knows only cops carry guns. It's illegal to possess firearms. Don't be so cocky! You rely on the British and turn them against us. This is China. I'm telling you, they can't protect you forever. You better watch it! After you kill Tam See, the Bund will be ours. -Go! -Yes... Run, Master Tam. Don't move! Take it easy! Don't pee on my gun. About your breakout from the police station... I'll have the British take care of it. What is it you want in Shanghai? My brother wants you to look after us with lavish meals every day. Don't talk nonsense! What about you? My wish? My wish... is to retire with the woman I love and spend the rest of my life with her. Just one woman? You can have ten. Damn! I forgot! Take Master Tam home. He can't make up his mind. If you can't have him, you can have me. What can you do? I'm lucky! Want another bowl? We'll be eating breakfast soon. How come... You'll throw up if you cry... Don't do this! I'm sorry, I already did. My new shoes! I, Tam See, vow to wipe out every site Yang Shuang owns in Shanghai. Tam See destroyed my joints. You must try to stop him. End the trouble you've started. You should take care of it. Master Tam, Yang Shuang wants to meet with you. Being backed by the local police isn't everything. Stop dreaming! Tell the cops to talk to me. Two days ago, the police arrested your men and you were ambushed. It was an accident. This is between you and Yang Shuang. It has nothing to do with us. What do you want from me? We both know what's going on. Look at him... He took Yang Shuang the other day. Help me... -How dare you move in on my men! -The assassins are not local. You'll never find them. Accidents like these happen all the time. If you continue to back Yang Shuang and collaborate with them, such an accident can happen to you, too. You support Yang Shuang, I'll support someone else. Spring Lake is not my concern anymore. I'm giving it to Ma Wing Jing, but keep this in mind, you better pray nothing happens to him. If he goes out and gets run over by a car, or is killed by an unknown assassin, I'll hold you responsible. Master Tam thinks Ma Wing Jing can help you. Tell him... I'll take good care of Ma Wing Jing. Tell him not to worry. Excellent. I'll tell him. A coolie stood you up, but you must remain graceful. Uncle Feng, the Boss just fired you. -What? -Uncle... don't! Bloody hell! Don't bully my uncle! Wing Jing... Welcome. Take it easy! You don't have to apologize. Brother Ma! Brother Ma! We've been waiting for you. Master Tam gave you Spring Lake. This is the protection money. Please count it. I'll get my own turf. -I came to hear Kim Ling Tze. -Brother Ma! Brother Ma! She stopped working here. -She left Shanghai this morning. -What? Her uncle as well, they're not the same anymore. When she came to Shanghai last year, she was a little girl, now she's married. She went to Hangzhou to be Master Qian's mistress. We're very happy for her. The point of holding this job was to find a rich husband. She left word that if you dropped by today, she wanted me to sing on her behalf and send you her regards. Madam Yam hasn't sung in a long time. -Come on, sit over here. -Yes! Some say love Is grand and spectacular Even earth shaking Some say love Is nothing but a game That has no bounds To be in love It must be very personal Is it sweet Like mine? I'll give you anything you want I only want your love We'll play a spectacular Game of love You can... Can't sleep? The view from up here... Shanghai is beautiful. Now you understand why people in Shanghai are always climbing upwards. You can't see when you're down below. When you get higher up, you'll get a much better view than tonight. Spring Lake is nothing. It's just a flicker of light. There are thousands of Spring Lakes out there. Have you thought about that? I won't take anything from Tam See. Everything east of Spring Lake is his. Everything to the west belongs to Yang Shuang. There's a place nearby called Quan Fu Lane with casinos, brothels and underground banks. The daily collection fee amounts to 70 or 80 silver dollars. Why didn't anyone claim it? Someone did. Two months ago, Black Tiger tried... and he was found dead at the entrance. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Get the carriage! I'm going to Qun Fu Lane. No! You can't! It's too dangerous! Brother Ma... Wing Jing... Master Fan. How can I do business like this? I can stop you cold. Listen... starting next month, I want 30 more silver dollars. Otherwise, I'll have the cops wipe you out. Bastard! This is outrageous! What are we going to do? -What do you want, Ma Wing Jing? -I'm here to take over Qun Fu Lane. -You alone? -And my blade. You're asking for trouble. I'm not here to kill anyone, I just want my first turf in Shanghai. Those who have oppressed the people of Qun Fu Lane, I'll spare them if they leave a hand behind. Leave a hand? Over your dead body! Charge! Attack! Run... Leave your hand behind! Damn! Don't be scared! Kill him! Go ahead! Brother Ma! Left or right? -Brother Fan! -Kill him! Call the cops! Kill him! Don't forget. Let's go. One day, Ma Wing Jing will cough up everything he took from me, plus interest. We're not destined to be poor and bullied by the rich. We must work together and we'll rule the world. Ma Wing Jing! NINE DEAD, ELEVEN INJURED IN GANG FIGHT xxx Come back... We wanted her. xxx What is it? Open it and see for yourself. How pretty! Happy birthday... Mother... Ready... I want to take a picture with the horse. What's wrong with you? This horse works just fine. Happy birthday to you... Hey... That's awful... Do we get paid? Captain Zhao... I gave him those sites on purpose. What? After he wiped me out, he'll target the other five gangs. As long as you're willing, they'll be on my side and we'll have a three-way split of Shanghai: Ma Wing Jing, Tam See and us. Find someone to drive a wedge between them -and we'll profit in the process. -Find whom? Someone who hates Tam See. The jewelry came in from France. I can't decide. Choose them all. Even artificial jewelry looks real on Madam Yam. Don't humor me. What else have you got? Yang has a diamond necklace. Do you have the guts to take it? What are you saying? Master Yang says you know what's good for you. It's a gift from him. The police have joined forces with the five gangs. Mr. Lawson wants you to lay off Ma Wing Jing. The British will back you up. I see. Mr. Lawson knows you're an honorable man, but you should set aside personal feelings. After all, we must see the bigger picture. Good-bye! You took six sites from Yang Shuang. That's nothing compared to you, wiping out eight sites of the Seven Tigers of Guangdong. The rumors were exaggerated. It was a joint effort by all the gangs. I didn't do it alone. I only led the entourage. They were too eager for success, offending the other gangs. Just as the way you are now. You're in great danger. Danger? What danger? I don't suppose you'll join the others and gang up against us? Don't be stupid! We're brothers. I saved your life! I came here today to try to stop you. The sites you took from Yang Shuang also belong to the local cops. You've not only offended him but also the local police. You pissed off people on both sides of the law. I'm not scared of them. Don't do anything reckless. If we can't move in on Yang Shuang, shall we move in on you? What? It's very simple. When things were going well for you back then, what if someone stopped you? What would you think? That person must be worried that you'll take his turf someday. What are you saying? When I'm talking, you have no right to butt in. I'm giving him advice because he's my friend. What you're doing will kill him. What are you after, whore? Don't call her that! Anyone who has ever taken her clothes off would know. -Such a woman... -Stop it. She's my fiancée! It's nice to have a goal, but if you lose yourself, you're digging your own grave. Do as you see fit. -Don't blame him, Master Tam. -I won't. I finally understand... Your brother is not ambitious, but that woman is. Don't get mad! Let it go! I can't hold my tongue anymore. Master Tam has been kind to you. Have you no heart? -Get out! -No! Who do you think you are? Even the men who've seen you through thick or thin think you have become a fool. I'm your brother, yet I need to go through this woman to talk to you. Why do you listen to her? Wake up! Get lost if you're not happy! Don't ever come back! You never really hit me before, but this time, you really mean it. How could you! Still awake? You're mad at me, right? You drove your brother away. I didn't say anything. Shut up and go to bed! Don't talk to me like that. -Is it because of Tam See? -What? You're the reason we argued. Then I'll go apologize. I'll do it now. Come back! Where are you going? Come back! -Come back right now! -What is it, Brother Ma? It's none of your business! Get lost! Go on! Move it! You're up against me, too! -Kill him! -Yes, sir! Get up! Don't die! Ma Wing Jing, you don't own the Bund. All the gangs are here tonight. You're dead! People like you will meet the same fate. You whore! At a time like this, you must have no mercy. Don't worry. I feel nothing for this man. Master Tam, Ma Wing Jing is in trouble. Why are you here, Mr. Lawson? Why? Tiger sent for me. Stay back! I'm just the messenger. It wasn't my idea. Master Yang. Good work, Tiger. Ma Wing Jing is dead and so is your British friend. The other gangsters are on Yang Shuang's side. You're on your own. I could have stayed with you... but you didn't want me. Do you regret it now? Ma Wing Jing should regret it, not me. He should've followed my footsteps and dumped you. If you get down on your knees, I may spare you. -Never! -Kneel! Such integrity! Tam See! Yang Shuang! You promised you won't hurt him if I helped you get rid of Ma Wing Jing. I'll take over his turf. I guarantee he won't oppose you. He promised me -he won't hurt you, Tam See! -Damn! Let him go! We'll leave Shanghai. I swear. We'll never come back! -You really need this man? -Yes! Fine! I'll give you a few more. -Fan Gen! -Yes, Boss? It's your lucky day! No... No! Don't worry, I won't kill you. I need your connections. You killed Lawson tonight. I caught you and handed you over to the police. Isn't that brilliant? The other gangs are not blind. You're right! Yang Shuang! Don't get cocky, bitch! Help him! Hand me a cloth! Hurry! Don't let him move! Hand me a cloth! I've taken care of the other gangs. Only the old geezers from the Commerce Chamber will object to your becoming Chairman. I've wiped out the other gangs. If they start any trouble, finish them off for me. Yes, Boss. He's stabilized. I never thought that this boat would save both your lives. Except you jumped in yourself and he was thrown in. I'll kill you, bitch! Next time, he won't be so lucky. How is he? He's thinking about revenge even in his dreams. He'll plan a comeback once he gets ashore. We'll have to change his mind. How? We'll lie to him. Make him believe life is full of surprises and he shouldn't keep hating. What shall we tell him? Stop speaking at the same time for god's sake. Why are we here? We were fishing and fished you from the river. Fishing? Your turn! -My nickname is Fisherman King. -Fisherman King? Yes, they got married six months ago. I've been out six months? So much has changed. When we reach Huangpu River, let's stop by Spring Lake Department Store and get a new net. Department store? Yes! Qun Fu Lane is now a museum. Master Tam gave up his turf and turned them into amusement parks. Where is he? He's now a school principal. What are you saying? We're just bluffing anyway. He's into education these days. All his men have become his students. The mistakes they made are now cautionary examples. They don't call him Master Tam anymore. He's now Principal Tam. Yam Yeung Tien has changed, too. How? She's now a nun, repenting her sins. Her nickname is Sister Heartless. She spent six months perfecting a trick called Grab the Money. That's absurd. Wait till you hear about Yang Shuang. What happened to him? He's now a singer. With his magnetic voice, he joined a dancing troupe to educate the young people so that they won't go astray. He composed songs and lyrics and won the New Talent Award at the Shanghai Music Festival. But from what I last heard, at his concert in Heilongjiang, he was trampled to death. They have turned over a new leaf. What's so funny? Nothing! It's your brother. He almost joined the national athlete team. -Are we exaggerating a bit? -A little. Master Yang. Please stay! Thanks! Get the carriage! Don't worry, Master Yang. You'll chair the Chamber of Commerce. Don't worry about those old fools. We'll buy them in at the inaugural ceremony. All the businessmen in Shanghai won't dare to oppose us. -Long time no see, Mr. Fan. -Get lost! Go to hell! That bitch got what she deserves! Why did you marry my brother? Maybe because he's not a gangster. A woman doesn't want to worry every day about when her husband will be killed. If I don't get involved in gangs anymore, will you marry me? Move your leg! -What are you doing? -I don't know! He kissed me while I was asleep. Not you, I was kissing her... No, him. -Why did you kiss me? -I don't know! I was dreaming. Beast! Stop day-dreaming, asshole! Don't take it out on me! Will the boat go down? What? You want to kiss me again? I told you I was dreaming! I didn't mean it. Of course you meant it. Yes, I did it on purpose! What? Nothing! Damn! A woman gave you this. Next time, it's my turn! Despite the scar on her face, she still has a nice body. Smells good! I'll move these things. I'll eat it later. I'll save you a bowl! Let me do it. I'm glad you're nice to my brother. What's so funny? Who did you kiss in your dream? Your brother and I... Yam Yeung Tien! I can't blame her for everything. She was my fiancée. She won't hurt me. I know you want to talk to her. We'll be back in Huangpu River soon. Don't keep my photo. Don't let her see it. I have to go. After everything we did, he still won't stay. I disagree. The past two weeks he spent with us were probably the most peaceful days he had in Shanghai. If the fish belongs to the sea, he'll find his way back. Let's hope he won't get caught. Lil' Kim. Hey. I'm not leaving. Where's your wife? What wife? We lied about getting married. She left! Come with me! Of all the birthdays she had, this one was the best. -Today is her birthday? -Yes. I must get her a present. Both of you want to take advantage of me! Who do you think you are? BIN JIANG PIER I went to the French department store and bought you a handkerchief for your birthday. You know French? No! I pointed. Thanks, Brother Cheung! Soon I'll be brother-in-law. This is a strange handkerchief. It's an imported one, maybe that's why. I see! It's for lovers. Hold this! Hold it! You blow your nose together. Right... When it gets windy, you can tie up your hair so it won't be a mess. Nice! I don't think so. Give it here! You use it to carry food. It'll keep food warm in the winter. Right... I'm not sure what it's for. But when I see it, my heart starts pounding. That's impossible! Who is it? Stop! Come back! Let go... Let go of me! It's not my fault. Don't stare at me! It's not my fault! Trust me! It's really not my fault! Kill that bitch, Wing Jing! Brother Tai Cheung! Let me go! I had no choice. Go now, I don't want to see you again! Thanks! Master Tam... What? He'll be executed tomorrow? He went to Fuzhou Road to save you. They had him arrested. I have to go. Giving her a chance... is giving me a chance. THE WORLD OF YANG SHUANG Watch your step, Boss! Congratulations, Boss! Master Yang! Congratulations! You'll rule Shanghai. I came here to tell you... Ma Wing Jing is still alive. -If you let Tam See go... -What? ...I'll tell you where Ma Wing Jing is. Fine! If I catch him, I'll set Tam See free. Don't lie to me again! I'll die a horrible death if I do. We have a deal! -Don't worry! -I'll go with Fan Gen. You'll let Tam See go, Boss? Tell Fan Gen to bring a gun and kill Ma Wing Jing and this woman. You can't go! That's suicide! I can't let them kill Tam See. I have to go! Don't follow me! Wing Jing... I told you not to trust that bitch! See? You bastards shot Lawson and framed Tam See. That's right! But those British pigs are grateful to Master Yang for arresting Tam See. -But I'm not the murderer. -He did it. That's right! I did it. I'll kill you today for Master Yang. Now I understand. You killed Lawson. It's a trap! Don't move! Go! Thank you for letting us know the truth. Don't thank me, thank her. OFFICIATING CEREMONY OF MAYOR YANG Tell Master Tam's men to head for the execution ground. I'm very honored to have your support. I'm not from Shanghai, but I've been doing business here for 20 years. Shanghai is my second home. These two cannons are from the local police. Let's see how long he can keep his seat. The red packet is within the backdrop. Mr. Yang will assume office after the ceremony. Begin the lion dance. TAM SEE Ma Wing Jing, you're causing trouble by holding a funeral procession now. I want justice for Master Tam. The British already know Master Tam didn't kill Lawson. It was you, Yang Shuang and the local police. The police won't do anything illegal. Unifying Shanghai was Master Tam's dream. I made a pledge to help him realize that dream. He should be the Chairman. Tell him to come get it! Carry Master Tam to the stage. Yes! You won't get past me and the firing squad. Let alone the red packet. Stop dreaming! You're overrating your ability. We owe Master Tam great favors. Our lives will serve as presents for Master Tam's inauguration. Fire! You'll kill my men! Spread out. -I'll fire if you come any closer. -How dare you! I'll shoot you. Then I'll kill you first. Watch out! Light the dynamite! Get up there! Charge. -Put the coffin up there. -Yes! Take the seal first. Don't move! You think Master Tam is dead? Fan Gen died in his place. Come back! Muscle spasms! Up the bridge. -Toss me the lion head. -OK! Catch! -Brother Ma! -Wing Jing! Tai Cheung! Yang Shuang! Are you all right? Come back! Brother Ma! Watch out, Master Tam. Go to hell! Only one of us will come out alive. Watch out! Don't let me fall! Do me one last favor. Give this to Yam Yeung Tien. Master Tam! Let's go! She's not coming. She loves Master Tam, she'll be here. He's been dead a month. What does she want? Everyone in Shanghai is looking for you! Let's go! -Hurry! The train is leaving! -Hurry! Let's go. Go on! Hurry! GANGS OPEN FIGHT OVER TURF AFTER TAM SEE'S DEATH You heard about Master Tam? I'm leaving Shanghai today. Before he died, he wanted me to give you this. He said the luckiest day of his life was the night you gave him the pear. Take care! If we can start over, I hope it's tonight. Thank you! Thank you! I don't know what's written on that handkerchief, but judging from her reaction, Master Tam must've forgiven her. It was dusk when I left Shanghai. Huangpu River looked like a gold ingot that everyone wanted, even at the expense of their lives.
