It still fits. For cryin' out loud! Are you Sam Kimura? That's the name on the buzzer. What do you want? Sorry, I didn't expect you in uniform. Every Pearl Harbor Day, they drop me out to prove I'm still alive. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your sister passed away. I'm the executor of her estate. She wanted you to have this. I haven't seen Kei in over 50 years! I don't want anything from her. What's in it? I don't know. A chance for forgiveness After all these years gone by The service is at three, First Presbyterian on Knob Hill. You're finally at peace, Kei. Couldn't you leave me that way too? If I were at peace, I wouldn't be here. Come back, remember when Open the gates, Sam Back to a time that no one speaks of anymore Remember? I don't want to relive all that. You must return again See what awaits, Sam We used to be a family in those days before We were broken by the war By the war We can still get back what we lost. Look at yourself, Sam. I'm not that kid anymore. Welcome home, Sammy! Hey, thanks! Sammy! Oh, Sis! Oh, I can't believe it! My little brother, our first college graduate. Ow! Why didn't you call from the station? I rode down with a buddy as far as San Jose. From there, I hitched. I wish you wouldn't do that. I wish you'd stop nagging. Are you hungry? Always. Tatsuo, I'll take 10 bushels of artichokes. Thank you, you do us honor. Papa, look who's back from college! Good! Now, we need 10 bushels. Home, sweet home. It can wait. Right now, we're having a party. Won't you join us? What's the occasion? Japanese Summer Festival. At this time each year, as we celebrate the harvest We hang a wish high upon a wishing tree If the wind's strong enough To collect your wish and take it Tradition says that the wish will come to be Once again, I make a wish to honor the memory of your mother. What's it say? If you studied Japanese, you would know. For my daughter, a husband. For my son-- Let me guess, law school. I would settle for respect. This time of year always makes me think of Mama She loved this day, though her wishes were few She was the heartbeat of every celebration You know, that sounds a lot like you Then maybe wishes do come true Wishes on the wind Drifting through the night Connecting friends and family As they float away from sight Wishes on the wind Are wishes that we share Not only for ourselves, but for the ones we love Who will always be there Oh! This came for you. I already know what it says. Me too, I opened it. Kei. When are you gonna tell Papa? Later, I don't want to spoil the party. Keiko, where is your grandfather? You have eyes, look before ask! Ojii-chan! So, what is your wish, Ojii-chan? I wish not to hold this anymore. For my sister, I wish for a cottage by the ocean A quiet place that's entirely her own For my brother, I wish for great journeys and adventures To see the world till he finally misses home I wish that I didn't have to play the good son Waste years in school just so Pop would think I'm smart I wish that I didn't have to play the mother Though it would tear Papa apart I've got to make a brand new start Wishes on the wind Dreams that touch the sky Our heads are bowed, our eyes are lifted Hope is riding high Wishes on the wind And though they travel far Somehow, some day, they'll find their way Right back to us Right back to us New dreams with new mysteries Some day, I'll unravel them New roads with new histories Some day, I will travel them I will travel them Wishes on the wind Dreams that touch the sky Our heads are bowed, our eyes are lifted Hope is riding high Wishes on the wind And though they travel far Somehow, some day, they'll find their way Right back to us Right back to us Right back to us Wherever we are So Sammy, what do you college fellas think, will America join the war? We have to, France and England need us. You gonna enlist if we do? Of course! You fought in the last war, didn't you? Eh, I got the scars to prove it. Um, Sammy? What? We'll get your order of artichokes to you first thing tomorrow. Thanks, Kei. See you, Sam. So, Isamu you get letter from law school? Perhaps I expected too much from you. You know, Pop, I've been thinking, maybe I'm not cut out for law! Let's face it, Kei was the A-student. A-minus. A-minus. I grow this land from nothing so you can go to school, make a better life in this country. But what if I don't want to-- Honor what you started, Isamu. You will study harder and apply again. Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. I ask that the Congress declare a state of war. This will not be good for us. During Great War, people in Salinas tried to kill a German shopkeeper. They burned his store to ground. We must keep our heads down. Where are you going? To hang up our flag! They need to know we're loyal Americans. You'll just draw attention to us. It's not safe. Nothing can be done, so for now, we do nothing! You can't be serious! Pop, look We're at war now We've been attacked, don't you see We have to take a stand We must wait and see! I can't be hearing this We've got to act now, not wait for angry crowds To burn our farmhouse down Let's show everyone in town Do not fight the storm Do not fight the storm Better to bend and submit The nail that is highest is hit Do not fight the storm Do not fight the storm There's nothing that we can do That's not true. We're here to enlist. Sorry, fellas, the army has classified all Japanese 4C, enemy aliens. But we were born in California. We've never even been to Japan. A Jap is a Jap. We came to serve today Just like the others We want to be the first to wave the red, white, and blue Somehow, we'll find a way This isn't right We are Americans There's nothing to discuss Then who will speak for us Do not fight the storm This is Mike Masaoka, national secretary for the Japanese American Citizens League. The JACL? Who put them in charge? We Americans of Japanese descent pledge to fight Japan until the enemies of freedom are destroyed. The JACL asks that everyone remain calm and trust in the fairness of the American way. Kaito Kimura? I'm Kei Kimura. Kaito's my grandfather. What can we do for you? FBI. We have some questions for him. In a time of war, it is necessary to forego some civil liberties to keep America safe. Kaito Kimura, do you correspond with Japanese nationals currently living in Imperial Japan? Does he understand? Governor, the JACL strongly opposes evacuating our people from their homes! There must be another way to guarantee our loyalty! Do not fight the storm Do not fight the storm By order of President Roosevelt, all people of Japanese ancestry have until Friday to evacuate the West Coast. The government will transport you to a relocation center. Take only what you can carry. How can we go and where will they take us We cannot say no, cannot fight the storm Bend like a reed and the wind won't break us How can we go Do not fight the storm We leave without bitterness, for it is patriotic to make this sacrifice. Sacrifice. I'll take the farm, the house, the equipment, - and the car for $2,000. - Sacrifice. - But it's worth $20,000. - Sacrifice. That's a lot more than your neighbors are getting. Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice! Let this relocation be our contribution to the war effort! Do not fight the storm What can we do The world never hears the cries of a few! Do not fight the storm Do not fight the storm Nothing that we can do The world is not as we knew So keep your head down till the storm Passes through We've known each other for 20 years! Two grand, take it or leave it. We leave our homes with smiling faces, grateful to be wards of our government in this troubled time. Where they take us? The tag says Heart Mountain, Mrs. Tanaka. You can't take the carriage, ma'am. What? Baggage only. Wishes on the wind, wishes on the wind And though they travel far, travel far Attention all personnel, evacuees have arrived at the main gate. All staff assigned to orientation detail should report to their post to process new arrivals. Security staff, report to your stations, armed and ready. Where are we? Wyoming? I not ask why, I ask where. This place is called Heart Mountain. You see, the mountaintop? It's shaped like a heart. All new evacuees must proceed to the infirmary for medical examinations. Women to the right, men to the left! Oh, excuse me, could I please have some water for my grandfather? Women to the right, men to the left! Here, for your grandfather. Thank you. Hey, you're even. I beg your pardon? The number on your tag, it's even. I'm odd. Women to the right, men to the left. Please prepare to remove your clothes, down to your underwear, for medical examinations. You will all need to remove your clothes. Mom, Mom, Mom! These women can't undress in front of everybody! It's not right! Shut up! Now, please go inside and remove your clothes. After sundown, anyone using the latrines must follow marked pathways. Camp guards have orders to enforce this policy strictly. The dust is coming right through those cracks in the wall. There's no running water. I survived San Francisco earthquake, run farm in Depression. We will make do. Make do? They're treating us like animals! Isamu. Gaman. Gaman? It means to carry on. Hold head high. Hey, where are we gonna eat? With the others in the mess hall. Dinner is family time, not a social time. We will eat as family. Where is washroom? There's a latrine next to the infirmary, Mama. We share it with everybody else. I no understand. And there are no walls between the toilets. No wall? There are people all around you. I cannot do! I want to go home! Please! I want to go home! It will all be all right There's a way through this night Stay strong On this long road We bury our pain There's a word we will say To help get through each day We will bear any nightmare With a simple refrain Gaman Gaman Sturdy and sure Keep faith and endure Gaman Gaman Hold your head high, carry on Gaman Dearest wife up on high Looking down, see how I am lost And exhausted, weak, and ashamed Little baby, don't cry Hear a sweet lullaby Have I failed to protect you Am I to blame We know that there's no turning back Gaman If we hold together There's nothing we lack And our people will know That wherever we go Together we'll ever remain Gaman Gaman Sturdy and sure Keep faith and endure We will carry on Gaman Dignity, pride As we stand side by side Even when all hope seems gone Gaman Gaman Gaman What are you doin', old man? He's just hanging wind chimes. Come again? We bring from Japan. Take it down! It's just a-- It's just what? It's just, with your permission, we'd like to hang this up. Now we're talking. Thank you, sir. Isamu! What? You dishonor Grandfather! He was protecting him! He calls attention to us! He must know his place! My place is in the army! I can't sit around here doing nothing, I'll go nuts. Then make yourself useful. That's what I'm trying to do, Pop-- No! You are trying to be big man! Look, I-- Think Isamu! Then do. I need some air. Flag look like America, sound like Japan! "Don't fight the storm," he said And now look where we are Bending and cowering Can only get you so far He tells me to make myself useful And do our family proud Well, how the hell am I supposed to be useful When being myself's not allowed He clings to tradition, afraid to try something new "We don't call attention, we think," but we never do He wants me to follow blindly He wants me to keep my mouth shut But I swear from this day forward I am going with my gut What makes a man is his clarity When he listens to his heart What makes a man is his bravery When he plays a bigger part What makes a man is what he makes of himself When he's doing the best he can I must be my own man It's time we took action And found a way out of this place I'll set an example Help others to see beyond race And though my face resembles our enemies in war I am still American Nothing less and nothing more I'll never be a scholar Much as Pop wants me to be And I'm not some nameless body in a crowd If Pop would only see the soldier I could be I'll finally find a way to make him proud I'll finally find a way to make me proud What makes a man is his dignity When he stands for what is right What makes a man is his loyalty When he fights his nation's fight What makes a man is what he makes of himself When he's giving it all he can For all our sakes I'll do what it takes I must be my Own man Hey! Break it up! Just doing karate. None of that oriental crap. Kimura-san. Konnichiwa. Oh! Mr. Odd. Frankie. Suzuki-san. No. No? Sorry. Crap! Your place is better than mine. I'm stuck in a room with 10 other single fellas. Makes my apartment in L.A. look like paradise. I've always wanted to visit Los Angeles. It's very glamorous, poolside parties, nightclubbing with movie stars. Really? No. I'm in law school at USC. Well, was. And your family? Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry. My folks ran a Japanese language school. The day after Pearl Harbor, they got arrested. I haven't seen or heard from them since. I'm sure they're fine. I'm not. Would you like to join us for supper in the mess hall? You buyin'? Ojii-chan, are you ready to go? Yes! Thank you, Private. Oh, you'll get used to the dust. You sure? I'm from Nebraska, dust is a food group. Oh, here. This'll help. You wanna listen to my chest? Oh, uh, no. You're dismissed. Oh, um, how can I help you? My grandfather's got a cough that won't quit-- I'm sorry, I don't have anything, I-- Hey, what about-- That's for military personnel only. Right. Rules are rules. Hmm. But if you need rubbing alcohol, bandages, or cotton balls, I'm your gal. Oh, good to know, Nurse-- Campbell. Hannah. Kimura, Sammy. Listen, if your grandfather gets worse-- Have him take two cotton balls and call you in the morning? Oh. You know, I tried to enlist. You did, huh? Got rejected. Flat feet? Yellow face. Ah. So, I would have been military personnel. But you're not. No, but if I were, I could get cough syrup for my grandfather? But you can't. Mm, no, you can. They told me the Japanese were quiet Wouldn't put up a fuss She probably likes to have the power over all of us Been standin' a minute here already She is under my skin I should just throw him out I need an angle in Hey, come on, I'd do it for your grandfather! My grandfather's dead. So that just leaves mine. Hello! Do you please have a poison? Oh, oh, to kill rat. Oh, try the camp kitchen. Yes, thank you. Camp food kill anything. Oh! Now we're standing far too close He's certainly stubborn, have to give him that I can wait this out all day I won't be leaving till I get what I want Why are we in here alone But if she gets in trouble, I'll feel bad I should just be on my way I oughta, I oughta, I oughta, I oughta I oughta get going I gotta get back to work Before I go You gotta get out I'm gonna come back to see ya just so you know There's something exasperating and I oughta tell him so He oughta I don't wanna, but I oughta Guess I oughta, just gotta I oughta go I should get back to my grandfather if you're not-- No, wait, wait! Don't tell anyone. Oh, thanks. Bye! She's not half bad What'd I just do Oughta go Excuse me, is this the Wartime Relocation Office? Mr. Masaoka, I'm Director Dillon. How's Washington treating you? Well, all I've seen so far are a lot of secretaries telling me that the congressman isn't available. Be patient. We've got 10,000 people still being held at Santa Anita Racetrack-- I know. And at Heart Mountain, They've got dust storms-- I know. I'm working on a statement for the press. Here you go! With all due respect, I can't say this! It's for the good of your people. America needs to know they're not the enemy. Gentlemen of the press, our people are not prisoners! They live in clean pioneer communities. They take part in wholesome activities, like the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, and Americanization classes. The American people can sleep well at night knowing that Uncle Sam is a benevolent master. Yes, operator, I'll accept the charges. Mike? Ben, where are you? We're still at the racetrack. We're sleeping in a horse stall. Our mother is sleeping in a horse stall. I'm sorry, I'm doing everything I can. Do more. Listen, I think I can get the army to let us enlist. What the hell good's that gonna do? It'll prove that we're loyal, just like any other American! Right just like any other American. Hey, Tom, how's that college degree workin' out for ya, huh? I still got plans. You got nothin' but junk. We'll get all this cleaned up. What's the point? The next dust storm will bury us again. I started a petition for the camp administrators. You mean wardens? I have a list of requests to make life better here. Now, what do you want? It's already cold at night, we need blankets, we need medicine. I've got a mattress full of fleas. Can your petition fix that? Here! Smell like pee! They brought us here, forgot about us, and left us to rot. That is not gonna happen. Yeah, we're at war with Italy, but nobody's putting Joe DiMaggio in a camp! Look, I, hey! Hey! If you got a complaint, put it here! Just sign this! And remind the folks in charge that there are people here We must appear united! If you want aspirin or bedding without fleas Or not to freeze Then get organized with me As a team, we'll get it done We're not nearly finished here, we have only just begun So sign this! It's time we got in the game We just gotta get in, gotta get in, gotta get in Gotta get in the game We can't sit on the sidelines. Decisions should be made by the elders. Only American citizens can be in charge, Pop. Since we come here, young people run wild like coyote! Look, look, look, I'm sayin': That we gotta get in, gotta get in, gotta get in Gotta get in the game We're stuck, who knows how long, and sure, it's wrong Alone, it's really hard, but as a team, we're strong There's no use placing blame We just gotta get in the game It's more than just the basics. We have to find a way to make life livable here. No, no, enjoyable! Fun, even. Fun? This is not summer camp. We need something we can all do together, something we all like! Mrs. Tanaka, what is it that you miss most about home? Garden! Back home, I have so many flower-- And vegetable! Here, ground too hard! You head too hard! Jodo! Uh-uh, that is against the rules! No oriental crap allowed, remember? That's why we're petitioning. Fight! Whoa! Dancing! We can use the mess hall! Yeah, jazz it up! Sumo! We need something we can all do! We need Buddhist temple. We need Frank Sinatra records! Hey! What about baseball? Ah! Gotta get in, gotta get in, gotta get in Gotta get in, gotta get in, gotta get in Gotta get in, we gotta get in, we gotta get in Gotta get in, we gotta get in, we gotta get in Gotta get in the game It's a beautiful day for baseball here Block 13 up at bat, gotta get in The bases fully loaded and two outs is where we're at Gotta get in, gotta get in Gotta get in the game Strike one Gotta get in, gotta get in the game Strike two Toes at the plate, toes at the plate Hands up high, hands up high Eyes on the ball, eyes on the ball Knock 'em to the sky, knock 'em to the sky Now, everyone get in Home run That's how we win So we gotta get in Gotta get in the game Gotta get in Gotta get in the game We're stuck, who knows how long, and sure, it's wrong Alone, it's really hard, but as a team, we're strong There's no use placing blame It's time we overcame And got back In the Game Gotta get in the game Would you help me out? Yeah. Oh, Mrs. Maruyama, you were fantastic! You should call the games! Call them what? No, it's what an umpire does. It's like a judge. Oh, she like to judge! Oh, don't forget about the fleas! Got it. Oh, Nurse Campbell, I could use your help. I need some body bags, lots of body bags. Oh, are you planning a massacre? No, I'm just kid, I wasn't-- Oh, no, no, never, gosh, no. No! Oh, gosh, you said-- No, no, no, they're for mattresses. You stuff them with straw, they don't rot or smell. Oh, clever. Sam. Huh? Oh, this is my sister. Kei, this is Nurse Campbell. Hannah. That means flower in Japanese. It's pronounced ha-na. It's close. Not really. Hey, Pop, what do you think, huh? Suzuki-san! That Frankie gives me the itch. I'll bet Nurse Hannah could help with that. Her temperature is 102. You need to keep her inside and cool. Do you have any aspirin? I'm sorry, check back tomorrow. There you go. Thank you, Sam. What else do you need? Can you get me medical supplies for thousands of people? I can check to see if the trucks are here. Good enough. Yeah. Sam. Hmm? I really appreciate your help. I'm sorry, Mr. Kimura, I don't have anything more for you. Nothing at all? Make sure he drinks plenty of water. The water is making him sick! I filed a report. Really, I'm doing everything I can. This is all they got. Hey! What do you think you're doin'? I asked Sammy to get the supplies. Sammy? Well, it's a good thing you're a nurse, 'cause it looks like you got yellow fever. Don't be ignorant. That's not really how-- I can handle this. I'm talking to you. Come on, back off, she-- Remember who gives the orders around here! That won't be necessary, Private! He knows his place. So should you. What the hell is his problem? Have you lost your mind? Don't lecture me, sis. Don't let him use this. He coulda shot you, Sam! He was just trying-- Stay out of this! Look, I am on your side! Then leave us alone! It's safer that way! Hannah, don't listen to her. Sammy! No, no, she's right. You need to go. Now! There's a line between should and shouldn't And I never have crossed it Tried to hold myself back, but I couldn't I used to have judgement, how could I have lost it I've been willfully playing with fire Now it's drawing me in With no net and walking on wire How could I let him sink under my skin But the rule is stay far from him Still, my heart skips a beat Life in here may be sink or swim But he makes it strangely sweet There's a line between should and shouldn't But it's starting to vanish If I could let this go, I wouldn't No one can tell me which feelings to banish Rules are rules They always apply I follow the rules But should I Should I Rules are rules But I don't know why I follow the rules I follow the rules But should I Should I Should I Should I This is the third time that I've submitted this petition from Heart Mountain! It's 20 below in Wyoming! They need coal, they need blankets, they-- Who doesn't? There's a war on. Then let our boys enlist! Mike, I've told you before. Give us our own segregated unit, like the Negroes. We'll fight harder than any soldier you've got. We'll undertake the most dangerous missions, even if it means certain death. Certain death, you mean a suicide battalion? Think of the headlines! No one cares about one dead Japanese American. Spread us out and the story disappears. But hundreds of casualties at once? Hundreds of Japanese American heroes, sacrificing their lives. That could change the way this country thinks of us. Your people would do that, you'd do that? If that's what it takes to win back our freedom, it's a price we're willing to pay. But there's no way of knowing which of your people are loyal. We separate the troublemakers from the rest. How do we do that? Questionnaire? What is questionnaire? The government wants more information about us. We live inside the fence, use public toilet. What they not know? Whether we've been convicted of a crime? Are we willing to serve in the armed forces? What? Question number 27. Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty wherever ordered? They're letting us serve! No, it's too dangerous. So we can't live free in this country, but we can die for it? Isn't freedom worth dying for? You would put on same uniform as soldiers who point guns at us? We're all Americans! Listen to this. Question number 28-- Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America-- And forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese emperor? They lock us up then ask for loyalty? We all still have to say yes. No! This time, they go too far! That piece of paper there It is an outrage So many tens of thousand lives destroyed for what Pop, they could deport you back to Japan! They call it questionnaire They took our farm, they took our home And now our honor is at stake But that, they'll never take Never take Allegiance You will not serve unless they force you in their army! Our army! We look like enemy! They see disloyal, let them accuse me or deport me If they wish They talk of liberty All empty words They promise justice for our people Look around We are dead upon the ground, look around Pop, I have a chance to defend my country! I'm taking it! No! Sammy! You can't just run off-- Calm down, there's a dance at the mess hall! How can you go to a dance? I organized it! This is no time for fun! Well, we need it, for morale. Should my allegiance lie first with my family I've got to calm them, make them listen If I refuse to bow, will I harm them instead He took a stand, there's a time to take mine If I go through with this I may never see them again If I deny myself What kind of man am I Papa! Some day, you'll understand The path I've chosen Today I answer no and no to set my conscience free My allegiance must lie first With me They're both so stubborn! No worry. But if Papa answers no and no-- He cannot. I take his questionnaire. What about Sammy? We can't let him sign up. Keiko, always think of other. When you mommy die, you grow up so fast, take care Sammy, help with farm. Why you no go to dance, have fun? Do American boogie-woogie. That's for kids. No one wants to dance with an old maid. You crazy! How you can be old maid when I still so young? Japanese say. A pretty lady? Should not sit home with old man on Saturday night. That's not a proverb. No, but should be. Listen to Ojii-chan. Keiko look at page Paper very bad Now, I look at Keiko, see how Keiko very sad But paper also change I fold it up this way A paper flower blossom Just like Kei Nothing blooms at Heart Mountain. You want bet? Two dollar say I make garden grow in hard ground. You're on. You gonna lose. You know why? Let me guess. Japanese say " Ishi Kara Ishi". Mountain can be moved. Stone by stone. Ishi Kara Ishi. Yamawa Ido Dekiru. Yasahii Ogawawa Tanima Wo Horeru, Horeru These are trick questions. We're damned if we answer yes and we're damned if we don't. I hear if you answer no and no, they send you away to Tule Lake. What's Tule Lake? Hard labor camp. I blame Masaoka. He's trying to get us to fight. I'd rather be on a battlefield than in a labor camp! You would fight for a country that lock up your parents? If we prove we're loyal, they'll free the others first, right? I don't think so. Do we answer yes or no? No, no, we wait and see. Shikataganai. Hey, Frankie, what are you gonna do about this questionnaire, huh? You want to find out? Come to the dance. Ladies and gentlemen, and all the ships at sea, you're listening to Charlie Howard and the Starlight Orchestra. I cannot be with you Though it breaks my heart A world at war divides us And so darling, we remain apart But when I close my eyes It's only you I see You're in my arms and once again You're dancing here with me With you, I'd be better With you, I'd be true We'd be together Your kiss is overdue For now, I am lonely My heart is blue With you With you I cannot be with you Your partner's a little stiff. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's kind of a drip. Oh, that's good, drip, yeah, I like it. What am I doing? Why aren't you at the dance? I'm on my way. Okay, you need to go. What if I were sick? Oh, are you? Yeah, sick of this place. Me too. Hey, you think enlisting's a good idea, don't you? Of course. I just want to make a difference, but my Pop, he thinks that I, well, whatever I do, it's wrong. It always has been. I'm sure he just wants what's best for you. No. See, my mom died giving birth to me. Somehow, that's my fault. When I told my dad I wanted to join the army, he actually locked me in my room. What'd you do? Picked the lock. I thought I would see the world... Europe, the Philippines... Instead, I ended up here. Me too. I'm sorry. Compared to you, I have nothing to complain about. No, no, no, we all have it rough. You should go to your dance. We could dance here. Oh, oh, no, I can't, I-- I wasn't asking you. Oh. I cannot be with you The world is in our way Unless we find some other place Where day is night and night is day I would take us there How beautiful it seems Just close your eyes and suddenly We're dancing in our dreams Dancing in our dreams With you, I'd be better If nobody knew With you With you I cannot be with If I were with you No one else could see us this way If I were with you We would fight the world every day If I were with you, our moments would be few But I'd spend each one with you With you, I'd be better If nobody knew With you With you With you With you With you With you I cannot be With you You clean up all right, farm girl. Thanks, but I don't really dance. You're dancing now. Sorry. I'm more of a stay-at-home-with-a-good-book kinda gal. Nice flower. Is that a page from one of your books? No. Um, it's-- Wait a second. Is that the loyalty questionnaire? It's silly, I know. It's terrific! And much better than what I did with mine. And what was that? Let's just say I put it behind me. You are allowed to laugh. It's still a free country... sorta. I guess I haven't found much to laugh about here. Stick around. Thank you, thank you so much for coming to our first, but we hope not annual, Heart Mountain Dance. Yeah, that's true. We have one more dance before the curfew-- But first, places ladies. We've got a little surprise entertainment for you, featuring our man in Washington, Mike Masaoka. Oh! Ah! My fellow Americans, give me your tired, your poor, your homes, your businesses, your money. Just mark yes to questions 27 and 28, and I will let you stay right here in paradise. Desert, swamp, or dusty waste They say location's key Sure, you shiver in this icebox But cheer up, the rent is free! Whoo!

You are so much more than somebody's sister, or daughter, or granddaughter. So much more. Goodnight, Frankie. There once was a little girl Playing on a swing set The one her grandpa built by the sycamore tree Near the rusty farmyard gate While her mama pinned the laundry The little girl would cry out loud Push me higher, push me higher Push me, I can't wait Her mama would push a couple times But there was laundry still to do So she learned to use her own strength Pull her own weight, push on through To swing higher Higher than before Higher But scared to reach for something more Higher Higher towards the sky Until the day she bent to kiss Her mama a last goodbye There once was a little boy who loved that swing set He had a licorice twist from the store in town And two knobby skinned up knees While his sister pinned the laundry That little boy would cry out loud Push me higher, push me higher Push me, pretty please The girl would push a couple times But there was laundry still to do Then she watched amazed as suddenly He pulled his own way through To swing higher Higher than she dared Higher He flew so high, but wasn't scared Higher He could touch the sky But then she knew that he would also one day Tell her goodbye That little boy, he seemed so sure Was it something never taught to her How the years passed quickly by That girl's a woman, still afraid to try Is it too late to start again Get back that feeling I had then But now my life is upside down There's no more farm, there's no more town And no use asking why But I won't let it pass me by Life won't pass me by I'll fly Get back on that swing Higher Soaring higher up than anything Higher I want something more I dreamed I'd reach for greater things My eyes upon those golden rings I'll take what chance the future brings And soar Residents of block 13.

Calm down. You've got your all Jap unit, we've got our list. Now go fight the Germans and let us deal with domestic security. Are you sure about this, Mr. Kimura? I am. Time to go. Are the handcuffs really necessary? I've got my orders. If he changes answers, you'd let him stay, right? My answers remain no and no! How can you be so stubborn? An honorable man must take a stand for what he believes. Let's go. Papa. No touching. Hey come on, that's-- That's the protocol. No touching. What are you afraid of? That I'll slip him a knife?

Pisa, Italy. After three weeks of non-stop combat, the all Japanese American 442nd captured the high ground in the hills of Tuscany. Nowhere is their bravery more evident than in the actions of Private First Class Sam Kimura who rescued several of his fellow soldiers. Including this reporter's brother, Private Ben Masaoka. I heard from my brother. Get this. "Dear Kei. Greetings from censored. Can only write a little because censored. The 442 is censored. Love, Sammy." At least I know he's okay. What's that? My draft notice. I'm supposed to report for induction next week. How can they force you to fight? I won't go. Not unless they free our families first. But you can't resist the draft. It's not right. They'll put you in prison. This is prison! They threw us in here, made us all disappear Without charge, or cause, or reason Now we're ordered to fight Have our blood spilled despite The way that they've treated us So this is the plan Resist, take a stand They can hang us all for treason Let our families go home And we're ready to serve Be drafted like the rest We've a righteous cause There are rights and laws Let's put them to the test Resist We'll face the fire Resist If they require We enlist Then we demand they understand People name the price Resist For now or never Resist We stand together to insist Before we fight They do what's right And we pledge to sacrifice Resist We won't fight until our families are free! Kei. You need to be careful. This doesn't concern you! I promised Sam I would keep you safe. I can take care of myself. And so can Sam. I'm just trying to help. How? You can't even get us aspirin! Ben! Kimura. Mike. This is the guy who saved my life. Thank you, it's an honor. Likewise. How about a statement for the press? Tell the world why you're fighting for America. I'm a regular guy, just a Yankee G.I. Who's fighting for his country See, soldiers like me Want our families free Mine's at Heart Mountain Camp How do you feel about the draft riots at Heart Mountain? Draft riots? They're being lead by a resistor named Frank Suzuki. Frankie? You know him? Sorry to say I do. He's got them burning their draft cards and refusing to fight for their country. What do you say about that? In war we unite, we don't run from a fight In shame or humiliation American values are what lie at stake We stand for what is right Life and liberty This will set us free And we're ready to fight Resist It's now or never Resist We stand together to insist Before we fight They do what's right And we pledge to sacrifice We all must sacrifice Resist And Fight Resist And fight Resist And fight I am fighting to win back my family's freedom. For that, I'm willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. We are loyal Americans, putting our lives on the line. We condemn these draft dodgers. They dishonor our troops, and are a disgrace to all freedom loving people. We condemn agitators like Frank Suzuki, and his followers. They are cowards, and traitors. They must be punished. We must defend life and liberty by any means necessary. Okay, Kimura. We're only letting you out of the stockade on account of your son. My son? Is he... Nah, he's on the cover of Life Magazine. Isamu. Isamu. He's a hero. Doing his country proud. Can I keep? Sure. Maybe you'll learn something. What is this face they show Upon the cover This noble soldier An example to his men I am fighting for the honor of all Japanese Americans, especially my grandfather, and father, who've spent their lives proving their loyalty to the United States. I look forward to the day that I can see them free, along with my sister, Kei. I never thought I'd miss her nagging me, but she's a lot nicer than a drill sergeant. Come on. I know a place where you can hide. I'm not hiding. Don't argue! They'll be here any minute. You have to let me go. Not yet. Listen. There's gotta be a way! Listen! If they hang me for treason-- Don't say that. It could happen. No! There isn't time to say All the things I want to say They're coming for me soon I know, I know If this is all the time we get to spend this way No, I don't accept that I cannot let you go I want to capture this Remember how it feels I want to burn it in for good Why did you choose a fool Who'd die for his ideals If I had to do it all again I would Kei, if this is all we get I'm still so grateful that I met you This is not over We are not over You are my future, not my past This is not over We are not over This moment will not be our last Always the optimist That's what I learned from you You gave me hope when I had none We'll take each day I feel it in my soul Our story isn't done Imagine nothing left standing in our way You told me once that I was more than who I thought I found my place because of you Don't make me out to be Some hero that I'm not On your own, you have the will to see this through This is not over We are not over You are my future, not my past But I can hold you now And you will hold me then There is no question Not whether, only when I see such strength in you That I might believe it too I believe in you This is not over We are not over You are my future, not my past This is not over, we are not over This moment is not our last This moment is not our last There he is! Hands in the air! Don't shoot, don't shoot. On your knees, both of you. She didn't do anything. She didn't do anything. No! What am I supposed to do Pick up the pieces without you The world is upside down And they have come and torn my heart away I'm done with standing by Now it's time to do or die I will fly Any news? They're still in the stockade, but their trial's in a couple of weeks. We've got to help them now. Well, what can we do to help? They've taken our men So to see them again We must tell the world their story We'll write letters to newspapers across the whole country! People need to know they're not traitors. How will we get that past the censors? I'll think of something. The time left is short So they need our support Together we'll make a stand I need bandages. What happened? There's this guy in the stockade, Frank Suzuki. What? If he doesn't keep his mouth shut, he's gonna get himself killed. Well, bring him here. I can't do that! No, this isn't what we signed up for! This isn't what we do. Bring him here now. All clear. Hurry up! Done. So here is the plan Smuggle out what we can Or go out in a blaze of glory Does anyone have any friends who can help We can bribe a guard or two We will not relent 'Til the word is sent This is what we must do Resist Let's face the fire Resist We're climbing higher Resist Resist Resist Resist Gaman Gaman Gaman Gaman Try to breathe slowly. I can't. I saw your grandfather's garden. I can't believe he got anything to grow out here. He and the other farmers are donating the surplus to the army. He says you owe him two bucks. Any other symptoms? Morning sickness. Please. Don't tell anyone. Does Frankie know-- Frankie doesn't know. What's wrong? You need to stay calm. What's happened? He's been hurt. No. I'm trying to have him brought here. I have to go to him. No. I can't just sit here. No, let's wait. He might need an ambulance. Let's wait. How far is the hospital? Listen to me! Stop and think a moment You have to stay and rest There's a child who needs you now You have to do what's best You don't understand us Or what they put us through This is no concern of yours I'll do what I must do Years inside here taught me The world won't set things right It's up to us to save ourselves I'm ready for the fight I am stronger than before Braver than before This courage I've discovered I've never needed more I have learned to move a mountain In the middle of a war There is no returning I'm stronger than before You won't do this alone now I know where I belong You've always stood for what was right While I stood for what's wrong When I stepped into this prison Who knew what lay ahead I thought I'd face the enemy But I fell in love instead I made Sam a promise That I'd look out for you So I will help get Frankie out It's what I have to do I am stronger than before Braver than before I swear I'll stand beside you To even out the score I don't know how to thank you No thanks are needed, Kei I do what I have to I guess we're both that way After all that's happened here We cannot pretend That we aren't bound together We will see this to the end To the end We are stronger Stronger than before What ever this may cost me Doesn't matter anymore We are women who move mountains In the middle of a war We are stronger than before And I will face Within this place What lies in store We have grown stronger than Before I'll issue an order to have Frankie transferred to a hospital outside. From there, I can get him to my parents in Omaha. You'll go to prison for that. I know. Back away from the prisoner. It's all right. That's an order! Oh, Kei! I'm all right. Stand down. No, stop! Stand down! Oh, no! What's the plan, Sarge? See this? Now there are 200 men trapped behind that ridge. And two battalions have tried to reach them, but they're surrounded by the Germans. They're sending us in to rescue them. That's an uphill push through enemy territory. Loaded with landmines. It's a suicide mission! Send in the kamikaze Japs. Shut up! Hey, I call it like I see it, and I say it's a suicide mission. I said shut up! Hey! On this side of the line, we let those men die. On that side of the line, we save them. Now we go at 0500 hours. Get some sleep. Damn it. You okay, Sam? I can't feel my hand! How am I gonna shoot if I can't feel my hand? Damn it. Listen, Ben, if I don't make it-- You're gonna. You're a hero, remember? You've been reading too many of your brother's articles. Hey. What did the soldiers from Hawaii say? Go for broke. Damn right. Is that a picture of your girl? Let me see. Come on. Oh. I didn't expect her to be-- What? A nurse. Her name is Hannah Campbell. She's from Omaha. Ben, if I don't come back-- Cut that out. Listen to me. I want you to find her. I want you to tell her that I was... Hey, forget it, huh? Get some rest, Sam. With you, I'd be better But what can I do With you With you With you With you I cannot be with I can't see a damn thing. Good. If you can't see where you are, neither can they. Stay close, keep moving. If the Germans see our faces, they'll think the Emperor sent us. Hold your fire 'til my command. One muzzle flash, and it's like we turn the lights on. Not yet. They're just guessing. Hold your fire. Hold. Come on, Sam. Hold on. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Now! Go for broke, go... New letter from Sam? No. Same one. I must've read this about 20 times. Every time I look at his handwriting, it reminds me how I taught him when he was little. My hand on his, guiding it. You do bad job. Sammy still in hospital? I guess. I haven't heard anything. No telegram from Army means he is fine. Look! Hana. What did you say? You forgot Japanese? Hana, flower. Of course. Why you grow flower in vegetable garden? Just happened. Sometime flower surprise you. Kei. My dearest Kei. Greetings from the federal penitentiary. I'd say I wish you were here, but, anyway. I have great news. Because of the letters you wrote, there's talk of letting us out early. Maybe even a pardon. I may see you very, very soon. Which leads me to another pressing matter. Will you spend all your days with me A family of our own As we start our lives anew Oh are you the one who stays with me Through seasons of my life Keiko, will you be my wife Will you commit yourself to me Knowing we were meant to be We will have our day There is nothing standing in our way All that's left between us are some vows to say Just you and me and nothing in our way He asked me to marry him. Frankie? Marry? Yes! Frankie, marry. Just in time. At 8:15 am Tokyo time, the B-29 bomber, Enola Gay... A single atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima... Described as incomprehensible devastation. And we pray this promises a quick end to the war. Victory Swing with me Victory They're coming home from Germany, Manila, and France Yankee soldiers who stood up to give freedom a chance And the Fuhrer and the Emperor out of the way So it's time to hand it over to the USA Now it's liberty and freedom, woo They fought for Uncle Sam, and for me and you Four, and four, and half the beat It's the four, four, two count, victory swing The JACL applauds the government's decision to allow Japanese Americans to return to civilian life. Each evacuee will receive a bus ticket and 25 dollars. We leave with high hopes for a bright future, secure in the knowledge that we have done our part for the war efforts. Driving out of we camp, we built a special crew The decorated heroes are the 442 We thought you were the enemy, you proved us wrong Now just get back home where you belong The whole messy business, whoopsie doo! You fought for Uncle Sam, wow, good for you Now your families get to sing With the 442 count, victory swing Victory Victory Victory Victory Operator. I'm holding for the army personnel department. I'm looking for a forwarding address of a Hannah Campbell. She was a nurse stationed at Heart... Yes. I know you're not allowed to, but could you... Thanks anyway. Hail the conquering hero. How's Washington treating you? All right, I guess. Think you'd like to live here? The JACL needs a community organizer in D.C. I'm on my way to address the members now. I'd love to introduce you. I can't think of a man who deserves the job more. A war hero who led his platoon in battle. We had 800 casualties to save 200 men. Those men would've done the same for you, Sam, you know that. It was a bloodbath. Wave after wave of us. I tried to look out for Ben, but that mission-- My brother died for a just cause. A noble cause. If you want to honor his memory, then help me build a brighter world for our people. You're a true American hero. We need you, 120,000 people need you. I just want to go home. I need you. Ben's sacrifice can't have been made in vain. I won't let that happen. My family's in San Francisco. I need to see them. Of course. Friends, colleagues. My fellow Americans. There are many who believe that I betrayed my people. In some of the camps, the internees burned me an effigy, and then urinated on the debris. But I, and I alone, held the fate of 120,000 lives in my hands. I confronted government officials who wanted to deport us, to have us sterilized. Did I make mistakes? Sure, who wouldn't? But I will dedicate the rest of my life to winning the battle against racial intolerance. I will lobby the U.S. government for reparations for the millions of dollars lost in property, businesses, and income. And I will secure full citizenship for our elders. I feel certain that the crucible of history will prove that everything I did, everything, I did for the good of my people. There once was a little girl, her name was Hana That's right, that's you. Oh, it's okay, baby. Look, we're home now, see? And her mama was so excited Uncle Sammy was coming home Would you like to meet your uncle? He's a hero. Oh, oh, oh! Oh, Hanako, please don't cry! You have to be brave, just like your Uncle Sammy. You'll soar higher, higher than I dared Higher You will reach so high, and not be scared Higher You will touch the sky My little girl, the world is yours And nothing will pass you by Oh, look. There's grandpa. Say hi, little girl. We call him Ojii-chan. Remember? That's Japanese for "grandpa". Ojii-chan. Today is big day. I must clean up for Sammy. Be careful with her, Papa. Gaman Gaman Sammy! Look at you! I can't believe it's really you. Neither can I. A farm girl, in this big city. The apartment isn't much. Ugh, come here. Where's Pop? And Ojii-chan, hm? Ojii-chan passed away, in camp. Oh. I'm sorry I didn't write you about it, but I didn't want to upset you while you were recovering. No, I understand. There is so much I wanted to tell you. Did he die peacefully? Yes. In his garden. He always said we should bury him there. So I fertilize ground. Before you go in, there are a few things you need to know. Papa isn't well. Tule Lake was hard on him. They... He's much better now. Isamu. Pop! Your leg? The doctor says I'll make a full recovery. Purple Heart. Yeah. Papa, I told you, you cannot leave the baby alone. She not alone. The baby? You have a-- A baby girl. I'm an uncle. Her name is Hanako. Hana for short. In honor of Nurse Hannah. Oh, Hannah. Have you heard from her? I tried to reach her after the war, I tried to call... Hello, Sam. Welcome home. Go ahead. It's okay. No. Come on, don't be like that. Please, it's a new start for all of us. No, it's not. He had his chance, when he was drafted, and he chose to be a traitor. Don't call me that! My men died, all around me, and you spit on the graves of everyone! That's enough! Oh, it's okay. Not here, not in my house. Your house? Isamu! Frankie is honorable man. Like you, he stood up for what he believes. He is nothing like me. Nurse Hannah died for it. Papa, no. What? It was an accident. Nobody meant to-- What are you saying? She's gone. Hannah's gone. What, no, I don't understand. It's not the way-- It happened so fast, Sam. She was trying to help Frankie. Frankie, you son of a bitch! No, enough! War is over! Frankie is family now. I am proud to call him my son! Proud? Well, take a good look, Pop. Is that the son you've always wanted? Is that the man you wanted me to be? It wasn't Frankie's fault. Just pretend I died on that battlefield, Pop. Or better yet, pretend you never had a son. That's how it's felt my whole damn life! Sammy! I know what she meant to you. You can't imagine what I've been through. I understand. But-- But what? All over this country, GIs are coming home to cheering crowds. I have shrapnel in my leg, a Purple Heart on my chest, and I come home to you married, to him! Hannah is dead because of him. Hannah was just looking out for me, the way you asked her to! I was fighting for freedom while he was fighting against it. And what about you? You called for Frankie's arrest by any means necessary. What did you think would happen? Where are you going? To Washington. Mike Masaoka's offered me a job. Please don't abandon us We want you here, Sam They left us nothing Now I need you by my side How can you go and leave your family How can you turn and just walk away You've got your Frankie now He's not my blood I've no allegiance to a traitor like that man How can you still not understand You heard what Papa said The war is over It's time to start again, together like before How can you go You saw my daughter She is your blood, think of what you'll miss Don't talk of family How can you go The Kei I knew would have protected her Sam, all I ask today How can I go on living like this Just stay First a prison camp, then a war I was there too I was in love, Kei I love someone too You need us also, Sam Family's all that you've got This family I fought, there's blood on both your hands A house full of cowards and traitors like you You're the traitor, turning your back on your family If this is family, there's nothing here for me Then go on I don't need you anymore You're not the only one who's sacrificed Who did I do this for You are not a hero, you're a coward What makes a man is not what he takes It is what he leaves behind. God. What makes a man is not what he gets But what he gives back to mankind What makes a man Is what he makes of himself When he's giving it all he can That's what makes a man That's what makes a man What makes a man Giving it all he can That's what makes a man Giving it all he can Allegiance What makes a man Enough! I don't want to remember anymore! That's all there is, Sam. You left, and never came back. All those times I've reached out-- I fought two more wars. I was tired of fighting. Not even if it meant seeing Papa again, one last time? Pop never thought I'd amount to anything. He resented me from the day I was born to the day he died. Open the envelope. My issue of Life. After all these years. Papa kept that to the very end. Is this his handwriting? My Hero. Oh, Papa. You were my hero too. You sacrificed everything for us. And I never even thanked you. I'm so sorry I wasn't there to say goodbye. Kei. You still cared after all this time. I loved you so much. I missed you terribly. I should've told you when I had the chance, now it's too late. It's too damn late! A chance for forgiveness After all these years gone by I made a wish that we might have A chance to say goodbye A chance to be open For your heart once more to sing I also missed you terribly Wishing more than anything That we could just undo it all Change our ending in advance There's still a chance For hope to soar again Still a chance Make one more wish and then There's a chance For it to catch the wind and dance But we cannot know how they ever go The wishes heaven grants If I could say to you Not a chance, but two You decided to come. I'm so glad. I have something that belongs to you. Where did you get this? From my mother. Hanako? Life has given you a second chance Still a chance Still a chance To learn from what has passed Still a chance To find our way at last Still a chance For love to hold you fast From darkness into dawn Gaman Our hope is never gone Gaman Hold your head up high Gaman
