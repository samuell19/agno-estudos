TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT. My son! My son! - I'm thirsty. - The water is in the glass.Take it. Wait! When my husband comes back, I'll tell him everything. Husband? I don't think so! Yes, yes! My husband! Husband! Pusenka, you still sleeping? Why should I get up? You don't get bored like me. You always leave and I stay here with this horrible woman. Silly! You are the boss! Why do you get bored? Turn on the gramophone. I spend every free minute with you. - It's war, my dear. War. - War! War! You could take a license and get me out of here. Silly! This is no time for licenses. Soon we'll win the war. And we'll go to Dresden. Moscow, Dresden. Socks! I'm dying... Listen, Pusenka. The teacher is your sister. Isn't she? So what? Yes, she's my sister. Why are you interested? Your sister doesn't like us. Do you like her? What folly! I don't like that kind of woman. She also has fat legs. Maybe you're right. She is a little chubby. Yes. But you never told me you had a sister here. What for? We almost never see each other. - We are very different. - How different? We lived in the town, and she went to teach in a village. She's always agreeable. Everything fits well. And what's all this? So... She's a Bolshevik. Maybe she is. Who knows? Sooner or later this horrible old woman will poison us. Don't worry. Soon we'll hang her. When did your sister leave the town? Really I don't understand you. You say, you don't like my sister... but you're asking all about her. She doesn't interest me as a woman. You can be sure, not as a woman. My love. I'm dying... - What's up? - A partisan came. - Olena Kostyuk, who blew up the bridge. - And so? We've already arrested her. - Bring her to my office. - Aye. Sweetheart, I have to go. There is much work today. And I'm alone again. Don't get bored. Turn on the gramophone. They'll bring the food and I'll be right back. What are these tiny potatoes. How funny... Are you always like this? Why don't you answer me? Why are you looking at me like that? What? Am I not human? All day we can't speak two words. I'm dying... Seems like you've never made a mistake. Why don't you answer me? Am I plague-stricken? You're worse than plague-stricken. Worse! You'll die worse than plague-stricken. What do you want of me? What do you want? What should I have done? Wait to die of starvation? Wait for what? For what? They'll stay here forever. Somehow I have to... I have to manage. Has this been said by a Russian? The wife of a commander? Seryozha is probably dead, and Kurt is not a bad person. Yes! yes! yes! I know he's not bad. I don't want to live here anymore. Enough! He'll take me with him to Dresden. There is better. What kind of life awaits me here? A huge headache for a pair of socks! Yes, that's it. There you will have it. Socks! Kurt will never take you along to Dresden. He'll leave. As they do with all prostitutes. Even before they need to evacuate. You will see how they vacate. Anyway, stay calm. Sleep with your German in my bed. When our soldiers come, they'll give you a good time. Good! Good! I'll tell Kurt why you are taking so long fetching water. When he's back, I'll tell him. I'll tell, you're going to see your son. How did you know? How? Guards! I know everything I need to know. - Bring her here. - Aye. - It's her? - Yes! Name? Olena Kostyuk. Were you in the partisan brigade? I was in the partisan brigade. Why did you leave your comrades? Why did they send you? Nobody sent me. I came here on my own. Clear! You're part of the partisan brigade and suddenly you return to your home. Tell me the truth, Why did they send you? I came on my own. I couldn't stay anymore. Couldn't? Why couldn't you? Did things go wrong? Your commander has been killed? The brigade has been disbanded? Yes? I know nothing about the brigade. I came on my own. I returned home. You didn't want to fight anymore, right? No. I couldn't fight anymore. Why? - I returned home for the birth. - What? I have returned to give birth. So that's why. Take off your scarf. Take off your coat. So, you want to give birth at home. Come here. Do you know her? She is the teacher. I don't know her. - What are you doing, Olga? - What do you want? I know, your Nina is ill. - What do you care? - Kurt and I can help you. Take this chocolate for Nina. - You can tell your Fritz that I hate him. - What do you say! And even more, I hate you! Bitch! Fool! Kurt! What's up? Why are you here? I was so bored. So sad... I suffer so much without you and you're not with me. What's so interesting in talking with the old women? This old lady is a partisan. Partisan? Kurt, what do you say? She is about to give birth! You're right, go home now. I'll be right back. Kurt, my love, let me stay a little longer. Okay, but it's very boring. So you want to give birth in peace... and last week you've blown up a bridge. Yes. - Who helped you? - Nobody. I did it on my own. You lie. We know. You'd better tell us everything. Nobody. I was alone. Damn. Well. Where is your brigade? Listen. You are about to become a mother. To become a mother! Where are your brigade hiding? I don't know anything about the brigade. - They left. - Where have they gone? I don't know. Are you a Communist? No. Still I've a good mind. Guard! Come! Take her to the wood shed. Stay in the ice and think of it. When you remember, call the guard. Out! Walk! The rainbow is a good sign. A very good sign. Lenka Kostyuk, my God. Who would have imagined? Mom, that's Aunt Olena. Yes, son. Aunt Olena. She was in the same brigade with your father. Look! The German soldier teaches us to live. He doesn't imagine but that he also teaches us another thing. What does it mean for us, our homeland. If there will be just one fascist... people will not be insensitive to the Soviet government. Mom, Mom. Maybe I could take some potatoes for her. There were some in the pot last night. What are you saying? You would die. You would die needlessly. They won't see me. I'll take them for her, okay? Aunt Olena. Aunt Olena. It's me, Mishka. I'm coming, I'm coming. Aunt Olena, me Mishka Malyuchikhi. Aunt Olena, I brought bread for you. Mom. Mom, Mom. Mom. Mom... Mom. Mom, Mishka has fallen. - I'm going to Aunt Olena. - Shut up. You're not going anywhere. They killed Mishka. Sasha! Goddamn Fritz! What is this? Don't touch. It's a German bullet killed him. We shouldn't have let Mishka go. I don't know, sweetheart. I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't. Yes... Sweetheart. Yes... You're right. Where can we bury him? - We have to look tomorrow morning. - Let's bury him in the garden. Impossible. They would hear and kill us. The earth is hard as rock. Perhaps we could just cover him with snow. We must bury him at home. He'll stay with us. He'll rest at home. I can't think of anything else. Sasha, take the shovel. We'll dig here. Come on. Nobody can find him here. You must find it. Who has taken the body? - Whose son? - I don't know. - What do you know, Gaplik? - I did everything I could. I don't agree with you. I don't agree at all! They did too much, you gave me little information. - I told you Olena Kostyuk. - And what? - I told you the teacher. - Teacher! She's not a big deal. People have gone mad, Captain. They don't speak! Before, they had a row with each other... they were angry, always unhappy. But now, their mouths shut. Not a word. Now, they are just looking. What "looking"? Looking but remaining silent. Don't tease me, Gaplik. Looking! looking!.. Silence! We'll force them to talk. We'll hang all the people. Young and old. I've prepared a new list of hostages, Captain. Out! And Gaplik, you didn't tell us who has brought the bread. The bread has been hidden. It has been buried, Captain. I can't do anything on my own. I need your help. Have I refused help? I'll give you a soldier. Register and search all houses. Is that clear? I'll try, Captain. Don't forget Gaplik. You have to find the boy's body. Aye. So that the soil doesn't enter into his eyes. Take a little and spread it on your brother. Sasha. Well. We have to firm the soil. So they shouldn't find him. - Is everyone here? - Yes. Don't you know the orders? Bring out the numbers. Now, he will read. "Up until now, citizens haven't yet paid the tax in kind agreed with them, that is, their bread. Be aware that the deadline to pay the tax of bread, is up to three days from publication of the order. Who doesn't do his duty within three days, to the motherland and to the German Army - will be punished..." - May I ask a question? - Who are you? - 412. - Who? - 412. - Name? - 412. What do you want? Allow me to ask a question. Which country we have to do our duty to? Naturally you have to according to where you live. To the German homeland. To the German army. Now everything is clear. Who doesn't do his duty within three days, to the homeland... and the German army, will be sentenced in accordance with the statutes in violation of the laws of acts of sabotage and acts of resistance to the death penalty. The Commander, Captain Werner." Have you heard it all? - Yes. - Have you understood all? - We've understood. - As we had to understand. Where are you going? There is still something else. "Last night, someone has tried to give bread... to a partisan who is in detention. The bread was given by a boy of about ten years. The violator was killed." Stand still or they will notice. "The body of the boy who was below criminal age was removed and hidden by an unknown attacker. Who knows anything about this crime, or the identity of the criminal, or those responsible for the concealment of the body have to notify the duty officer of the German Army." What are you looking at? "In order to ensure the order and capturing the attacker the German army has arranged to retain as guarantors the following citizens. Olga Polanchuk, Aleksey Sechenko, Maria Tchechor, Ostav Vashenko, Osip Grotchak." Don't do that, I'm not the only one. "If the culprits aren't found in three days, if all the bread as the natural tax, is not given in three days, the guarantors will be hanged." Can we go now? The meeting is over. You can go out. Except those whose names have been read. Take away the detainees! Clear the square! Don't worry about the children. We, all the people will care for them. I'll take mine. Do you hear me, Maria? What's that? - A number. - Number? What? The numbers should taken only by the people? Not the animals? The numbers are only for the people. Only for the people. Take off the number, Vasko. It's only for the people, you understand? That's it. Tell me cuckoo! Will our soldiers arrive soon? Soon! Will my daddy be back too? He'll be back! - So how are the cows? - All right. Fritz! Get out of here! Milk. We don't have any milk. Our cow was taken by Fritzs. Partisan! Ivan! Listen... we're waiting. What are you thinking, Ivan Petrovich? Comrade Lieutenant... My heart feels that I'll have a son. My wife, what a woman! - Let me see. - Come on, come on. - Pretty. - Beautiful. Nice. How beautiful. Pretty. Yes, she's pretty. I'd like to know... boy or girl? - A boy. - So you've given birth to a healthy child. I guess now you'll be more cautious. It's no longer just about you. Now you can save or lose your son. Last night, someone tried to give bread to the detainee. Who was it? - I don't know. - How don't you know? - I don't know. - Which of your neighbors have children? Children? All of them have children. Who doesn't want to have children! Who do you think could send bread? Who could send a boy of ten or eleven? I don't know. There are many boys in the village. There are in every house. It's okay. Tell me the location of Comrade "K"? Kudriavin. It's your commander's name. Where is he? - I don't know. - You don't know? Where was he when you came to the village? - In the forest. - Which forest? - I don't know. - You just repeat "I don't know!" Begin! "I don't know", "I don't know"... Enough! Listen... you're a mother. You have a son. Don't you want to live long and bring up your son? Of course, I want to. You can save him... save your life and his life. I give you a chance. Don't be stupid, take it. Listen, the Red Army is defeated. Everything is over. Why remain silent? "I don't know", I don't know". You know! I can forgive your sins. You can live in peace in the village and can bring up your child. I give a chance to you and your child. If not yourself, think of your child's future. You've given him life, you have no right to take it. - How take it? - You understand! Understand all! If you don't answer, your son dies. Think about it. I'm waiting. - I don't know anything. - Is that so! I've treated you humanely. Wait! I'll show you! Sergeant! Guards! Guards! Take away the child! I won't treat you humanely anymore. Well, will you speak? Leave her! Do you hear what I'm saying? Will you answer? This is the last time I'll ask you. I won't say anything. Out! Show me who you are. A Bolshevik or a mother? I am a mother! So, you'll tell me where they are. I won't say anything. Do you have only this child? No. How? Do you have more children? Girls or boys? Boys! A boy... In the forest, he's Kudriavin. And beyond the forest, my sons! Will you speak? I'm asking you one last time. Where are the partisans? The chicken is cooked, The chicken is roasted. Also the chicken wanted to live. One is captured, One has been arrested. One has been asked to show its documents... Stand up! You are in the court. Ready, Comrade Kudriavin. Kudriavin! You... Kudriavin... Why do you whine? Want to show yourself as a little boy? Okay, calm down. - Don't act stupid! - You, start to write. Starosta. Stand! What did you do? Why do you stay silent? Why don't you tell us... how they have tortured Olena Kostyuk. What did you do in the school? Don't you speak Russian? Speak! If you don't answer, I'll cut off your ear. Evdoki Petrovich! It's enough! "Evdoki Petrovich!, Evdoki Petrovich!" Well, Comrades, everything is clear, right? - Yes. - Clear! - Clear! - Clear! Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Please have mercy on me. I beg you. I'll never do anymore. My dear judges, They have forced me! I've been compelled by force! Compelled by force! My dear, merciful judges. I beg you. Please have mercy! Please! I beg you! I beg for your children! - Because of you, dog! Our children died. - Stand up! Go there. They have forced me! Forced me! Is that so! They have forced our unfortunate man! God, God. Don't you dare make the sign of the cross. Have mercy... Evdoki Petrovich, have mercy. Be merciful. For the love of God... Don't bother God. He's not your God. He's our God. Ours! He's not sold for Germans. Don't bother God! Don't pray! "The revolutionary tribunal, on behalf of the Soviet government..., sentences the accused Piotr Gaplik... Kulak, Executioner and Starosta under German rule..., for treason against the homeland and betrayal... to the death penalty. Execution will be carried out immediately." Do it! Have mercy! My dear judges! Have mercy! Have mercy! Attention! - They've found the Starosta? - Not yet. - Disappeared? - As you said, commander. - Did you ask everyone? - Yes, also some arrested. - What did they say? - They didn't say anything. Find the Starosta! We've looked everywhere but we haven't found him yet. He can't fly, He surely walked. What was the patrol doing, sleeping? Kolya, they're bringing our soldiers. Come on, let's see. Hurry! My God. Barefoot. They haven't boots. Look at them, they're all bloody. - Take it, son. - We haven't eaten bread for three days. - Come on, quickly. - Here, take it, I'll bring more. My God. Take that. Take that, dear. Pavel! My Pavel! Go ahead, quickly. Fire! We don't need anything, comrades. Stay away. Don't risk your life. You're women, you're our mothers. They're shooting. Sasha, Sasha! You can't do anything here. Gather the kids. You have to run to the road, through the first turn. Leave the bread and potatoes on the road. Maybe our soldiers take at least one piece. Boys, follow me. We have to reach the road first. Run through the orchards, it's a shortcut. Quick! Quick! Come on boys. Hurry up! We're late. Why do you beat me? - Horrible. - They killed many people again. You mustn't be afraid. If you're afraid once, they'll make you do whatever they want. Vasya wasn't afraid but they killed him, as Pashyuk. Did I say they wouldn't shoot you? They are Fascists, they're born to kill. - I mentioned the Power! - So, what's the Power? The power is strength in yourself... to never give up. Being silent when you must be silent, they shouldn't get a single word. But above all, knowing that when this will end none of them will remain alive here. Kurt. You aren't talking with me anymore. You act as if you weren't here. I had a hard day. I'm tired. The pregnant woman hasn't said anything. The hostages didn't speak. All of them keep silent. They're just looking. Prisoners! All people bring bread to the prisoners! Listen, Pusenka. Why don't you chat with your sister? - My sister? - Yes. You have to help me. You have to talk to the teacher. She knows many important things. Impossible, she never talks to me. Explain that it will be best for her if she starts to work with us. - She doesn't want to talk to me. - Why? Don't you see that nobody wants to talk to me? They treat me like a leper. Don't start again! Explain that I know everything. If she doesn't say where the partisans are and who killed the Starosta, I'll arrest her. And I'll hang her. What? Do you think I won't hang her because she's your sister. I'll hang her! I don't care at all. Hang her. No problem. Of course I can speak with her, but she won't say anything. You should talk. You should talk. You should talk. Come in. Pasha. - Olga, how are you? - Why are you here? Listen, Olga. You are in danger. Olga... I want to help you. Refusing my help, will be foolish. At least think of Nina. Olga, sweetheart, you and I are sisters. Don't forget. You're my only relative. I want to help you. Look... what I brought you. Danish canned food, Dutch cheese. French biscuits, sugar, condensed milk. And this chocolate for Nina. I'm dying... This is a German drug to cure all ailments. What's wrong with you? How we could have the same mother? Yes, Olga. She's our mother, you shouldn't refuse my help. They'll be here for a long time. Forever! You have to manage somehow. Look how you're living now. Our mother... Don't you dare talk about my mother. You haven't had a Russian mother. You're very angry, Olga! You don't understand. They could arrest you. If not today, by tomorrow surely. You could lose your life, without knowing anything about it. I can save you. What should I do? Olga, sweetheart. Relax a little bit. Apart from us nobody will know anything. Where are the partisans? Who killed the Starosta? Olenka, Olga. I'm dying... Get out! Germans' bitch! Quick! You'll see... You'll regret this. Mother. You... you... My God! - You! - Mother. - You! - Mother... Mother. - You... you. - It's okay, Mother! Mother! It's nothing, my children. Come on, mother. Calm down. Calm down. Germans everywhere. - Also at home. - Do you live here? - Yes, of course I live here. - What is this? My name in German. - Would you eat something? - No, mother. We're not here to eat. We need to know where they are and how they are equipped. I'll tell, but are our soldiers coming or not? Yes, they'll come. But we need to know what the Germans have and where. This is a large village. Almost three hundred houses. There is a German cannon in the square. Thank you mother, you're brave. Good luck, my children. Come back soon. I'll check the road. Fedosya. You're always late. Make the bed. Where are you going again? Where I have to go. As soon as he arrives I'll tell. Okay, no problem, tell your husband. I'll tell myself what has happened. Maybe you wouldn't tell. - What? - Nothing. If you want to tell, do it. Everyone already knows you're a spy for the Germans. - Hurry up and tell him. - Of course I will. I'll tell, you're going to see your son. Kurt will arrest you. It is prohibited to hide people. Look how scared I am. Don't you see how I tremble? You'll tremble. You'll fear. - You'll be crying with fear. - What are you saying? - Why should I be afraid? - From the people. They won't forgive you. The Patriots have preferred the gallows. Olena preferred to run naked in the snow. Your bloody tears wouldn't help them. Go out right now. At once! It makes me sick just looking at you. Get out of here! Remember that this is my home. The worst people I've ever seen. Worse than the eighteenths. Of course, worse. But they can't kill all of us. Always someone back to plant and rebuild. Better... richer... more cautious than before the war. I'd like to see that, how we will live after the war. No, I'd not want only that. Also I'd want to see how he'll die the last Fascist in our village. Where is she? Pasha! Seryozha! Kurt! I'd thought your last word would be "Mom". That was my wife. Bring them here. Fascist bastards! - Damn! - Goddamn! Enough! Stop it! Stop! Stop! - Comrade commander, let us! - You can't do that. They are prisoners! Stop! Enough! Calm down! What? You want to protect Fascists? Killers! They killed my son. Stop! Stop! Stop! My Sisters! That's enough! Stop! Do you want to kill them? One or two minutes and all will end. For Levonyuk! For Olena! For my Vasya! For all our children! For all the victims! All will be done in two minutes? No! Let them wait their destiny! Let them drink to the last drop! Sisters! If one of them dies now, it will be a prize for him. No! No! No! Let them wait to be repudiated by their women and their own children. Let them hear that "No! They aren't our fathers!" Let them answer to the people's court... for the torture they did our loved ones. Let God's wrath fall on them... and the earth reject these damned! The rainbow is a very good sign. Oh my soul! How you wish a beautiful life, Come on, fight for it! / From an old Ukrainian song / The End
