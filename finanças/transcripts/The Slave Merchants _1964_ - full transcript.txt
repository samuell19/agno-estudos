SORAYA SLAVE OF THE ORIENT with KIRK MORRIS and MICHELE GIRARDON They're coming. Right. Open the gate! Please excuse me. Guards, your officer wants you right away! Change clothes with them! Father! Ganor, you killed my father to whom you owed everything! You'll pay for this betrayal! Daikor! You'll never seize this city, Ganor. The people will rebel against you. Take him away! No! Daikor! Don't worry about your brother. I'm sure you can convince me to spare him. Now's your chance. You must reach our mountain tribes. Tell them to get ready, we need to prepare for an attack. Look out, they're coming! Put him in chains. No! Leave me alone! The town is ours, Rabek. Thanks to your strategy Ganor now rules the city. You owe me an answer. I truly hope you haven't forgotten. Because I'm not in the habit of repeating myself. I loathe you. A traitor! You seem to forget the kingdom is mine, Soraya. You will now obey me. Without me, you have no legal right to the kingdom. No, Ganor, you're helpless and you know it. And you'll wait forever before I give in to you! You're wrong, Soraya. You'll be my queen. With or without consent! You miserable wench! You'll see...I'll take you and that royal temper of yours! No! Leave me alone! I'll never be yours! Never! - Stop! - No! - Stop! What happened? She killed herself. She threw herself into the river. - I'll have her rescued. - No, no. I hope the crocodiles tear her to pieces. She never would have obeyed me. But it doesn't matter now. Hey! Aimu, you've been in the water long enough. Come out now. Wonderful! Tell me, Aimu, do you think this little fish will satisfy both our appetites? I'm afraid we'll have to do some more hunting! It's a woman! Look, it's the seal of king Sandor. Who are you? Where... Don't worry, you're among friends here. I'm Antares of Bitina. But who are you? Why are you afraid to talk? I can be of some help to you, but at least tell me what happened. What difference does it make, when you're only a slave? Well, it can make a great difference, if the woman enslaved is a royal princess. Hurry now, Aimu, go to the camp and bring our horses here. And come right back! Who's that boy? Is he a mute? Yes. My village was destroyed by bandits. My sister tried to flee and was killed. The others...were massacred. I wasn't at home. When I came back, only the boy was still alive. They spared him after they cut out his tongue. The only witness to this tragedy can't speak. I will avenge this massacre. I'm looking for the man who ordered it. I won't rest until I find him. It's my sole purpose in life. I'll find him and make him pay. -Do you know him? No, not yet. The only trace I have is a rare, special sign. The boy keeps drawing it. I don't understand it, but I'll find out. Please tell, what brought you here? You needn't fear. Yes. Well, what have we here? Where are you coming from? Answer me. Can't you hear? Answer me! Idiot! This way we'll know nothing. Forward! There was nothing I could do. Ganor controls the city... and there's no one to reclaim the throne that is rightfully mine. Why don't you try to get some rest now? Later we can decide what to do. No! No, no! Let me go! Antares! Be careful! Can't you see you're brusing her? Get your paws off of her! You're ruining a costly treasure. Have no fear, they won't hurt you. - You're worth too much to us. - Let me go! No! Antares! Antares! Antares! Either you talk or I'll rip your eyes out! Who was that man? I'll talk! He's Murad...and he works for Akrim, a slave trader... and the.... Aimu! Aimu, where are you? Wake up, boy. Another caravan is arriving! Welcome to our market, your Highness. - Where is my tent? - This way, your Highness. Put everything in it's right place. There, now. Akrim! Akrim! You can't imagine how many noble customers have arrived! Akrim! Akrim! Don't you want to greet them? Have you no respect for the kings of the Orient? Akrim! Come for just a moment! The camp is full, I tell you! Abdul, here comes the Emir Kamal. Welcome, Highness. This way, please. You'll have a great auction tomorrow, Abdul. There's no doubt now that tomorrow we'll have the greatest slave auction in all of history! Let go of me! Leave me alone! Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Look what I have found for your market, Akrim. Ah, this must surely be the hand of providence, Murad! The flower to complete my collection! Murad, bring Adanna here. You haven't any right to keep me here. No right? Are you sure? I'm a queen. You are a slave. But you will remain here only for tonight. Tomorrow you will bring a price that only a king can afford to pay. Adanna, you will take care of this young creature. Have her rest up and then prepare her with our costliest jewels... and most audacious veils. Murad, where did you find her? Near the river, with a strongman who took 5 of my best men from me. You'll have to sell her for a high price to cover my expenses. Abdul, you're the most skillful slave auctioneer in the entire Orient. So I needn't tell you the girl will be sold last, and for an astronomical price. Yes, you can rely on that. I'll see to it that you're well paid. And now let us drink to our good fortune. Tomorrow's market will bring a rich reward, won't it, Abdul? That's the slave market. Come, lad. Come. In all honesty, I say in all honesty... have you ever seen a more beautiful, more stupendous, more angelic creature? Lips like ruby wine, and then her eyes... green like emeralds, O noble sirs. Nowhere in the Orient will you find a more noble and regal comportment. What attraction, what charm... What sweetness to discover! And this precious flower of the Orient can be all yours for the incredible sum of 50 miserable piasters! 55! 60 piasters! 65 piasters! 100 piasters! 110 piasters! Oh, by Allah! Are you going to sit there and let this Bedouin take this stupendous jewel away from you? Come now, Ibrahim! This is no time to show your miserliness. Just look at this delightful desert flower! How can you refuse her? Courage, Ibrahim, or she'll slip through your fingers! Be generous for once and make your offer. - We stand at 110 piasters. -120! - 130! - 140! 150! - Too high for me. We're at 150. No other offer? Well then, the miser gets... 300 piasters! 300 piasters? Pay 300 piasters if you want her, I think she's ugly! She's yours! And now, a voluptuous Syrian beauty for only 50 piasters... Feast your eyes, and admire her admirably provocative form... Only 50 piasters I say, to the first that raises his hand. - 60 piasters! - 80 piasters! We're at 80 piasters! - 100 piasters! - 100 piasters! Who will offer more for this Syrian delight? - Speak up, noble sirs! - 150 piasters! - 150! - 200! - 200 piasters! - No other bids? Then she's yours for only 200 piasters. And now a special treat, noble sirs! Here we have two daughters of the Nile. Come, come. For those who haven't experienced the charms of an African woman... these two women were made to alleviate your lonely hours. Only 500 piasters for both, a real bargain. Yes, noble lords, only 500 piasters for these flawless Nubian beauties! 500 piasters! The first to raise his hand will take them away! - 500! - 600! - 650! 700! - 750! - 800! - 900! 1000 piasters! Who offers more? 1, 050! 1, 100! 2000 piasters! Oh, for heaven's sake, allow me to settle your differences. We stand at 2000 piasters. Now when I give the signal, the first to raise his hand will take them away. Ready now, go! I was first! One moment. You're still willing to pay 2000 piasters? Yes. Then give me a thousand. And one from you. Abdul, a maid to each one of these noble buyers. Certainly. She's yours. Carry on, Abdul. Yes. And now, noble sirs, I offer you a treasure that has never, ever... You'll be sold now, and I can assure you that you won't help yourself if you rebel. - I offer you not just a beauty, but a queen... I must run away! But that's impossible. You'll have an opportunity only if you allow yourself to be sold. Then maybe you'll be able to run away, but not now. We have been blessed by her presence. For I assure you, her divine beauty... - Seems as if Kamal is bored with our auction. - Oh, Don't worry, he's interested all right. - Worthy of a king, with the purse of an emperor... What price shall I ask? What price can I possible ask for her, when she is worth more than all the treasure of the Orient? Ah, I'm truly at a loss, my noble sirs... because the charm, the regal poise of this maiden has no price. Begin, my lords, and make your offer. Look at him now, he's drooling. Behold her beauty! I'm sure there are among you at least one who is prepared to offer the true worth of this sublime creature. I will not even give you a starting price, because, allow me to repeat, compared to the beauties you've known before, this regal maiden surpasses all! - I offer 100 piasters. - 150 piasters. - 200 piasters. - 250 piasters. - 300! - 400! - 450! 500 piasters! I ask you, can you really expect me to relinquish her for only 500 piasters...? - 550! - 600! - I offer 750 piasters! - 800! - 1000! - 2000! - 3000! - 4000! - 5000! 10,000! - 15,000! - Raise the price. - Aren't you asking too much, Akrim? He may drop out. I've been in the slave market too long. You can be sure he won't drop out. 29,000! That's all I have. Then she's mine, at 30,000 piasters. - Go 20,000 above. - But that's too risky! I ask you, surely there is one more offer? I bid 50,000 piasters! With that sum of money I could build a whole city. She's not worth it. But I'll have her all the same. I'm warning you Akrim, I'll not be led on again. You had your man call out a total of 50,000 piasters! Now I offer 50,000 and 1 piasters! And not a single piaster more. Alas, you leave me no choice. The maid is yours. Take her to the caravan, we'll leave immediately. Come. We have prepared the camp, Kamal, and placed the girl in her tent. Bring her to me. Let me in. Come with me, Kamal is waiting for you. And take some good advice: don't keep him waiting! Bring her here. - Come. - Don't touch me. - I'll not be handled like a slave. - No? And why not? Because I'm Soraya, the daughter of king Sandor. I don't care who you are. I want you as a slave and I'll have you! No, no! No! Hurry, Aimu! Go! - Antares! - Run, hurry! After them! Bring them back! Come on! Hurry up, lad. Inspect his wagon. He's carrying arms! Let down the gate! Bring it up! Open the gate, ride after them! A perfect place to hide! Ride on! Who are you? What happened? Speak up! Who are you? Soraya! Hussein! Don't worry, we'll take care of you. No, there's no time for me. In the mountains of Barin, you'll find Salim and the rest of those loyal to the king... Tell him I couldn't get his message through to Daikor. Daikor is still alive? Yes. Ganor is holding him as a hostage in the palace so the people won't revolt against him. I've been carrying on, for those people who are still faithful to you, my princess... We'll take his message through to Daikor. I wasn't expecting to see you so soon again, Kamal. - What brings you here? - I've been deceived, Akrim. - I demand you return my 50,000 piasters. - And for what reason, may I ask? I was sold a slave that our ancient laws would never consider as such! That's not possible. Are you sure? The girl you sold me is Soraya, the daughter of king Sandor. The daughter of king Sandor? How could you tell? You'll take my word for it. And you'll also return every last piaster you took from me! But of course. Where is she? She escaped. She was carried away by a man who attacked and burned our encampment. One man? Alone? It was Antares. What are you talking about, Kamal? Antares was eliminated and his family destroyed. No, he set fire to my camp and freed princess Soraya, I saw it with my own eyes. Also, Soraya called him by that name. And you expect me to swallow such a ridiculous story and give you my good money? You doubt my word? And why not? No one has ever dared to insult my name, much less the likes of a dirty, filthy, conniving seller of slaves! And now you'll order that my money be brought here immediately... you miserable stinking blackguard, or I'll squeeze the very life out of you! Not even a piaster, nothing! It's my money and you have no claim to it! Damn you, filthy slaver...! Murad, disarm his men. Aloumba, get ready to break camp. We leave immediately. What'll we do? I don't know, but I've got to stop Ganor. Somehow I've got to get to the city. How will you do it? You heard what Hussein said. The mountain tribes are still faithful to you. But if they attack the city, then my brother... I know, I already thought of that. Our first move will be to free him. Yes, but how? Most of the citizens are against Ganor. It's a matter of entering the city and organizing a revolt. That's insane, Antares, you'd be killed! Does it really make any difference what happens to me? Yes, Antares. Antares, should the fact that I'm a princess keep me from falling in love? Hey Aimu, come here! You have an important mission to carry out. Take Soraya to the rebels in the mountains while I ride to the city. Take good care of her. I'll return as soon as possible, but now I must head for the city. Be careful. Take care, my boy. Be at the river bend at dawn. I'll either meet you there or send someone who recognizes you. - Take care. -Goodbye! There's a riderless horse coming! That's a nice horse! Let's take him. Open the gate! That might be the horse of a arms smuggler. What have you done? What's happened? Hey! There's a fire! Douse that fire! Ibrahim, what is it? Get over here! The fire's spreading! That's not true. Fire doesn't start by itself, I tell you! Ganor is much too lax with the people... - What's going on here? Quick, you fools! Put that fire out! Whoever it was has fled. Well, which one of you was it who tried to escape? You think you can fool me? Is this your way of showing gratitude for Ganor's favors, hm? The trouble is you're treated as queens, not slaves. Come, come, Ganor awaits you. Let's go. Well, you're no exception, hm? Move along now. Aren't you eager to know which of you finds his favor? Akrim wants to speak with you. Akrim, here? He must be out of his mind. - Where is he? - I had him wait for you where no one would see him. And no one will. I thought I told you never to set foot in this palace. Please forgive me, but I was forced to come here. Something happened, something unexpected. - You can... - What happened? I sold a slave to emir Kamal for 50,000 piasters. 50,000 piasters? Wonderful, did you bring it? Or are you going to tell me you don't have the money? No, it's here! I've always kept my part of the bargain. You capture the slaves and I sell them. That was our agreement, wasn't it? And you've always been satisfied, no? Well, then? The slave I sold Kamal....was Soraya. Soraya? Have you gone mad? It's not my fault, I've never seen her. You know that! And where is Soraya now? Kamal's caravan was destroyed by Antares! You expect us to believe that? Antares is dead! Antares is alive! And together with Soraya they escaped! Of all the stupid imbeciles! You'll pay dearly for this error, Akrim! Do you have any idea where they are now? Their traces lead into the city. That's impossible. Antares would never come here. He can't possibly know we're the ones who destroyed his city. Does anyone else know that Antares has returned? No one, Ganor. There was Kamal, but he's been eliminated. Bravo, Akrim. At least for once you acted wisely. Now you realize why I wanted to speak to you in person. If the populace had their princess with them, if they didn't know that Soraya was dead, you'd have trouble squelching a rebellion. I'm sure you appreciate that. I imagine you expect just compensation, Akrim. Oh, I never even thought of it! You know me better than that. But I'm aware of your generosity. And who else knows that Soraya is not dead? Oh, no one. You know I never reveal your secrets. Of course. Such loyalty deserves to be repaid. Come. Please come in, Akrim, thank you. I'm always your loyal subject and servant. Ganor! Ganor! Ganor! Ganor! No, Ganor! You know I'd never betray you! Have pity, Ganor! Have pity on me! You wanted to blackmail me. No! This will put an end to that, my friend. And now your secrets are also dead, Akrim. What's going on? Antares! Out of the way! Be off! Master... - Antares has come back. - And he's sure to seek revenge. We must capture him at all costs. If the people find out he's here, I'm afraid there'll be no stopping him in forming a revolt. And yet they'll have to accept my rule, if I force Daikor to proclaim me as king. Come. Daikor! Daikor! It's me, Antares. We've got to get out of here! You were sent here by Ganor. Look here. Soraya! Soraya's alive? She sent you after me? Yes. I'll explain later. There's no time now. Someone's coming. Daikor, I'm sure you'll be interested in knowing what my plans are. I will soon attack the rebels in the mountains and destroy them. I will spare their women, Daikor. They'll be sold in the markets as slaves. You're a traitor, and one day you'll get the punishment you deserve. You needn't worry about me, Daikor. You'd best think of you own fate... now that you're about to reach the end of your days... unless...unless you're still interested in saving your own people... and yourself. On what conditions? You know my terms. You must abdicate the throne in my favor. and instruct your subjects to refrain from stirring up any revolt... and to show me, the one and only king, complete and absolute obedience. You'll have your answer...tomorrow. I need more time to consider it. Naturally, you have every right. Consider it well, Daikor, and make your decision a wise one. You have until dawn tomorrow. Listen, we've got to hurry. Soraya's safe now, she's together with the mountain tribes. But now we've got to find a way out of the palace, Daikor. There's only one way to escape from here, through the pool in the harem. It's connected with the river that leads out of the city. Let's go before the guards come back! - Are you alright? - Yes. Then change clothes with the guard I put in... He's gone! Come! Hurry before he gives the alarm! Through there! The passage is closed! Look out! Daikor has escaped! Not here! Let's go up! Antares is with him! After them! There's a mute boy, he's waiting for you near the bend of the river. He'll lead you to the mountains. Go, jump now. We'll have to swim underwater. Remember the passage is in the center of the pool. Antares! Up there! Surround him, he's all alone! - Not yet, Rabek! - And why not? - I want you to take good care of him. - And why should we spare him? - Do as I say! We'll execute him in front of the people... and end the legend of Antares for all time. Have all the provinces notified...immediately. Why deny the populace his heroic death? Are you the mute boy that Antares sent here? Then you must immediately take me to Soraya. Assemble all the women before the city gates! Hurry up, load them onto the wagons. Let's go! Move it! Put the women on the wagons. No one dare try to steal one. What do you want with me? Ganor has ordered that you receive a worthy death sentence, Antares of Bitina. It's more than a rebel like you deserves. Now get up! How do you know my name? Let's say your arrival was pre-announced. Let's go now. Here comes the mute boy with someone. It's Daikor, our new king! - How did you escape? - With the help of Antares. Daikor! Where's Antares? I don't know...he stayed behind to cover my escape. Ganor's men captured our women! They'll be sold as slaves! Salim! Call all the men to arms! We ride to the city! I already have. We're prepared to attack! You're worried about Antares? Ganor is ruthless. You know what will happen if you attack the city. It's our only hope if we want to free our people. Antares means everything to me, Daikor. I love him. You'll see. he'll be alright. You're our king, Daikor, and we await your orders. Very well. Then you'll remain here until we've taken the city. Let's go! The rebels are attacking the city! Have him killed! Call the archers! Look, Antares! It's Ganor's assassins! Have him stopped! Stop him! The people are getting out of hand! Hey! All riders this way! Forward, everyone! You've got to stop him, Rabek, before we lose the people! Forward! Attack! The rebels are coming! Watch out for the archers! Halt! Halt! Hey boy, what are you doing? Go back! Go back to Soraya! If they can't open the doors, we'll have to find another way in! It's the boy! Everyone inside! Inside! Quick! There he is! Look out, Antares! Thank Allah you're still alive, Antares! Come, we've got to get Ganor before he escapes! - To the palace! - Forward! Ganor, your reign of terror is ended! The blood of those you sold into slavery will fall upon you! Where's Antares? Soraya! He's with Ganor. The man who took the slaves... and destroyed his kin. Come with me. No, don't go in! You'll get lost! Only he knows the secret of the magic glass! I'm waiting! Do you have the courage, Antares? Come, come Antares! Come in, Antares! Come into the chamber of death! Now, Antares... would you like to know which of these Ganors will be the one to kill you? Where's Antares' courage now, huh? You may have the secret of the glass' reflection, but you can't prevent its being broken, Ganor! Let me see you now! - No, no. No. Have pity on me. Have pity. I'm begging you! You'll pay for all your bloodshed! No! Come out into the open! No...no... No...Antares, please! You can have my gold, all my riches are yours! All your gold is covered with blood! No, Ganor, you must die! - You'll pay for everything, Ganor! - No! You'll pay for all those you sold into slavery! Ganor, you deserve to die for killing my family! No! The spell of your magic glass is ended, Ganor! No... You'll answer for all your bloodshed! I'll choke you with my own hands and liberate the people from you! No...No! Have mercy! Antares! Come, lad. THE END
