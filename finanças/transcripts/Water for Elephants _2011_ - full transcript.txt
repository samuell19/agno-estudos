(TRUCK HORN HONKING) DRIVER: What's the word, Charlie? We going through, or what? Heading back through the truck? Come on, old timer, what are you doing? Uh, excuse me, sir. Can we help you? Can we help you with something? Did I miss the Spec? Yeah, I'm afraid so. The show was this afternoon. Oh. Did you come with the folks from Green Haven? Why don't we get out of the rain, and we'll call them for you. No, no, no, no! I came on my own. No, it's okay. We're gonna call the home. We're gonna have them come pick you up. I'm telling you, I didn't come with the home! Why don't you take those rings out of your head, and maybe you won't be deaf and dumb! (BOTH CHUCKLE) Well, it's alive. I'm sorry, kid. I didn't mean that. Your rings look very pretty. Russ, why don't you take that walker back to my trailer and finish packing up? Sir? Man, I gotta get you out of this parking lot. Why don't you sit down in the wheelchair? We'll go inside and make some calls. Come on, please. Malcolm, tell them to come through! Yeah. Hey, how you doing? I'm looking for a number I can't seem to find in the book. It's for a nursing home called Green Haven. I hope they sweat. I walked right out of the door and nobody noticed. Green Haven. It's a nursing home. Hello? Hello? Hagenbeck- Wallace! Before the wreck. Yeah. You know circuses? I should. I been on two. Hey, is there a relative maybe I can call? Or another number you have? The first was the Benzini Brothers. Benzini Brothers? When? 1931. '31 for how long? (CHUCKLES) Now, you know the Benzini Brothers never saw the end of '31. Are you telling me that you were there for... - Right in the middle of it. - Well, that's incredible, because after the Hartford fire and the Hagenbeck- Wallace wreck, that's pretty much the most famous circus disaster in history. (SNIFFLING) Are you okay? You got anything to drink around here that isn't apple juice? Uh... Yeah, I think so. - There you go. - Thank you. (EXHALING) I remember you. So, how long you been in that home? Too long. I don't know why they call it a home. You don't know anybody there. They stuff you so full of drugs, you don't care. Five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died. They take turns visiting on weekends. My son forgot whose turn it was today, so... I can't blame him. The kid's 71. He's starting to lose it up here. They're not bad kids. It's not their fault I'm old. I had a good life, you know. A big life. Take a seat. Yeah. I'm sorry. You know what? My name is Charlie O'Brien III. Jacob Jankowski, the only. (LAUGHS) That's good. Don't you have to call the home? I think we should let them sweat. But if I could, I was wondering, you know, could you talk to me about what happened in 1931? Gonna need another bottle of this. It was a big day, that last day of my final exam. I couldn't move fast enough. YOUNG JACOB: My life was finally gonna start, and I knew exactly where it was taking me. (MOTHER SPEAKING POLISH) Inside our house, there was no sign of a Depression. My mother and father had left Poland in much worse condition. (SPEAKING POLISH) To them, nobody could be poor in America if they had half a brain in their head. (MOTHER SPEAKING POLISH) Love you, too, Mommy. (SPEAKING POLISH) After six years of dissections, castrations, and shoving my arm up a cow's ass more times than I care to remember, by the end of that day, I knew I'd be a Cornell graduate of Veterinary Science. And by the end of that night, I'd be the first man Catherine Hale ever invited into her bed. She was nuts about me. PROCTOR: You will have two hours to complete the exam. When you have finished the exam, close the booklet, turn it face downwards and raise your hands. When I have acknowledged you, you may bring the exam up to me and leave. You may begin. I had a new life all planned. Then with the opening of a door, (DOOR OPENING) every plan I had vanished. PROCTOR: Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word with you? Jacob, I'm afraid there's been a car accident. It's right in there, son. Is there any other family to call? No. No, it's just me. (COUGHS) HYDE: According to our records, there is no mistake, Mr: Jankowski. The house and all their assets, including your father's practice, are property of the bank in default of the loan. I'm telling you, you're wrong. My father owned that house outright. These documents are dated four years ago. He signed them. Did they need money for any reason four years ago? My tuition. Well, there you have it. Now, perhaps if you hadn't gone to college, you'd still have a home. But in light of the way your father ran his business, that's unlikely. My father was a good man. And when people came to him for help, he gave it. Your father was an irresponsible man who let people pay him in chickens, and eggs, and whatever they had instead of money. This Depression is with us for a very long while. Believe me. And the only people standing at the end of it will be the ones who take what they need to survive. Don't make the same mistakes as your father. JACOB: I remember walking out the front door and forcing myself not to look back. I couldn't stay where everything reminded me of the life that was gone. And I didn't see the point in going back to school. There were a lot of men in those days with no home, no family, leaving small towns that were dying. The rumor was that there were jobs in the cities, so I got it into my head that I'd walk to Albany. I never made it. (SIGHS) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (GRUNTING) CAMEL: Hey, don't be messing with Blackie! Throwing people off trains is one of the perks of his job. We don't need no bums on this train. Everybody, calm down here. Grady, put that damn pistol away. Blackie, let him go. And I mean on the inside of the train. I'm telling you, we don't need no trouble. I mean, look at them clothes. He ain't no bum. Don't be sore, kid. It's almost a reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel. That there is Grady and Wade. I'm Jacob. Jankowski. Jankowski? Gorski! (BOTH SPEAKING POLISH) (CHUCKLES) Mmm? You know, you're pretty young to be on the rails. You running from something maybe? No, no, nothing like that. Where you headed? I don't know. You hungry? Out of work? There's no shame in that. No shame in that. Well, what can you do? Just about anything, I guess. We land in Deposit in the morning. We'll get you some work for the day, and if you're still alive at the end of it, I will take you to see August, the Lord and Master of the Known and the Unknown Universe himself! Who's that? Hold on, chlopak, you're in for the ride of your life. (BRAKES SCREECHING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) (WORKERS CHATTERING) You see that? Wave, Olivia. - (LEADER SHOUTING) - (ALL GRUNTING IN UNISON) (ROARING) JACOB: Now, I don't know if I picked that train, or that train picked me. But something told me my mother and my father sent it my way. I'd like to think that, anyway. Hello, ma'am. CAMEL: Hey! What the hell are you doing in here? Get out of there! You ain't no menagerie man. Come on. I got you some work. - With the animals? - Oh, you betcha! (FLIES BUZZING) I've never seen so much manure. They pack them in 27 a car. (COUGHS) How do you stand the smell? What smell? (CHUCKLES) CECIL: Ladies and gentlemen! Step right this way to see the most dazzling collection of wonders, oddities and marvels of the natural world! Step right this way... When Cecil gives the signal, you gotta push the rubes in toward the entrance. Without them catching on, or else there'll be a fight. ...of pudgy perfection. (CROWD CHEERING) All for one thin dime. And believe me, it'll be the best dime you ever spent, I guarantee! Right this way! Hand your dime to this fella right here. Ladies to the right. Gentlemen to the left. Folks, just put one foot in front of the other, and the body will follow! Take this. Smack the sides with it if you see any heads trying to peek in without paying. (BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC) (MEN HOOTING) (ALL CHEERING) (BOTH EXCLAIM) Silver. That's right. Good boy. Good boy. Are you okay? You're shaking a little bit. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you mind if I take a look? (WHISTLE TWEETS) STAGE MANAGER: Performers to the Spec line! All performers to the Spec line! Walk on. Casey, move up. STAGE MANAGER: Showtime! Showtime! Move it up. Let's go! (BAND PLAYING FANFARE) Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages, welcome to the most extravagant extravaganza the human eye can behold! Welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! (EXCLAIMS) (ALL LAUGHING) JACOB: She didn't seem real to me at first. The way she looked inside that big top under those lights. I thought I'd go blind from the shine. Benzini Brothers outdid God himself. They created heaven in one day. And just as fast heaven was packed away and gone. Whoa, you better take a breath before it all comes back up on you. Here. (GRUNTS IN DISGUST) What is that? It's jake. It's all we got when there's no real hooch. Damn Prohibition. It don't seem American to deny a man a drink. Ain't it in the Constitution that a man has got a right to happiness? (CHUCKLES) Come on. I'll take you up to see August. Right now? It's the middle of the night. The only time circus people live, even the boss. See, musicians and sideshow people are above us roustabouts, but below the specialty acts, which, of course, are below the ring stock animals. And everybody, everybody, is below the bosses. Don't ever forget that. You wanna watch them clowns. Nobody ever gets a safe passage through here. Oh, Lucinda, my dear! Good evening. How are you? (CHUCKLES) Hello. You bring out the sunshine. Ooh. I know you. I saw you at my show. - Yeah? - Yeah. Want a private dance? (WOMEN LAUGHING) - How's your pipe, kid? - CAMEL: Barbara! Easy, now, Barbara. - Good night, ladies. - Good night, Camel. - (ALL EXCLAIM DISAPPOINTEDLY) - BARBARA: We like him, Camel. - Good night, Camel! - Good night! Now try not to talk till you're familiar with the vernacular, or you'll get your head bashed in. Like, townies are "rubes," and performers aren't performers. They're "kinkers," but never call them that to their faces. So what do I call them? Performers. Just don't talk to them at all. You'll live longer. to the ladies and... - Gentlemen. - MAN: Good evening. Hey, Camel, who's the woman who works with the horses? (SHUSHES) That ain't no woman. That's the boss's wife, Marlena. She's a star attraction. And she don't talk to nobody, and you don't talk to her. She'll just high- hat you anyway. You know, I got a son about your age lives outside of Reading, Pennsylvania. I haven't seen him in years. Fix your shirt there. Before we do this, I got to ask you, and I don't want to know your business, but I do know that you ain't been on the road too long. So before you start, I got to ask you, if you got any kind of life to go back to, that's what you should do. I don't. I am so sorry to hear that. Now, remember, when you meet August, let him do the talking. Don't go blowing your wig. And don't ever mention Ringling Brothers! He hates them bastards worse than the Depression. Now this here is Earl, and he's going to take you in. Earl, this here is Jacob. - Nice to meet you, Earl. - Yeah. (EARL CLEARING THROAT) AUGUST: What's this, Earl? The stowaway that Polack rummy took under his wing. College boy. AUGUST: I don't believe we had the pleasure. Jacob Jankowski, sir. So, what am I supposed to do with a Jacob Jankowski? I'm just looking for work, sir. - Ever worked a show, son? - No, sir. - Ever seen a show? - Yes, sir. Ringling Brothers. (THUMPS) Ringling, eh? Yeah, but it was terrible. Well, they do try, don't they, boys? (MEN LAUGH) You seen our show? Yes, sir. Yeah? What's your favorite act? I like the one with the black and white horses. You've got a good eye. My star attraction. Well, I do believe we're looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants. Aren't we, Joe? We don't have any elephants. That sounds perfect. I'd love to work with the animals. Come here. These from one day of work? Yes, sir. Why would a college boy dirty his hands as a filthy roustabout? I guess because out of all that dirt and sweat, working with these fellows you wouldn't be caught dead in the daylight with, comes so much beauty. You grandstanding me, kid? No. No, sir. That was beautifully put. Yet you ride my train, you eat my food without my permission while hard- working men labor all day for the same privileges. And these filthy roustabouts are my family. You, you are an intruder. Next stop, throw him off. - Probably studied poetry. - (MEN LAUGHING) I studied veterinary science, not poetry. And I can tell you one thing. That star attraction horse of yours? It's not gonna be walking in a few weeks, let alone performing. Earl? Wait. Veterinary sciences? - What school? - Cornell. You're a Cornell graduate? He did work the rubes for me this afternoon. He was pretty good. He shoveled horseshit all day. That don't make him no horse doctor. I'm sure Ringling has his own vet. Cornell, come with me. - You surefooted, Cornell? - Yeah. Good. JACOB: It's incredible. AUGUST: Takes your breath away, doesn't it? My star attraction is limping, and I can't get a new liberty horse midseason. So you make sure the horse performs, and the job is yours. Nine bucks a week. You do right by me, Cornell, I'll show you a life most suckers can't even dream of. Come on! Yeah, I could use an educated man around here. Gets pretty tiring talking to my menagerie of trained seals. Come on! - Kinko. - August. I have a roommate for you. - What is he? - Jacob. Jankowski. I asked what, not who. This gentleman is the show's new vet. Ivy League, no less, which puts him a good deal higher in my estimation than you. Perhaps you would like to offer him your cot. I'll find you in the morning to see about that horse, Cornell. That a Jack Russell? They're real smart. (BARKS) You're not getting the cot. - Darling, may I introduce to you... - MARLENA: Careful. Jacob. Jankowski. Jacob Jankowski, Benzini Brothers' very own Ivy League veterinarian. - He's the vet? - Yeah. Studied at Cornell University. The right front hoof. - It's an abscess. - Darling. AUGUST: It didn't look this bad in the show. You need a hoof tester? No, I don't think so. It needs heat and cold until it breaks, then it needs a salt wrap. It'll be fine. Come on, boy. - Help me in, Joe. Thank you. - JOE: Yep. MARLENA: Come on, boy. Well? (SIGHS) I didn't want to say anything in front of Mrs. Rosenbluth. The horse has laminitis. English. The connective tissue between the hoof and the coffin bone has been compromised. So when he walks, the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof until it punctures through. But it hasn't punctured yet. No, it hasn't, but it's just a matter of time. And he's in a lot of pain. How much time? Two, three days. He needs to be put down. You know all this by just looking at it? Is there nothing you can do? No. It's pretty severe. I'm sorry. Well, I appreciate it. Darling, Cornell here agrees with you. It's nothing really to worry about. Joe, get Pete to help Marlena. Pete's gonna feed the cats. No, we'll do that. You just take care of him. Come on. (FLIES BUZZING) They get a bucket each. Are you sure they like this stuff? It's gone bad. - (ROARS) - (LAUGHING) No. They like goats. We're all out of goats. Why don't you start with Rex here in the middle? What do I do, just open the door and toss it in? Unless you think a formal sit- down is more appropriate. (ROARING) Slow and quiet. He won't notice you're there. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Didn't they cover this in class? Place it in gently. Don't throw it. You don't want to startle him. (ROARS) (AUGUST LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) - You think that's funny? - Yes, I do. - I could have lost my arm. - No, you couldn't have. He doesn't have any teeth. (EXHALES) Does it hurt? Like this? Your gut tells you to shoot my star attraction? No treatment, no hoof tester, just your Cornell gut. You know how a circus survives? You said it yourself, kid. On blood, sweat, pain and shit. When a circus begins to die and animals eat garbage, you know what men eat? Nothing. Your heart goes out to an animal suffering. Well, that's noble, and that's good, but all that tells me is that you never saw men suffer. So before I get back from town, you do whatever it is they taught you in that Ivy League sandbox to get that horse ready for the parade. As long as we can walk, we play. It's not an abscess, is it? He's going to founder. It's okay, baby. (SNIFFLES) I should have taken him out of the show. It's not your fault. It happens. It's not uncommon, but he is suffering. And the pain is only gonna get worse. The right thing to do would be to put him down. That's not going to happen, is it? Not when August can get a few more shows out of him. Around here, everybody works till they're run into the ground. Nobody stops, nobody dies until August says so. (SOFTLY) It's okay, baby. What about August? I'm the vet. It's my decision. It'll be your last one. Listen, you should go. No, I'll keep him calm. Good boy. (SINGING) Hush, little baby, don't say a word (MARLENA SHUSHING) Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird (HUMMING) (GUNSHOT) (SOBS) Are you all right? I'll be all right. Mr. Jankowski. I'll be sorry to see you go. Roll over. Turn around. Turn around. Good girl. Sit. Good girl. Up! Up! Up, Queenie! (JACOB GRUNTING) This circus, my circus, is a sovereign nation. You break my law, you have to pay a penalty. I tell you to fix a horse, you shoot it? That's breaking my law. The penalty is red- lighting. You need to get off the train. Except we don't stop the train. There's a chance you might survive, although unlikely. - Mr. Rosenbluth, just let me explain. - No, no. No need! You took initiative. I respect that. But I'm a law- abiding man. Toss him. - Wait! - On three. No, wait! No, no, no! - MEN: One. Two. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Three! The only reason you're not a permanent part of this landscape right now is because you probably saved my Marlena from injury, and you solved a great problem for me. You saw what we fed the cats. It wasn't right, was it? But now because of you, Silver Star will make sure the cats will eat good fresh meat until we can sell some tickets. But you killed my star act, so if we don't sell the tickets and the men aren't paid, they're going to be looking for someone to blame. Welcome to the circus, Cornell. JACOB: We had to cancel shows in three towns. The rumor was, four men got tossed to save money. And we might go belly up. Dead circuses were common in '31. Men tired of being mistreated would mutiny, or bosses would see the end coming and pull a runner with all the money, leaving a mess of animals and acts like bones to be picked over. Luckily, we found one in Goshen. And August could get any act for a song. The rest of them knew they'd never work another show again. When I saw their faces, I thought to myself, August was right. I'd never seen men hungry. Darling! One second, please. Erwin, over here. Joe, pour the champagne. I want you all to experience the earthquake impact of what I'm about to show you. I've made an acquisition that will make Benzini Brothers a top- drawer tour. - Darling. - Yes. I know I could never truly replace Silver Star for you, but I hope you'll give me a chance to try. Oh, August, you didn't need to do that. Joe, the doors? Children, meet our salvation! We got ourselves a guaranteed sell- out, crowd- cheering bull! Her name is Rosie, she's 53, and she's brilliant. What's that in her mouth? She ran off. They found her eating a cemetery plot. I'm going to come up with a whole new star act around you and her. Darling, I'm not getting up on that. I've never ridden an elephant in my life! You didn't know how to stand on top of a galloping horse until I showed you. You're a fast learner. This act will go through the roof! (SOFTLY) Where the hell are we gonna put it? - We'll make room. - How are we gonna pay for it? I won't pay the men for a few weeks. We've done it before. Once we start selling out, the men will have more cash than they know what to do with. She's gonna pack them in. I know it! You the bull man? He's my menagerie man. You ain't got no bull man, I gotta tell the township, or else I can't sell her to you. Well, I'm the bull man. Well, speak up! I ain't got all day. You see this animal? This here is the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of God's good earth. Here's your bull hook. You're going to need it. Good luck to you. If I don't ever see another dumb bull in my life, it'll be too soon. (JACOB LAUGHS) AUGUST: Cornell, give her a once- over. Darling, get acquainted. You two are gonna make history. Robinson? Come on. Let's pick a car we can renovate. I think he's lost his mind. Do you have any idea how hard it is to break in a new act? (LAUGHING) My name is Jacob Jankowski. - How do you do? - And this is... (BOTH LAUGHING) Marlena Rosenbluth. You're a beauty. Your skin's a little dry. Maybe you should take care of that. The first thing you notice about a woman's age is her skin. Oh, great. Just what we need around here, another lush. Well, you're welcome. Is this the way elephants flirt? Would you two like to be alone? (JAZZ SONG PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH) I think she likes music. It is a lovely song. I'm confessing that I love you. Hmm? Uh, it's the name of the song. (CHUCKLES) Oh, right, of course. Louis Armstrong. Well, I guess now's as good a time as any, right, bull man? Let's get up there! It's sink or swim around here. Can you help me with this ladder? August once dropped me in the middle of this monkey act. The meanest monkeys you've ever met. They were biting me during the entire performance, and I had to just smile and act like it was part of the act. Oh, gosh. Good grief. Well, I think it's very important to form an offstage relationship. How do I look? Silly, right? No. You two were made for each other. She really is beautiful. (QUEENIE BARKING) - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - MARLENA: Come in! (LIVELY JAZZ SONG PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH) Oh, Jacob. So glad you could come and celebrate our new beautiful elephant. Is something wrong? I feel a little underdressed. Nonsense. I told you, nothing but the best for our very own Cornell graduate vet. Which, I might add, those Ringling bastards do not have. I checked. Voil?. I thought you could use some new threads and a shave. Can't have my Ivy League vet smelling like his patients. - Can you mess that up? - Yes, of course. Perfection. When I started with Benzini, this show was nothing but grift. A man couldn't walk a straight line through the midway without getting his pocket picked half a dozen times. Benzini was a cheap bastard. He didn't invest a dime in new acts. So when he pulled a runner, everybody thought we were belly- up. Mmm- mmm. Not me. - And you were 19, right, darling? - Uh- huh. And August got rid of all the pickpockets and the grift barkers, and he sold off two deadbeat clowns and a train car so he could buy Lucinda, our lovely fat lady. - And Rex. - Rex. But you kept the coochie girls, didn't you? No denying they're good revenue. (LAUGHS) - It's true. - I needed money. So I had to scavenge every dead circus for every act we have. But you didn't have to buy me, did you? No. - I had to marry you. - That's right. - Were you a performer? - (LAUGHS) No. August taught me everything I know. And he told me that one day we'd be as big as Ringling Brothers. Yeah. Those damn brothers had a stroke of genius. They sold families the idea they wanted a show their mother and sisters could see. No sex, no grift. Safe for the kids. And nobody can touch their bookings. But we're on our way. Yeah, this bull? This bull has got to be spectacular! I take care of the spectacle. Now I need someone to take care of the bull. August wants you to be the bull man. You'll have full charge of training Rosie. With a raise. Modest raise. You'll hardly notice it. I don't know anything about elephants. I'm going to tell him the truth. Some outfit will be feeding off our carcass if we don't bring in the people. And I mean crowds falling over their feet to get inside our big top. This bull has got to work, Jacob. She's got to. I need to tell you something. I'm not sure you'll trust me after you hear it. I never finished Cornell. I'm not a real vet. I didn't get my degree. I'm not licensed. Jacob, do you think Lucinda the Fat Lady weighs 800 pounds? (LAUGHS) She's 400 at the tops. Do you think the Tattooed Woman was tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? MARLENA: She's from Pittsburgh! It took her nine years to ink herself. Tell him about the hippo, darling. When she died, we swapped out her water for formaldehyde, kept showing her. For two weeks we traveled with a pickled hippo! Jacob, the world's run on tricks. Everyone plays. But it's having a true talent, a gift born within, something no degree can give you... You have such a talent. You knew with one look about Silver Star. You must learn, my dear boy, that the rules of these United States of Suckers do not apply to us. To talent and illusion! To Rosie. - To Rosie. - To all we love. (I NEED A LITTLE SUGAR IN MYBOWL PLAYING) Tired of bein'lonely Tired of bein'blue I wished I had some good man To tell my troubles to I need a little sugar in my bowl Darling. Be gentle, darling. We have a guest. August. August. August. You don't know your own strength, darling. I'm right here. I'm right here. Come on, let's get you to bed. Come on. Come here. Excuse us, Jacob. Move your finger Drop something in my bowl I need a little steam- heat on my floor Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go Get off your knees I can't see what you're drivin'at! It's dark down there! Looks like a snake Come on here and drop somethin'here in my bowl Stop your foolin' And drop somethin'in my bowl Is everything all right? Yes. He's just had too much to drink. Bessie Smith. Wish I could sing like that. Should I leave? No, I want to dance. (SLOW JAZZ SONG PLAYING) Come on, just dance with me one time, and I'll let you go home. Come on. I hope you had fun tonight. August really likes you. He could use a friend. We both could. It's a pretty song. Don't tell him what happened. No, no. I would never do that. That's the name of the song. Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me. - The song? - (CHUCKLES) Yes. Jacob. You should go. I think you should go. All right. Good night. (PLAYING BLUES MUSIC) (ALL EXCLAIMING) Brava, Queenie! Brava! This is my new friend and roommate, Jacob! (ALL CHEERING) I'd like you all to make him feel at home. I'd love to make you feel at home. (PEOPLE WHOOPING) (MEN WHISTLING) (WHOOPS) Oh, yeah! Come on. CECIL: Nice legs, sister! Hello, beautiful! What the hell did I do last night? You threw up on Barbara. (SCRATCHING) Your balls itchy? Yeah, they are. Thank you for doing that. It'll grow back. In patches. What's wrong with Queenie? What do you mean, wrong? I mean, she's not hating me. Something's wrong. She must've eaten something. Try getting some honey from the cookhouse, and if you can, some slippery elm powder. And if that doesn't work, we can check her for parasites tomorrow if you want. My real name's Walter, by the way. Good morning. I forgot how big you were. All right, you want to get to work? Huh? Okay. (GROWLING) All right, you have to take it easy with me today. I'm not in the best form. You feel like walking? MARLENA: Wild party, I hear. I've forgotten most of it. Seems like the rest of these guys haven't, though. About last night, I... It was just the champagne. What was? You're new at this, aren't you? When a woman gives it to you straight, don't give her a line like you don't remember. All right. I meant what I said about us being friends. (CHUCKLES) Where are you going? Good morning, children. - Morning, darling. - Where were you? I woke up early to train with the girls. Clearly your charms are very effective on a lovesick pachyderm. Too bad they were less successful with Barbara. Barbara? I didn't... Word has it you didn't, though you gave it the old Cornell try. - Can we get on with this, please? - Yes, of course. Now, Cornell, when it comes to working with a bull, charm's the last thing required. You know, any living creature needs to know who's in charge. They can sense when a man's power is, shall we say, in full strength, and when a man's power is, shall we say, not. First of all, can't do anything with a bull without a bull hook, can you? And with it, you must claim the role of master immediately. (LAUGHS) Okay. You use it there, right above her shoulder. And you use your full voice to command. Rosie, walk! - Rosie, move, walk! - Now jab her! She needs to know you mean it. Rosie, walk. Rosie, walk, come on. Rosie, walk! Watch me. Back off. Up. Up. Forward! (BELLOWING) Forward! Move! Up! Up! Move! Up! Move! Up! Up! Move! (WHIMPERING SOFTLY) (DOOR OPENING) (BELLOWING) Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages, welcome to the most extravagant extravaganza the human eye can behold! Welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! (BAND PLAYING MARCH) (CROWD CHEERING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) (DISTANTLY) Move up! Up! (INAUDIBLE) Up! Move! (BELLOWING) (TRUMPETING) (DRUM ROLLING) (CROWD CHEERING) (CYMBALS CRASH) (PLAYING MARCH) ROUSTABOUT: In the big top! Come on! - You all right? - Yeah. I just landed funny on my heel. Get that damn bull before we're driven out of town. Don't forget the bull hook. CAMEL: Jacob? Some of the boys saw her heading for town. I'll help you, kid. Come on. (CROWD CHATTERING) JACOB: Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am. This yours? CAMEL: Yeah, we'll take care of it, Officer. Don't you worry. Thank you. GROCER: My cabbage! You pay for those, eh? JACOB: I'm sorry, sir. I'll get out of here in two minutes. CAMEL: Oh, they just love booze. (LAUGHS) One whiff of this, and she ain't thinking about corn anymore! WOMAN: Did you see that? CAMEL: Got this from Wade and Grady. Bastards been holding out on me. - Hey, mister! To pay? - I will. I will! Kills me, wasting it on a goddamn pachyderm. (TOASTING IN POLISH) Oh! This damn leg of mine. Is she following? - JACOB: Yeah, she's following. - Uh- huh. Good. Evening. - You okay? - I'm fine. I have a sore wrist. A bruised heel. I'll be fine. But I think August could use a drink. Maybe you should take him out, Jacob. Get him to relax a bit. Did you catch that bull? Yeah, I got her back in her car eventually. Good. August? August! August! Don't! - August! August! - Stop! August! She was good! She was good. She came back on her own. She just needs more time. She wasn't ready yet. Hey! (BELLOWING) (GRUNTING) Stop it! Stay down, kid. I mean it! (AUGUST GRUNTING) (PANTING) (BELLOWS SOFTLY) We need to get a lot of whiskey. I don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place. He shouldn't have the right if you ask me. Marlena! Did Marlena send you? No. She doesn't want to see me. She won't talk to me. She won't forgive me this time. Maybe you can talk to her. I know there is no excuse for what I did. - Is she all right, Rosie? - She could use some whiskey. Yeah, yeah. Here, take all I've got. (BOTTLES CLINKING) Take it. Will you tell her? Marlena? Tell her what? I saw the bull rear up and run away with her, and I lost my mind. That's no excuse. I know that. I've spent all that money on that bull. I need to pay the workmen. I have debts to pay. I need to sell tickets. And that bull is useless. If I lose Marlena, you understand, I'll lose all of this. What were you planning on doing with that bull hook? Jacob? Are you sure that's not too much? She might get drunk. She weighs four tons. She just gets sleepy. She can barely move as it is. She'll be fine. (CONSOLING IN POLISH) I don't know what to do, Camel. He'll kill her next time. There's nothing you can do. A man like that. He throws men off a moving train so he don't have to pay. You think he thinks twice about killing one of God's innocent creatures? - Can you pass me the other rag? - Mmm? - It's under your foot. - Oh... Lift your leg. Lift your leg. (REPEATS IN POLISH) (SPEAKING POLISH) I want you to read these out loud to Rosie. - (SPEAKING POLISH) - (REPEATING) Might help if he said "please." Say... (SPEAKING POLISH) - What does that mean? - Just try it. (REPEATING IN POLISH) Now the next one. (SPEAKING POLISH) (AUGUST REPEATING) - (JACOB SPEAKING POLISH) - (REPEATING) (PLAYING LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC) The only really authentic miracle is success. Washes away all sins. Don't you think? Just the thought of it makes all things right. Anyway, to Rosie, our big, fat, beautiful bull's- eye of a star attraction. - I need to get some more champagne. - Let me get it. No. Sit! My party. It's good seeing him like this. Looks like it's gonna be standing room only from now on. You know how many star acts we've had that packed them in? How much money we've made and lost, and made and lost? Silver Star paid for our new stateroom, and look what happened to him. Why do you stay with him? I was born a passenger. They found me wrapped in a newspaper under a seat on the Baltimore and Ohio. I was just three days old. I grew up in foster homes. I'd always daydream about who my parents were. When I was five, for an entire year, I pretended my mom was an Appaloosa mare. I did. And that I was a filly, and that I was just dreaming that I was a girl. And that one day I'd wake up, and I'd run home. One thing was for sure, I was a lot safer in those stables than I ever was in those homes. And then the circus came to town. And there they were, these six gorgeous black Friesians with red tassels hanging down their manes. So beautiful. And August was right out front. And as soon as he looked at me, I knew I'd never live with strangers again. So we got married. And where did I end up? Living on a train. It's the only real home I've ever known. And you know, I'm a star attraction. Out there, I got nothing just like everybody else. You're a beautiful woman. You deserve a beautiful life. That's all there is to it. Where were you when I was 17, huh? (HOT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Let's dance. (MUSIC FADES) - (DOOR BANGS OPEN) - This is a raid! (ALL CLAMORING) Raid! Marlena! Marlena! MARLENA: Jacob! POLICEMAN: Hey! Hold it right there! This way! (CHUCKLING) - You all right? - That was really close. I ripped my stockings. They were silk, too. Who cares? I don't know how we're going to find our way back, especially if we don't find August. We should probably go look for him, right? Don't follow me. JACOB: I told myself, let her go. She'll tell August that I got lost in the crowd. It's the best thing for her. It's the best thing for everybody. I just couldn't do it. Rosie... I convinced myself I had to stay to protect Rosie. To protect Marlena. Because August couldn't be trusted. (SIGHS) (SPEAKING POLISH) When the truth was maybe I was the man who couldn't be trusted. Hey. Hey. Something's wrong with Camel. Come on. Hey, kid. How nice to see you. Hey, Camel. - What's wrong? - I don't know. I woke up this morning, and my feet was all floppy. I just can't feel them right. And it's not just that, though. There's other stuff, too. - Like down there? Man stuff? - Yeah. What's wrong with him, Doc? It's jake leg. I've seen it before. No such thing, is there, Doc? Manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in this to get around regulations that Jamaican ginger extract not be sold as booze. You're not supposed to drink this stuff, you know? What the hell am I supposed to drink to stop the shakes? It's Prohibition. I ain't no Astor. It's okay, Camel. Tomorrow's payday. We'll get you some moonshine. Don't lie to the man. If we were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't have red- lighted nine men. That can't be true. Nine men disappear between Goshen and Weehawken? And we didn't make no stops. Is he gonna get better? WADE: Earl or Blackie see Camel like this, it's over. We need to get him out of sight, Jacob. All right. Jacob, in a week, he's not gonna be able to move his legs at all. Listen. He told me he has a son in Reading. We play there in three weeks. Three weeks. That's all he needs. Blackie and his men don't patrol performer cars. - Good morning. - Hey. - Do you mind if I sit? - Not at all. Can we speak privately later? Why? Is something the matter? I just wanted to apologize about what happened last night. That's silly, Jacob. Why would you apologize? You weren't even there. I explained to August what happened as best I could remember it. Champagne just overwhelms my senses. I remember there was a crowd, and people were pushing. And I was running, and I fell and tore my stockings. AUGUST: Morning, children! That was quite an adventure we had last night. Thanks, Pauley. Glad I didn't have to bail you out of jail. How'd you get home? - I took the ferry. - Brilliant and cheap. Good man. I slept like a baby after last night. - Thank you, my darling! - August, please, we're in public. What? Nothing to be ashamed of. Man and wife reuniting in their marriage bed? It's a sacred act. My Marlena has forgiven me. All's well with the world again. (AUGUST COMMANDING IN POLISH) Now, in a circle. (JACOB SPEAKING POLISH) (REPEATING) Beautiful, Jacob. You know, I was really worried about you two last night. If anything had happened to Marlena, if anyone had harmed her or as much as touched her, I hate to think of it. Now let's bring her back in. - (COMMANDS IN POLISH) - (REPEATS) (COMMANDS IN POLISH) JACOB: If August knew anything about that night, you'd never know it. All he seemed to care about was Rosie, and God love her, she played her part to a T. We all did: Everything went back to how it was before. At least, that's how it looked. But nothing was the same. August was right again. Everything is an illusion. (ALL EXCLAIM) CHILDREN: Come on! (COMMANDING IN POLISH) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (CROWD LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT) (WHOOPS) (CROWD CHEERING) JACOB: With straw house sell- outs, August promised the men he'd finally pay them with increases, once his debts were covered. Success had made a new man out of August, they all said. But I watched him, and I knew it was just a matter of time. (BLOWING WHISTLE) Shh! Children. The circus is nothing without its traditions. It's a family. And like any family, when a new member is born, its arrival has to be greeted with celebration and with gratitude. Now I know we've all been kind of busy lately with sold- out performances. Thank the gods! (ALL CHEERING) Shh! But right now, I want to take this moment before today's show to gather together. We close our eyes and we thank whoever's up there that sends desperate men running for the rails. (ALL LAUGHING) Because it was a lucky day when Jacob Jankowski jumped our train. It is because of his discovery that we have the greatest star attraction in the Benzini Brothers' history! Shh! And so, to officially welcome him into our family, we open our eyes, and we give him the traditional Benzini Brothers baptism! (ALL CLAMORING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Congratulations, Jacob. (WHISPERING) Will you bring Rosie to my tent after this? And don't tell anyone, okay? Where do you want her? Oh, if you could stake her right there, that would be great. I'm planning a little surprise for August. I've never seen the company so happy before. Maybe we will give Ringling Brothers a run for their money. Do you need anything else? No, thank you. Um, actually... - Thank you. - Sorry. (MARLENA CHUCKLES) AUGUST: So, what's this? Oh, this is for you. Surprise! Congratulations, darling. Thank you, my darling. Jacob, where are you going? It's your thing. No, please join us. Come. - Marlena. - (STAMMERS) Of course. To August, a genuine miracle man for making a star attraction out of me. Many thanks. Many thanks to both of you. And forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise. I could go back out. Give you more time. Or better yet, I could yell "Raid!" and clear the place out. In fact, it gave me an idea for the show. A new act. This is the story. A first dance. Two characters. A young awkward man, hopelessly in love with a woman beyond his reach, who teases his affections. Hmm? We start with a romantic melody that sweeps them onto the dance floor. He wraps his arms around her. He wraps his arms around her. Come on. Please, indulge me. I'm inspired. The audience will love it! Yes. Now, they look into each other's eyes. - August... - Look at him! She touches his cheek. And gently runs her hand down his neck, playing with his hair. Never leaving his eyes. Never leaving his eyes. Making him believe she's his. He slides his hand lower and lower, below her waist. But she slaps his wrist as if to protect her honor against this rude Lothario. (CHUCKLES) That's it! The audience will eat it up. They love the illusion. They'll never guess you have no honor to protect. August. Please. It's funny how things pan out. I've always known the kind of woman you really are. Sitting in front of your dress shop, watching the parade. Those little- girl- lost eyes. This beautiful, almost translucent skin. Well, translucent to me. I could always see straight through you. I'm sorry to say that you're really a very common type, darling. Marlena, we should go. Is that the plan? - You're leaving me for him? - No. - You must be special. No? - August, please. If he doesn't mean anything to you, tell me to fire him. Fire him. Tell me to unleash Blackie and his men to teach him a lesson not to touch my things. Marlena. Marlena, it's all right. Jacob, just go. Ooh. Dissention in the ranks! Betrayal trumps lust! That's what sells tickets, kids! August, look at me. Look. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. - Do you want to leave me? - No. But I'm your wife. I'm not one of your things. Prove it. Look at me! Nothing is going on. Nothing. Do you hear me? I'll never leave you. Of course, an innocent woman wouldn't have to get on her knees. But you can't help it, can you? Just force of habit for a woman like you. (MARLENA GROANS) (BOTH GRUNTING) Boss! The rubes. Walk away now, or this will get a lot worse a lot faster! I got him! Okay? I got him. (JACOB COUGHING) The only thing keeping you alive right now are those rubes. August hates witnesses. CAMEL: Oh, jeez, kid, what did you do? I'm not leaving her with him. - KINKO: Get in! Shut the door! - I have to find her! You go after her, and August can have you shot, and nobody can stop him. Look, you just got fired. Makes you a trespasser. (POUNDING ON DOOR) MARLENA: Jacob. Are you all right? (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) The girls overheard August giving Blackie the order. They're coming after you as soon as we start to move. You have to get off this train right now. (TRAIN RUMBLING) Go. If we don't get too far, there's a hotel in Salem. - But don't stay longer than the night. - Just come with me. What? You think there's nothing out there for you, but there is. You just can't see it. Jacob, you don't understand. I can't. He'll find me. Marlena, there's a better kind of life that's meant for you. Whether that life is with me or not, or whether you love me or not, it doesn't matter. But it's got to be now. (MARLENA SIGHS) How long have I been asleep? We can't stay here, Jacob. We have to keep moving. Hey, don't worry. We'll get the first bus out of here. We'll make our way to Ithaca. I'll call my dean, take my finals. We do whatever job we can until my license comes in, and then we go to Ringling. Ringling's a tough act to break into. - You can't just walk through the door. - No, no, no. Not if we offer ourselves as a team. You as a performer, me as a vet. That's a pretty sweet deal, right? You think they'll take it? MARLENA: No! No! No! BLACKIE: Someone's coming. (GROANS) ROUSTABOUT 1: Easy, up. ROUSTABOUT 2: Come on. Mind yourself. Get that branch. Get back on. Come on. We're losing time. Come on. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (WHISPERING) Walter. Camel? (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTS) (MOUTHING) CECIL: Ladies and gentlemen! Step this way! Just follow the sound of my voice! Don't be shy! Plenty of time before the big show starts in the big top! Jacob. It's okay. I don't have much time. Where's Walter? Where's Walter and Camel? When we jumped the train last night, August went crazy. He had Blackie red- lighting men all night. Wade and Grady hit soft ground, and they found Walter and Camel. They had hit the rocks. They didn't make it. Wade and Grady are gonna take August down. I don't know how, but you have to get out of here. I'll stay hidden until the matinee starts. Then I'll make my way to town. There's got to be a church or something. There is. You do the Spec, but when the show starts, come and meet me. August won't know you're gone until the second act. - So we'll get a head start. - I have to go. Marlena, just promise me you'll come. Or I'll come back for you. I swear it. I'll be there. I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages, welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! (BAND PLAYING MARCH) (CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY) (BAND STOPS PLAYING) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (CROWD SCREAMING) ROUSTABOUT 1: Something's wrong. ROUSTABOUT 2: Everybody to the big top! Come on. ROUSTABOUT 3: Where's it coming from? Barbara, take Queenie! ROUSTABOUT 4: The cats are loose! Get them! (ANIMALS SNARLING) (CROWD CLAMORING) (MAN SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) Daddy! (WHINNYING) MAN: Move! Move! No! Marlena! Marlena! (BOTH GRUNTING) (YELLS) (SCREAMING) Marlena! (BELLOWING) Marlena! Rosie... (BELLOWING) Rosie! (GASPING) (TRUMPETING) (GROANS) (GASPING) JACOB: The official report said August had been trampled to death. Blackie was never seen again after Wade and Grady dragged him out of that tent. And no one was charged with letting the animals out of those cages. To the police, it could have been anyone. Benzini Brothers was officially belly up, property of Altoona, Pennsylvania. Shows on the road would get the scent soon enough and come to pick off our bones. I wouldn't leave Rosie to that. I wasn't gonna let anybody touch her with that hook again. So like I planned, I took my finals. OLD JACOB: And with my degree, our animals, and Marlena's act, Ringling got themselves a sweet deal. A sweet deal. Our first son was born that season. Walter. He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling. That's why I cannot understand how he could forget to show up today. There was a circus in town! By the time our third son came, we'd had enough. Rosie was tired. Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo dropped dead, so I got the job. We bought some property so we could keep the horses, Rosie, and then five kids. Oh, before you know it, the kids are borrowing the car and moving out. So then it was just Rosie and us. When Rosie passed on, Marlena cried for days. We owed Rosie our whole lives. And Marlena? My Marlena died in her bed. Still beautiful, though. We had a lot of years, though. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to give her everything I promised. And, boy, that was the life! (CHUCKLING) Boy, I'm telling you! Are you hiring me? I don't know. What about your health? There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just old. Work is the best thing for age. A man like me ought to be working the ticket wicket, not some kid ringed up like a sideshow act. And if you don't think I'm carrying my weight, you can call the home. I won't argue. You won't be sorry. Yeah, we'll get you in the record books. "Oldest man that ever ran away with the circus." (LAUGHS) I'm not running away. I'm coming home. (INAUDIBLE)
