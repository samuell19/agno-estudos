I travel. Something is wrong I do not feel well. I came back here A few days ago, in this poor country, This split of the country battles There's little war The rebels blew up power. Our hotel foresight provide candles. Sit on these cold square tiles in the cold night Cold in hand and I can not stand. At this point I see myself removed how to watch myself. Remove seems like most people. For example I pretend to fully my neighbors. If you agree with the external facts about me. The main thing is that I've never raised the question of external facts. I can easily present a whole life in one thin book. A book never read because ... would be too boring. Chapter 1 I was born. I went to school. Chapter 2 Rest. I got married, had children, are divorced. Worked, work, entertainment holidays, parties, calls, clothing but it was not me. What difference have I, this is my private life. What I think about things how I feel about things what I like. I love Beytan. I love to watch violinist playing with strings. At night I like to go to Cosmopolitan, where I lived all my life. City where born and my children grew up. I love the city lights Cafes, bookstores, theaters I love to sit in a dark box and watching dancers migration in the end. 30 years ago when I was a kid Did you know My parents loved me and taught me to think about people. World humanity, beauty. And they gave me a book for people with many different uniforms who came home to help my family postman with a mail supplier of store and all so polite, even the street where we live there are so many things to watch and at the end of the street a strange old woman works in the bakery, which gives me a chocolate muffin. Parents told me about wonderful trip. I remember a marvelous train, imagining that travel through night at the ranch real surprise. When I think of childhood I remember Christmas and wonderful gifts. There's always had a box that was so perfect as we thought might to have someone inside but it was just too much. And when you open the box Inside was another box which was always a shiny package. And finally come to the gift. Sometimes it was small object which could be very beautiful wooden object but in the meantime without any doubt with all its splendor, seemed the most radiant thing in the world. How fine it seemed how fragile, how precious. My friends and I also were exquisite, priceless and fragile children. And he always knew knew him because of the way for taking care of us. Our beds were furnished with soft sheets, Our shoes and socks with soft to keep our feet. My dear mother told us, you must be very careful. Do not go to play below the railway station there are bad people from the neighborhood. Good people kept us in our neighborhood very good neighbors but as the railway station in other regions bad people gathered together. And all the neighbors shun them, because poor people and fighting people. Still circumvent them by my friends, bad neighborhoods. People who live in places like these, will hurt, I'll beat up, I'll stab will kill you. Bad people gather in these neighborhoods, as rain water. I always detour Dangerous places but had to come back here Even if I felt I the floor in the bathroom, in this country no books written my language numbers written after the street Is it dull finish the story of my life. I'm not sure why But something started happening to me after I went in Europe. I began to learn certain things of which was not paying attention. Maybe It all began one day when I was in art gallery You see dear, are rich pigs, so it's simple. What? All right? - Just say it. The woman there was clearly seedy Spotting all professed by Marx. She can not speak so for the rich. Say that tells us that the way use science is the same. I know ordinary people are terrible and I know a few rich, are extremely pleasant. I do not care whether pleasant or not. What I say is that anything to do with the world all of which deal, suppress society. And when you are miles with officers or miles with dogs miles with friends or miles with any f. The ruling class is ruling class. I've heard these words and phrases throughout their lives, but I never met someone to use them. And then wherever you go looking for people to think for the same things who said the woman from the gallery. Go for it, take it, unprecedented opportunity. land bargains what a joke. But one day, course, someday. help us to pay it. I began to think that maybe I'm crazy. I thought this was unreasonable, really is happening. All except us are greedy bastards. Now I am all you are communists? But communism is dead a long time. Now it appears that was reborn again. Why are all these people old age trying to take from me. One day I found an anonymous gift complex input staircase. Joke, I seriously, I do not think. I lay down tonight and started her unteach The beginning was invincible I could not figure it out. When I reached the section lives of workers workers from the factories. I felt how I started breathe more slowly. How scary it was, Hate on the pages. Then I came back again to previous section to try to figure out not what I was before. Weird, disturbing or ugly phrases cult to mainstream products. I tried to tell them these phrases, but I can say to understand that my entire life must be totally changed. He explains that every single thing depending on the types, expressed by its value. This cup of coffee, this time this coat. Everything has its value or is part of something else. We say that the coat is not part this kind of stuff because we believe that the coat even doubt that piece of clothing it has its own soul this is a cult idol. live spirit. But what really is the origin the value of the coat. The price of the coat comes from history history of the people involved in producing and selling their and the mode of communication, who had And buy coats we form relationships with these people. And if you try to hide that our relationships, then pretend that we live in a world without history. Just frustrating to heaven with more profit for us. We say we like this coat, because it is expensive. And if it is a fact that for a coat it is not the end of history for all people who make and sell them. For 2 days I saw cult to mainstream goods everywhere in the streets. This is quite a strange feeling. Then on the fourth day I lost it, it disappeared, I could not see him anymore. How long are you waiting for? - Almost half an hour. - Maybe something is wrong. - Yes. Your earrings are beautiful. - Thank you. Write anything on them? What does it mean? Well, I guess that the closest meaning would be if people are united, they will not be injured. So simple. Where did you get them? That was a gift from my friends from my village. She told me that they come from a country they have visited. When I saw the joy on their faces, people gathered together I was surprised and really ... Place for which I know nothing. ... When the plane went down I was overwhelmed by these unusual colors, their flavor people who are ... How I described the her trip. This is an old coin Virginia they are not used, so that they make me feel beautiful. This was not my bus. 6 months later I went to a party which I took many drinks. After the party, I did not want to drink for quite a while. What are you doing here? Absolutely nothing. Fee you waiting for? Are you a friend Phyllis? - No, Jake. Jake, marble substrate. What does this mean? This Jake is very short name for it. Finally. Please come. - Thanks. Hey, man. Can I kindle. No, sorry. - Okay. Can it not kindle a light. There you go. Can I ask you a question? - Of course, any f. I could not understand your accent. Where are you from? From a small country ... I It turned out that he comes from the same party where have pierced woman from the bus stop. A few years ago they killed each other. The war left a mark in their hearts in their desires. He served as ambassador. Now everything was wonderful And they can to indulge in dreams, to live together can dream together They are all wonderful people wonderful. Is it difficult to go in your country. Not at all. There are direct flights to the capital 3 times a week Really? - Yes. Do you plan any trip soon? Well, sometimes close his office. You can visit us now safe, trust me. You see this beautiful country. I had a vision of how I sat the plane if I had decided to go. At the end of the month, I told my office that will take leave for several weeks. And I went to the airport to wait for the flight. Welcome to our country, pleasant day. - Thank you. Ambassador told me that a friend with legal revolutionaries in the country. I know that visitors can being misled by ocharovatelnostta of this place managed by the brutal regime. I never believed in the revolution because I think power may itself elect necessary leaders. They were more soldiers It is undisputed but more like live shepherds of Renaissance paintings. Where is the tourist office? - Yes, I know. I met an employee who invited me in his office to talk. He said the government takes from people to have more food for them. before the revolution obey only two people and now many people work and their divide everything. You can see that one of the problems we have here is that most people in the streets no names, and sometimes is very difficult to find people. and therefore most of our people have the same families. How to fix? - Very difficult. Of all these folders here each represents a village where more than 90% people can not read, this is amazing. And then ocharovatelnostta People enchant me. I went there with my husband. This must have been a nice trip. - It was. Well, in this country I am more 10 years. Really? I read in newspapers that people move elsewhere. Yes, my boss tried to me give another good place, but I do not know me I like it here. When my sister moved, I gave up. There is always a magazine in which to work. I also like this place even though the ice cream is so open, so clean and beautiful and we can get this ice cream home, even the best place. Yes, dear. They are very proud of their ice cream. But, you know that milk ice cream really necessary for children and not much of it here. - No? The truth is that government argued that that most people in the world understand what is happening in this country. So hotels only because the Ministry of Tourism actually take all milk. Because the profits of the country more like make a good impression of visitors like you than to give milk children what they need. I do not know, I guess they have the right, but I do not think so dying people's revolution. They have tried to share this with world through visitors and this is a form of ice cream communication This is the truth, They have tried to show What kind of society would like to build someday. They never had no economy I really use and better society to be full of good things. in the sense of contrast terrible statistics between rich and other people countries, I guess. Have you seen such nonsense. - No, I have been in other countries in the region. Oh, really! You should go, to see at least 2 of them otherwise you can not appreciate what make a revolution here. If only cross the border 3 km north of here will see the places under the control armies of death squads where people do not even dream of change. Instigation of the facts, of course, they say they have a democracy and make choices every Four years. Elections for the people, I say this? Oh, no. Indeed, elections are remarkably honest. Just over the years leaders intervene elections, and they can not be made to change for U.S. forces here. Works very well. That's why I'm here. Watch revolution. People face every day. go to work for the benefit the rich. And no one believes that they want be different. I read that the country was terrorized of the death squads and I never wanted to see one of them. But I was intrigued by this what you say. I decided that we should see them in person. Journalists advised me to visit the respective office where to collect evidence what happens day after day. We try to keep records in cases of political killings and torture. Also rape rapists use system to torture specific system of torture. This is my friend We went to school together then she became a teacher. She said that they need from school. Te shot in January to school in. - Why? This was the choice for some people that the fight is the only way. She was murdered by people who feared go to the funeral in. But they went anyway. People from my office told an interesting church which could visit on Sunday. He knew there permanently a young woman. Ella. Thank you. - It's okay. Well you've come. You speak English. Yes, less than college. Cover your head. Then the priest began to talking excitedly. I felt that we should speak for terrible things. Violent death. He says we must learn to forgive your enemies Even if we look hard and much impossible. He says that God loves infinite mercy and and we must be the same. I'm afraid that must be back. Well, there is a bus stop, which is not far away. Povarvyahme together for less and stopped at a farm. The government ordered bitterly set fire to barns and kill all the animals. Then the rape and beatings girls. and then hanged them. They made it from there. He said he is interested in music what not to learn English University? When was that? I did not think I have enough talent to devote to music. And after university I went to France right? He wanted to know more about English in France? No, I. .. - What? It is difficult to explain it. There was a guy who offered me work in France. I knew him. His wife was in love with me. - Why do you think so? Twice she took me shopping for clothes. No need for clothes. She bought them to compensate me. Does your spa with her husband and either? - No Well, once I did, but mostly it was able for some time. How long was there? Why do you want to know so much for me? Because I want to know if to confide in you or not. Look. I am one of those people against the government. And she told me about all this. We do not want to fight us. I am a good mother, I'm not bad. Want to know why why we die and forced. They seem to want everything. And this group of rich people began to steal land and to build on it. For hundreds over the years, they their returned legally rocky hills. She has not returned home a long time she loves her parents and has two small children. Her husband died at 20. My sister was never involved in politics. She was a nurse and worked hospital. She went to dances every Sunday and then she was walking with a boy who met the dance And then everything goes wrong, because Government was very interested by his brother but my sister never met his brother. But they said that f. So one day they came home and then beat, and they shall beat. Then it died. I thought I can not go. I thought, why not kill me. But no. So that left the children, with my parents I left town walking through mountains and found the rebels. I sat in a cafe the good part of town. Remembering what I saw and who hurt you. Is it possible to happen really. Back home, I went back normal life. But I can not detect how everything seemed different. Initially I tried To ignore this feeling manner and ignore some symptoms to heal. But they did not. I met Jeff several years ago, but I had not seen long ago. Talking about memories and places we visited, as a movie. Terrible things that we learned. I forgot to ask how deal father. Well, he ... I fear that When did it happen? I had to say earlier He went to therapy, but I think that it was angry. - Angry? Yeah, it was common story how bad to hospital I did not expect to be the best hospital in the world, but many pay enough money every day. The most incredible is that never I asked what this is about. And if you ask doctors, they they look like I told him one day, not asking to do predictions or to say a diagnosis, please treat me as a human being but I cry for five minutes in his office listen to my questions, because my father died. These were the words of a man who is not death occurred before He felt that was unfair that his father had to die. It is expected that you can not provide after-care for his father. Finally, at the very end there were six sisters, making it not to think about death. You know I think is so interesting there was six sisters who are tried to save dad or at least help him die without feeling any pain. And then At the other end of the world if people lie in bed like, without enough mass and can not be made by beds. And everything they can to die in a terrible agony incredible agony. My advice was to go somewhere where to sympathize with my friend. Sometimes I feel so good in a beautiful morning when her hair done. I went to buy tights Buy as many because it is not easy to find exactly what I like. I went to a birthday party with my neighbor. She told me about affair with an unknown man. the movie that upset her, actress, psychiatrist for criminals who walk around at night country with insatiable appetite for violence, sex. Unpredictable things put me in emotional state. Of 2000 km from here, a woman guard shoots two in robbery and now it will be executed. I could not stop thinking for this woman. What fits. I've always thought about happy person he loves life. What are you waiting for then time to go. I went to play with friends. 'And now watching it for so long with such tender affection. I watched her character, to retain its soul It is probably now living in apartment in Paris. Amanda's father wanted it to work for family the house where she grew up. My sister. My sister. My beloved, my precious, my joy. My life my needs, my happiness. Goodbye. - This person will not remain long alone. In return, she must live in an apartment. I could not remember ... why I should be negligible. You snooze? - No, no. - Doze, I'm generous. - No. It was amazing Do not you understand? - It was good. - Why worry? Because all these things rear their such a reaction to it. Maybe just what she wanted. - No, I can not hear it. What happens to me, I feel no longer believe in anything. All have their beliefs, everyone believes a particular thing. My neighbor believes in goods .- store make me feel guilty guilty of families in Africa which have nothing to eat. What should I do for families in Africa? Plane to catch and bring to Africans salad for lunch. And Fred, he also believes. - I love to drink champagne. Also the woman that I clean apartments, but the difference is I can not afford it. And now what you feel bad because of this? I'm sure if you change the locations it will feel the same for me. Mario believes that: People are selfish It is human nature. If I find money, I will spend them alone, rather than someone I have not seen before. Natasha believes that: I vote to bring money home trying to be a friend people who meet this is all I can do to make the world a better place. Life is not fair, some people have good moments others have bad moments, so it happens. Anne-Marie believes that: I have money in your wallet, because I earned this money, after much hard work. But honest people work hard. I'm not saying that is our fault do not we create rules, but have to ask Why work to bring more money home and they are practically nothing. Until you come christmas, and festive spirit conquered the streets and shops. The season makes me think for children and all people who have kids. Therefore, children are born worldwide. To be able to walk one day on the streets buying always best. Do you really need more children I will have more wealth for people in the world for all who already have, but not enough people already not need help and nothing at all. Of course, I'm one of them but who has decided to hurt. I do not want to think for all the things I know I like that. I know what I like. I like the heat convenience joy, love Gifts and good plays. But how come these items. Plays, Gifts What happens so that these things are not made for everyone. Of course only a few limited units in the world every day make limited pieces of things some things more than others .. Who tells them what to do. The power of money. They have money for things they want. They need money to have fraction of daily activity. And people who have little give little have much to give much and people who have nothing give nothing. And workers are subject the instructions of money. Money to say what is grown and on what sites to send, where children die of hunger. And telling others to sew costumes and repairing violins Every day is a great time before before opening the shop this moment of confusion. Money is silent, not even to talk, but determine health balance and strengthening. World can not make all for today If the food they provide for starving children does not deliver on time if the army fails to deliver security with food to children they will die. At the end I had a dream in which I was very young mother during Christmas. What happened? - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Just more I can not give gifts to anyone. I love you all. But I can not give you more gifts. I told my office that will taking another week off. I felt that maybe I should go back split in this cold country. Maybe it was the place where we had to go. If I die in this terrible This awkward .. Where it went. What's up with me, I feel I feel like nothing is left in me, I feel that I can not think of anything I do not believe in anything No, not stop it. Everyone believes in certain things. People in countries simply beautiful want to learn be in mental peace and silence. And it may be insensitive to rights ideology or to escape. Makers in the social plays and films may be more expressive, using humor. Artists including parts opera and ballet People can change separately and through them society. All must cooperate to people can help the trees solve the problems of the world helping all families are not important .. Rich and poor must live as friends and work together to make future better than the past. Today rebels tomorrow's dictators. Western democracy is form of government come from all others. But the question is what really matters if we have Fred, Robert and Bob who believe that democracy is Western form of government among others, and if Fred wakes and continues to believe in it. This is like believing Only his friend Bob, but what does that mean something that I can not even remember my beliefs. What is the thing I always say? Yes, that's exactly I like beauty. Country is very poor beautiful. Honest people are beautiful. Have a very amazing feeling in the country where most people are poor. To ride in a taxi to terrible places. Can be 10 times more beautiful may have more beautiful eyes. Appear sick, but those have adapted lighting no money in their pockets, they help each other. Why are not all that? Why not give it all you got? Answering this question. We simply live. I can not give more than I have. Wait a minute. I have faith That is why we can not give more of my money, the reason What I imply that I give them. In fact, I always gave gifts people from whom I have been interested. There should be no reason put money first not because I follow some time. I work for the money, I work hard for the money. I earn money and therefore they have and I can spend them on whatever I want. This is a way of life so I can stay in this hotel I am paid with money. And because I can stand here, I can be served I expect certain things be made. For example morning maid left my room in disarray. What is it, I do not clean sheets. I paid to stay here, I paid to be served and expected services. But I'm not the maid serve as needed. Which is wrong. Should I feel bad the woman has no money. There you have work? Certainly there is work where do your job well. Probably works 16 hours a day, field in the factory. It works Chambermaid work. You say that making money. What a wonderful expression. How can do so so much for so little time. When we have so some time. Now that I see in imprisonment with a strict regime. God left my book. And she looks very familiar. The book has never I read. The book has never I wanted to read. In what country I grew up, in any city on any street. My real parents color of their skin. Who have made money, what I felt, what I said. Yes, I understand that See replies my difficult questions. Why your job brings you so much money until their work is not offers them virtually nothing. Can not provide from the knowledge of where I born, how I grew up What hours of my life could be worse. Even if you know me inside my life has always been as history who so neprosledima and unexpected. I was born on field they provide Peace on earth with rich fruit he had there. The nights were very pleasant more than a maid. They were so energetic. This is your land, your piece of land. Which was black, aside and cracked. But here they are isolated in this torn box that gave me. Why did not they gave me one of the other. And no one was black and cracked. It happened because before I was born there were times of feudal lords, where we killed, early work season of field and ripped them together through the ages, night after night. glitter of knives cut meat, again and again. Until we meet Beautiful Christmas. and our proud parents We have shown impressive shining fields of blood. Where were our hours treatment, they said. Then he gave the children of next hill, the next valley. Drive fast will tell you everything. Others will give you what you want, and I'll give it at any price. Fear not leave their choice to being unfortunate. So we had everything but it was complicated. Curse from which we can not escape. We need wretches, even if we do not get noticed. Spend your life doing what they do and others dig in mines, work in factories. If only one wretch, if we pay well. You can dress nice and to walk in good restaurants. even eat ice fish. But we remember the manner in which abducted sisters of our land. Les Miserables and remember him too. They still do not accept that we have our land. They think that we should change it. So we need to talk to Les Miserables To talk and explain that This is not an option. They want things to be different want to change them. And we must say 'yes', we also want this change. Change is good, but no violent change without murder. or want revenge, no. Instead, listen to our idea for progressive change. The change will help will not hurt us. Morality, legality, progressive change. We planned everything a bilateral agreement We give you things, many things but change must be considered you are not entitled to take whatever you want. You know what offer is: First. We offer much more everything and then to convince everyone that must use the new stuff. This is reality. Now must wait Otherwise we give you more now. new things before leaving themselves. This I think we can lose. Problem is that we know Les Miserables We know that they can not wait for that panic, to prevent it. Violence has increased in all. Teaching people that these things God gives them. World can not benefit from it. So need to introduce special additional training for the poor wretches. to teach them the terrible Lessons from the past. All these crimes caused by terrorists and rebels. To teach people that they should never to try to see the power of the masses rules because of the crowd not always competent and are always cruel. The crowd is bloodthirsty. Rejected, they have no skills because it should never to happen .. They must understand that dreamer idealists, those who say that love Les Miserables. Always lead us to mass murder at the end Once you do something better, no doubt you always doing something worse. Promise to learn this lesson. The head of the secret and even they do not understand. Brought them all out and shot. People are attacked by soldiers from police they had to die. Killings continued long some of them sisters and brothers, already been killed, perhaps compassion or rage but they do not feel so. To control these people, we must be as fathers. To tell them how to speak, how to look. Sons to watch torture their parents and see how soldiers raped their children, This is how to control people who are not afraid of death. And now I teach people that, will get things but we will decide how you give and when. Because we do not believe you give everything. This can not be me. This is impossible. My life was so beautiful. Everything was fine for me. No. No, this is wrong. Omitted to prevent it. The old woman baking which You gave muffins, do you loved not love as you think. Trying to explain that People hate and try to explain why they hate people. Why do you think they love. What used to love. Who are you. Look a little. Walk so stiffly each morning to the kitchen. Stand beside cabinet open it and doing coffee which they expect to rouse. It must be there and if one morning not so. And very crucial and unexpected and do not expect that evidence pulling all too panic breathing heavily. Oh, where are you? Around the world have to pay. Listening to the sound of his voice on the phone, while talking about his life. Oh no. Robin, Robin Robin. What do I need to go. What do I need to go .. Most likely you need permission to go. Understand their position. No place to live no clothes to wear, free. You will be like them. Homeless, restless Of course, you know I will do everything without limits. Sometimes I think about suffering of the poor wretches. Get in bed, feel like them speak words of hope. As new drugs are for your children. Soon the house. Cold world, cold people as my neighbors will soon realize constructive change will happen. But the spirit of the jury waiting and waiting for a constructive change one by one they come to knock on your door Crying, they asked for help. New story on how to get from one to give to others. And to escape away from us bad neighborhoods of infection from hell. Some of them are angry, other mad. and crimes which do fill each with great terror. Some of them punished, in some countries, some of them execute them. Someday I can control, to punish, to execute just you. Justice is so for you because as much as you like these snow-white linen music and dancers Because all the people who excited people will be tortured tonight who will be killed tonight. See? not fanaticism is so extreme no matter what evidence there is, you need to see each person. Your life is an example of how one takes something from someone else. These people always want to take something. And these people can not be able to understand things. This misunderstanding of the situation is the lifestyles of all people. So to say that you understand problem of how the world works and the base is not unfair. Because you have to share things you need how inappropriate it is to share things who have shared with you And all people like you who need to share everything they have. This means that it is not inappropriate. And others that have to share the remnants. The way the world works base is not unfair. You should find this Top highest quality of this Man. While the young woman met in the church falls into a desperate situation because people who lost. Employee who is it tortured with a knife. You must define it as the lowest and very exceptionable example. who deserve punishment by death. Dear God, I understand What I This will be continually outwit. I lie for many things, many bad moments. I wonder if I can not let your bird to live free lives. Go, try, let it happen. Say it, say it. Life you lead is hopelessly corrupted. It is not just effective My sympathy to the people does not change people's lives. Constructive change has not happened. People's lives is increasingly worse. I am not better than baker or chambermaid. So do not deserve more of what they have. It is not an inevitable fate for me have more. Money which have been part of me. I completely and easily separates them. Keeping the money was simple choice I made. I tried to split things with me but they were always against the others. I was alone against the crowd and perspective of one of crowd I'm the same. as my relatives I'm exactly the same. And I'm not covered, I could not do 2 choices I could change their attitudes, I could join their understanding. Transmitted by loved ones, working in danger very difficult. Choices if I could not accept this fraudulent to accept this comfort. Why not? Suffering close and evil. Fever broke. I see the stone. Wondering what it is happened last night may be a night in which prisoners killed or executed. Hours pass. others make them in the hallway out of their tombs. Streets awake, but I do not sleep. Next week I'll be home. You will sleep in his room, surrounded by my personal stuff my lamp, clock books, gifts porcelain ballerina, undisturbed. Let all those persons to sit on my bed.
