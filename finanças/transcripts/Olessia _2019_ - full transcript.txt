- Olissia (Piano playing) Can't you stop it at least now? It's been many years since we started to hear and listen this. Oh! My God.! Breakfast is ready. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, Will sing lullaby On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. You became a companion and support as my dream. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. Unni. My only Unnikannan. The pain of my forever trembling mind On the shoulders of a little dream, resting every day listening to my lullaby Mine Unni. (Kisses.) Only for you, blooming in my memory Trembles mind's pain Only for you, blooming in my memory, trembling mind's pain You're alone in my dreams. In reality, I'm alone. You're alone in my dreams. In my reality, I'm alone. Let's have a swing. Will you come. I'll turn out to be a lullaby in music. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. Quivering heart's rhythm In departing memories Scattering Rose pot. I'm alone in darkness. Tears alone. I'm alone in darkness. Tears alone. Will you ever come along to a dreamy nestle. Gift you a kiss, will you be mine? On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. You became a companion and support as my dream. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. Oleessia - Oleessia - Yes dear. What is it? - Uncle, is there Oleessia? - Yes, she's inside. Every one is on leave today. Shall we go for an outing? - No What is it dear? My sadness is my happiness. And, it's much in this room. I don't like an outing for enjoyment, Jessica. Oleessia Like you, if life is just a pain of the past like... None can really come out. Just forget the past. Life of the present Oleessia, please... Come dear, please. No tension. Excuse me sir. Yes, come in. (Phone ringing) Let her die. It is good for everyone Okay. Alright. Olissia. Schizophrenia The children born here, 30 out of 100, are mad. Among them, some will be the society through Art and literature. In some others, It'll grow as a greed for money. Without looking for a way to the destiny, they'll wait like wolves. And, still some others, will hand over their life to the madness and find content in it. Good. Everything is for good. One of my patients Passed away. That's correct. No money. No treatment for those who who have no money. That's the adage of the modernity. Today's medical industry is a constant battle between money and fate. Olissia, you, yourself, are the reason behind your illness. In your mind's shade of love, the emotion of Unni that's well nurtured by you, has already grown as a poisonous tree. It's roots even will get strengthened from your tombstone. Olissia, cut off those poisonous roots from your mind. Such Unni hasn't ever born, nor died. He has no place in this world. Nor in your mind. Stop it. No. No. Please doctor. hey... She's as if she's dead. No use of being alive. Doctor... In the time of playful age, she became a loving mother. So, old-age creeped in to her youth. What I was telling, she can't be a mother. Maybe, if she becomes a mother there won't be any love in her for that child. - Please doctor. - For, her mind is already dead. - Don't say like that Tell. To hack, right? Will make it empty, no matter what international account. My commission is 30 percentage. Who are you? Grandson of Francis. Suddenly, I couln't recognise you, Philix. You're all grown-up. Your father and mother? They came back with me from France. - Olissia? -Yea, come in son. Hi Olissia. You still does that great piano playing, right? Everything has changed here completely. Eight years of France life together, she also bored of me. I am also like you. Alone. Who told you, you're alone? In this lonely journey, there's only one thing to remember i.e. our childhood. In fact, we both are in the same life-streaming, right Olissia? Maybe, that's what God likes. - Ah! Look, he's here! - Olissia? - Olissia has a guest today. Phelix. An old friend. Come dear. Can't it be changed one day, Olissia? - Danny uncle has told. Phelix, right? -Yes. - You were buddy friends, right? - Anyways, Olissia didn't ever tell of this great friend of hers. - Oh The rest of the talk can be, having this. So, there's no change even in Jessica's presence. I've been waiting, still knowing, won't be come back. That's gone away from my love I've been waiting for something. Weaving a thousand dreams in mind You're near dangling in a disappearing gentle wind In returning memory's moonlight Will a memory's shadow fill me as a breeze Weaving a thousand dreams in mind In weeping nights, your deparated memories Whom you came searching? being dear memories will you embrace me with your dear hands? Will you be onto my chest for a lullaby? will you embrace me with your dear hands? Will you be onto my chest for a lullaby? Will you blossom as love on the Malar petals? Will you be a moonlight for the sight? In the memories you shared The pain is being cured. The expected fondness by you in separated night May I come along with you in the cradle of time? May you be mine healing heart's ache? May I come along with you in the cradle of time? May I come along with you in the cradle of time? Will you be flowers on to the unlit heart? Will you rest on my chest healing the weeps of my mind? Weaving a thousand dreams in mind You're near dangling in a disappearing gentle wind In returning memory's moonlight, Will a memory's shadow fill me as a breeze Weaving a thousand dreams in mind No Phelix Not like that. Olissia's birthday is today. Me and Danny uncle are celebrating. Anyhow, this world is not like what I've known. Parent. Hmm. My parents, they came back from France, only to get rid of me. Grand Father was the only console in my loney life from the childhood. I realised the value of that great love when I lost it. Whatever we've seen once may not be seen again. May not be found out as well. Wth us will be something that we've never seen. In all my uncelebrated happiness, The absence of dear ones, What stood as a consolation was memories. For Olissa, at least Jessica is there. The world is not that hopeless, Philix. There's a world of hope, and love in waiting Philix. Everything will be fulfilled if we pray to Holy Mary. The lost happiness and the separated love, everything will be. I too will pray for Philix. Please Philix, let's pray and leave. Please come Philix. The rhythm of quivering heart In the departed memories Scattering rose pot Became alone in darkness Being tears alone Became alone in darkness Being tears alone On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? - Hi Ashlin - Dear Ashlin Smile dear. Hey, honey. Shall we go? Take care dear. Sister is really tired. Shall we play piano? Is it just enough playing along with Ashlin? - What about your home work? - Mom Just one more round with Ashlin, then I'll do the home work. Please? Please mom? - Hmm? - one more round? If not his sister, who'll play with Ashlyn? Son. Honey. Need to return to Berlin vey soon. Ash? We can't take him. For, you're not just mother and wife there. But, my business partner and also my secretary. We could take Olissia for one year. Then, the situation was different. But, now... Olissia and Danny are there to take care of him. We can appoint a lady servant as well if it is necessary. It is not that we don't love her... Sherly, It's because we've more love and care Olissia stayed with us only one year. But, I've earned the Dollars by which she can live like a princess even a thousand years. Now, our earnings for Ashlyn. Today, even if we leave him as an orphan, He won't be as such, one day. And, by all means, he'll speak of us proudly... Ticket is confirmed and we'll go on 25th. (Church bell chimes) I proclaim it aloud: "By the thrown away coins, and the burning candles whoever comes to buy God by weighing. Woe to you! The laughs of the voiceless are sobs of their sorrows. Let them hear who have ears." I tell standing on the stairs of constant sorrow The trees of goodness have withered away. The nests on the branches have fallen down. Still, the divine doves will nestle in that bleak darkness. - Olissia - Hmm? At least, you're coming to this deserted church. Don't waste your sadness. Learn to enjoy it. The heavenly Father who has accounts even of your hairs may bless you so abundantly. Okay, daddy. Olissia Take care of Ashlyn very well. - Mom will call you by reaching there. hmm? - Bye dear. - Don't be sad, hmm? Bye, Danny uncle. Oh son, don't cry dear. Why do you cry? They'll come now. Don't cry dear. - Is this your little brother? - hmm When he's able to speak, what he'll call you? Kunjechy (little sister) No. But, mother. Mother. Unny's alone mother. Where were you all this time? I was at church. I've told you several times not to go that Kari Kurissu Church. And, still you go there, hmm? I'll inform your daddy today itself. Even you took that small child to him. - Olissia - hmm? The prayers of that old man is not holy. It's black magic. He thinks of destruction. Not of goodness. - Please uncle. Please. - Hmm - Uncle, please forgive for this time. - Shut up. Your tongue, I'll... Hmm go. Go, go. At least do have this soup. - Didn't you hear me? - No. How do you hear?

There are only three days left. - What for? For my Ash's birthday. Daddy and Mummy will reach, and then us too. Like a prince, I'l dress my Unni.l - Then, here it is a great celebration! - Ha ha In the moonlight Aren't you there as a rose? Aren't you there in the serene skies of twinkling stars? Blossomed in moonlight, Shedding honey Come dancing near mother. Shall share you the love of a throbbing heart. Unni come near me. Aren't you there as a rose in the moonlight?

Don't you cry little darling Am I not there as a Thumba Flower Aren't you there in the serene skies of twinkling stars? (Trying to imitate sounds) Did you learn honey? (Trying to teach him music notes) Did you learn? Please tell honey. - Ash - Huh Tell Let Mom tell? - Upset? - No - What it would have been, if I didn't teach you this? Come. Come. Come. Smile dear.

When Ashlyn grew up, daddy will take you both to Germany. When all you come together, it'll be very happy everyday. Let it go of today. Hope, my grand-father won't kill me before that. Olissia, daddy has just called you. Told, don't reduce celebrations as they don't come. Come, let's have dinner. I am not hungry now. - You are also not hungry? - No. Go and have dinner. (Sighs) Anyways, the birthday party was really grant. Nice food. - Being glutton, you'll make me to run to the doctor tonight. - Shut up I've parceled some food for the night. From that, you don't expect not even a little. I don't need it. Perfect day to parcel it. - They are all tensed since Daddy didn't come. - Ha ha Fools! Whoever has gone from here, didn't come back. With the sacks of money, they'll come once. But, then, the journey will be in like-this wheelchairs and mobile ICUs . Ha ha ha Ha ha ha Ashlyin dear. My little darling. Honey. Ah, give him.

Why couldn't you come back in that school bus? It's been a while your hurryness. - Hope no problem for Ashlyn. - A lot of problems; Not for Ashlyn, but for you. Honey Unni dear If you put on weight, it'll be tough for me. Don't burst those balloons sitting on my shoulders. - Will you burst it? - No. It is to hang on our Christmas tree. This whole world will celebrate Unni's Birthday. Do you know why? You little idiot. The birthday of you and Jesus is on the same day. Do you know, who are coming to celebrate this year's Christmas and Unni's birthday? Dad and mom. Then, we go to Germany along with dad and mom. Did you hear? Come. There it is. - Is there Pappa with you? - He is, definitely. (Speaking in Hindi language) Come. Come. Sherly, please. - Hi Ashlyn - Dear. - Hello - Every one is on the other side. Come dear. Didn't Appu come? Do dance well, you all. - Grandpa, control your food. - Get lost. My Unni. - Mother... - Huh - What happened!? (Inaudible conversations) Son... Ashlyn Dear... Olissia. Olissia. Dear... Dear... Dear Olissia Open your eyes, dear. Only for you, blooming in my memory Trembles mind's pain You're alone in my dreams. In reality, I'm alone. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. John, please take at least these medicines. I don't want. Why uncle like this? Take that medicine. - What for? - To get well. Then? Then, for what? I don't need this to postpone death. Don't say like that. When we gain one thing, lose another. Take as such. Earned a lot. But, what's the point. Life is like a mirror. Many things will appear and disappear. But, nothing will be there as constant. We came here giving Unni to Olissia when he was 6 month old. She was sister to him, mother to him And everything to him. When we came for Unni's third birthday, what we gifted her... Unni's dead- body. Olissia hates even to see us. Robert, you should go to India for us. And fr our daughter. You can, to give back my old Olissia. Losing existence, when I die here in Germany, At least to give a kiss, Olissia should be here among us. - Why haven't you attended the calls for the past few days? - Nothing. -Robert will come there. - Why? - He comes there for a geological.thesis .. We should provide accomodation in our home. Why can't you arrange it somewhere else? Dear, Robert is a very important person to us. There's no one important to me. I don't like, he's coming here. (Phone ringing) Ah, come. Come. - This is your room, Robert. - Mm-hmm - Freshen up - Okay. - I'll get you tea. - Okay uncle. (Sounds of waves from the backwaters) What do you want? Don't ask anyone, what do they want? Huh, what if I asked for the moon..? How will I explain... Hmm, have this tea. Don't find comfort in keep disturbing him. I brought this tea for Olissia. Please. Hmm Did aunty speak of me? Aunty not, Mother. Daddy and mummy, they were waiting to see Olissia. When are you going to Germany, Olissia? I don't know. - When will your reach complete? - I too don't kno. I know, this room is Olissia's world. If you're fine pleoday.ase join us for the prayer today. God does like so much the communion of love. Our prayer is not for us; but for those who separate from us. Once he'will come from the heavens. To see us all. (Whispering prayers) Became a little late. - Did Jessica know? - Hmm? A local guardian has come for Olissia from Germany. You got tensed? Never. She's just a friend. There's only one person in my mind. - Are you more frequent to it? - No, just occassionally. Without these, we too will become like Olissia It's good. Occassionally, a comfort to our body and for mind as well. When will you go to France? You'll be with me when I'll go. Do I have to live for Daddy and mummy, who have come here just to get rid of me. Or, do I have to live for you? (Singing in non-malayalm language) We'll search for love and run for desires. This game of life is in speed We'll change for times and search for roles. This game of life is in speed. (Singing in non-malayalm language) In the smiles of day Weakening mind In the covering of night crying simply We'll search for love. We'll search for love and run for desires. This game of life is in speed. We'll change for times and search for roles. This game of life is in speed. We'll change for times and search for roles. This game of life is in speed. I'll give it today. Olissia Olissia Olissia, food is ready. If all withdrew to each rooms, this home will end up as of the heartless. Your Unni is living in every one's heart as a Rose. Not having? Unni will be seeing us. Instead of our bouquet a thousand bouquet that he gives back; Olissia is not seeing it. Can't you see it, Olissia? I can. Let's us go receiving it in our hearts. Come. Every one hates the blessings by these weak hands. Yet, if anything is left in me let it be for you. I tell in sadness, If you're still hunt by Unni's death, your fate will be for being a prey to it. I saved only these candles to light it when I die. So, none likes me to die. I'll die in suffering. Ha ha ha I really didn't like hat that father told. These friendships made you like this. From her childhood, I advise her, not to meet him. But, Olissia needs only his prayers. Father tells only truth. I believe it. Who did wish Unni to die? Did you? And, did your Danny uncle? Without the peace of mind, In germany, living in just expecting you your dad and mom wished for it? How is it Philix? Nothing yet. Everything will be fine in two days. It's foolish to be late. It shouldn't ever happen to a hacker, okay? Going to have crores and much prosperity. I need to operate it with someone else if not Philix. - Our target is not such documents that we can ask directly. - Hmm, no. It's possible to cheat only once and it takes time. On the disappearing paths, paths... Blooming memories, memories... Shall share my pain, pain Shower your love Separated unknowingly, Filled in dreams, Shed petals without blossoming Shattered in darkness, Tear-filled eyes, Unfaded nights... Will time dissipate my unending sadness? Will it echo in the ears, the ever-needed loving chatters? Will you come as my childhood to listen to my story? Please return in my memory to listen to my voice. Would love fade away in this never-ending journey? My life disappears as the sobs of nights Will you come close as time to listen to the voice of separation? Will you come as my tomorrows to see my eyes that filled in dreams? As my tomorrows. - Olissia - Where were you all this time? I've been here itself, close to you. Freshen up. Let's go for a trip. Where? Anywhere. How long it's been since we spend time together. - What do you want? - Nothing. What is it, huh? - What do you really search here? No, searched nothing. Don't come this house in the name of old relationship. Robert, what are you telling? This is my Jessica. She's killing you by smiling. You can't understand it all. Didn't I say it? Your friendship made you as such. Don't be a fool again. - Hello Jessic. Hello. - Dear - Hello - I'm Jessica's father, dear. - Uncle - Did she tell anything to you yesterday? - No. - Didn't tell anything to me. - Why did she do as such, then? We lost her dear. We lost her. (Trying to call again) (Receiving switched-off message) Olissia, come. Today's breakfast is my special. You... You killed my Jessica. You, you alone. Why did you come to this room? Credits card, the key to the treasure box. What for? Can't you give it? I don't need anything. Every one is leaving me. My Unni. My Jessica. You can also go. Don't come this home in the name of any relation. The day I remember your face unknowingly Bloomed silence in mind. The day I remember your face unknowingly, bloomed silence in mind. Night memories that stood disappeared. will it separate now? To await you ever, To await you ever, You didn't utter anything. You didn't utter anything. The day I remember your face unknowingly, bloomed silence in mind. The day I met you first time, I waited you alone. The day I met you first time, I waited you alone. To be one for at least once. To be one for at least once. Will you come with me as my companion? I shall wait. The day I remember your face unknowingly, bloomed silence in mind. The night memories that stood disappeared. will it separate now? (Utter a strong cry) I came alone, You're being love on my way. I came alone, You're being love on my way. To be hand-in-hand throughout this journey. To be hand-in-hand throughout this journey. Don't separate in this life. Don't shed... The day I remember your face unknowingly, bloomed silence in mind. The night memories that stood disappeared. will it separate now? (Playing piano) Olissia Will come. Can't be otherwise. Do you know, a baby is not just growing in mother's womb... In a father's mind too. It grows as bigger hope and dreams... I can understand a woman. I can understand a mother's pain. The happiness when we receive and the pain when we lose it... There won't be anyone who knows it better than me. I've been living in great agony when I lost Unni and when I felt, I was losing my daughter too. But, I didn't see it outside. The modern world women are as such, it seems. I can't take it any longer. I am just a woman... just a mother. - John, Olissia is pregnant; and do you know its father? - Hmm Robert. Why did Robert go to germany leaving my daughter alone in this conditin? See, he'll come. Let's call him. Home, it was a cemetry for me till now. But, now I feel very happy. Here also, we're going to have a baby; A grandchild for us. I didn't expect it as such. Nothing happened in our life as we've expected. Everything is God's willing. We need to tell everything calling Robert. But, Olissia... She... Hmm... I don't know, what's in her mind. - Dear - Olissia - Olissia Oh God, save my child. Son... Hi dear. Olissia, Robert will come now. Father of your child. I have only my Unni None else, I've. Oh, what dear. Son. Don't cry dear. Olissia, can you forget me? I promised your mom to bring back you to their life. I brought you back not to their life alone, but to my life as well. I'm your Robert, only your's. Dear Olissia, it is our child. Instead of our departed Unni, Another Unni to us, gifted by God. Olissia Don't we want to bring up him so dearly? Don't we have to sing him lullabies? Our Unni. Our Unni alone. Unni. Son. Dear. Don't we have to take him on shoulders? Don't we have to take him Kurishumala (A pilgrimage centre) Along with Unni, along with all Without any sadness, without any pain to carry Don't we have to celebrate a lot of Christmas? In this journey, you might be meeting an Ashlyn like this anywhere. This is a reminder: love is to express, not to save. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby. You became a companion and support as my dream. On the shoulders of a little dream, Will you please rest? On the body of a little star, I will sing lullaby.
