Girls who aren't intelligent bore the pants off me, mentally. I like girls to be attractive, of course, and independent! Girls who can think for themselves! I'm not intellectual, but I hope I'm fairly intelligent. My main interests are sun... ..skiing, water skiing, games in general. I used to have an aeroplane and I'm quite keen on cars, I have a Lancia. I like cars to be attractive... ...well-built and quite fast. I'm definitely not class-conscious. The people who interest me are amusing, creative people. I don't read much or go to the theatre or opera or ballet. What I can't bear are people with chips on their shoulders. I have working-class friends to speak and laugh with, but they never come to stay. I just don't think it would work. Of course, there are always bound to be class distinctions, but these break down as soon as people who haven't had money before acquire it. I don't see why country estates shouldn't go on as they are, provided they're well run and the tenants are happy and have a better deal than they would if they were independent. Why people get excited by money and a title I can't think! All it can buy you is a good table at a restaurant. In 'ere, quick! I'll write. Fare thee well, my only love. Fare thee well awhile. ♪ And I will come again to thee ♪ Though it were ten thousand miles ♪ What's to become of the World Cup? We'll not have it. This afternoon was a moment of truth for English football. 'Ere! How much longer can we go on like this? We're a laughing stock! The game's been taken over by foreigners. Foreigners, mind you, we were fighting against in the last war! It's a national humiliation. - Who? Who invented the game? - We did! And this afternoon, our lot played like they had two left feet. It was shocking! They don't care, do they? Come on, then. Go on, shift yourself! Can I put your coat up? Hey! Where's that smoked Irishman, then? How much am I going to take off you tonight, then? Are you going all the way, then? - Hey, you want to watch him, love. - Have a drink. - Brew it yourself, did you? - No, he nicked it. He only assisted in the nicking thereof.

Our speed is approximately 25 miles per hour and visibility is moderate. All right? Welcome aboard this "See Your City" bus. We hope your journey will be a happy one. You can follow the route taken by the map provided, and we will be visiting places old and new, and places of our past and present, and places of our heritage. Most important of all, you will be able, we hope, to meet the people of this city, who are noted for their warmth and friendliness. I'm glad to see a youngster turning out today. I know you don't all spend your lives singing and dancing and... listening to records. Are you all right, now? Are you sure? OK, thank you. These walky-talky sets are provided for the convenience of visitors during our tour. By raising the antenna so... Right. Press in the button marked "on". Then placing against the ear you will be able to hear clearly detailed information during and throughout at all stages of our tour. Thank you. - Everybody switched on? - Yes. All right? Thank you. Your Worship. Will you all follow me, please? This way. You are now in one of the biggest industrial estates in the country. No fewer than 84 different industries are featured here, making a total of 136 companies. These provide employment for over 875,000 operatives. I was born in this city, and proud of it. I'm a plain man - Blunt by name and blunt by nature! As a boy, I played bare-footed in these streets and today, today I'm worth three-quarters of a million pounds! Do you mind not feeling my leg, please? Money is the root of all progress. The Industrial Revolution created great social problems, as well as bringing economic advances, as you very well know. This city of ours is deeply stained with the rust of industry, but times are changing dramatically. Science has liberated the worker and given him more leisure, but he needs to be educated for that leisure. Oh, yes, indeed. We are justifiably proud of the steps that we are taking to help solve this problem. I'm very glad you could get along today. This must be very interesting for you, coming as you do from an ancient culture, where the hand plough and the ox cart work alongside the helicopter and the tractor. This place had been allowed to get very run-down before the council took it over. Yes. Very run-down. ♪ In Erwägung unserer Schwäche machtet ihr ♪ Gesetze, die uns knechten soll'n ♪ Die Gesetze seien künftig nicht beachtet ♪ In Erwägung, dass wir nicht mehr Knecht sein woll'n ♪ In Erwägung, dass ihr uns dann eben ♪ Mit Gewehren und Kanonen droht ♪ Haben wir beschlossen, nunmehr schlechtes Leben ♪ Mehr zu fürchten als den Tod ♪ In Erwägung, dass wir hungrig bleiben ♪ Wenn wir dulden, dass ihr uns bestehlt... ♪ There's never been an age like the one we're living in, and it is absolutely essential, we feel, to establish some sort of community centre, affording opportunities for corporate relaxation and refreshment. ♪... dass ihr uns dann eben... ♪ Aagh! ..part of the latest slum-clearing scheme. This estate has rehoused many thousands of citizens, and we are particularly proud of this as representing our most distinguished achievement so far. In the rehousing of citizens whose previous dwellings have been situated in less salubrious neighbourhoods, often built without consideration to their surrounding industries. Flat-dwelling has not been popular up till now, but we are gradually breaking down this resistance by showing how pleasant it can be to live in flats if they are well-planned and situated in pleasant surroundings. Watch out for the gasworks coming up on the right. It isn't generally realised that this was one of the first cities in the world to provide gas for the public at a purely nominal rate. Ladies and gentlemen, you will notice we are now leaving the built-up areas and entering more open country. Many of our more prominent citizens live in this area, which is well-known for its spacious residences and fine gardens. The large park we are now entering is Queen's Oak Park, a very popular place of recreation in all seasons and with all sections of the community. Parker. I, er... I can promise you an exceptional display of gladioli during the next two weeks, Your Worship. Well, at least we can feel pleased with ourselves when our brown shoes wear a polished mahogany smile! - Carry on, Parker. - Your Worship. He's seen over... he's seen over 50 years' service with us. Wounded three times at Mons. Armington Hall was donated to the city by the Armington family. It was originally built in mediaeval style by the late Joshua Armington, one of the greatest of our 19th-century industrialists. Yes. The Industrial Revolution made Armington a very wealthy man, of course. He combined great business acumen with real Christianity. In the old days, this used to be a mecca for English society. "God forgive me", he had inscribed on his tomb. The hall is now a school for girls with a very fine high academic record. With its special emphasis on community ties the Hall has taken its place as an integral part of the life of the community, but this is not all. A modern building scheme is in stages of planning. The curriculum of the school has been made highly selective, specially designed to prepare the girls to play their essential role in the world of tomorrow. ♪ Let us now praise famous men ♪ And our fathers that begat us ♪ Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms ♪ Men renowned for their power ♪ Leaders of the people by their counsels and by their knowledge ♪ Such as found out musical tunes ♪ And recited verses in writing ♪ All these were honoured in their generations ♪ And were the glory of their times ♪ We are extremely proud - and we think justifiably proud - of our central library, art gallery and museum.

You've got some disgusting books in here. I borrowed one recently written by a former Member of Parliament who'd been in prison for many years on account of his unorthodox business practices. In this book, he mentions a clergyman who was sentenced to ten years for perversion. I've no great sympathy for the clergyman, but after borrowing other books from public libraries in this city, I began to think that this sentence was hard. Most of the books, which I selected at random, were mere tracts condoning homosexual practices disguised as literature. I won't disclose the titles, for obvious reasons. One author, in my opinion, after going into his background, is a man who, sooner or later, will come into collision with the authorities. Meantime, he's free to write filthy books and have them published at a profit. Everything he writes is acclaimed by the critics. This author maintains that public revulsion at perversion is middle-class prejudice. It's most alarming. I'm beginning to wonder how many more dirty books there are in our public libraries. Shall we have a cup of tea? The tribe has a strong sense of unity based upon the tradition of a common descent from a single male ancestor, but there's no political unity. The shattering social change was introduced through an edict forbidding exchange marriage. This, more than anything else, gave the younger generation the opportunity and the ability to question traditional ways, the authority of the elders and, in general, the very foundations of the tribal culture. But more urgently, we live in a world haunted by the destructive powers that we have released. It is essential that we have faith in a world-risen belief in the future of human living. ..upon our ability to hope depends our willingness to act in the present, now, immediately, upon the instant. You think about the question, how can technical change be introduced with such regard for established culture patterns that human values are preserved within the technological and social structure of the future. Excuse me, Your Worship. It's time we were leaving. Oh, is it? Yes, right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now taking the lift to the city museum. - This way, please. - Please return your cups and saucers! - Does this thing work? - No, sir. Oh.
