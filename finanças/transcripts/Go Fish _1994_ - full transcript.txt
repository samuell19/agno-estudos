[Kia] MAKE A LIST OF WOMEN THAT YOU THINK ARE LESBIANS OR THAT YOU KNOW ARE LESBIANS THROUGH HISTORY OR PRESENT TIME. EVE. [Woman] EVE WHO? [Laughter] SAPPHO. [Man] HANNAH HOCH. WHO'S HANNAH HOCH? LILY TOMLIN. [Kia] LILY TOMLIN. OKAY. WHO ELSE? [Woman] DENNIS THE MENACE'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR MARGARET. WHITNEY HOUSTON. KRISTY McNICHOL? MORGAN FAIRCHILD. ANGELA DAVIS. MARY LOU RETTON. MARY LOU RETTON? VIRGINIA WOOLF. MARILYN QUAYLE. OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN. CHELSEA CLINTON. [Woman] SHE IS! WHAT ABOUT PEPPERMINT PATTY? ENDORA FROM BEWITCHED? AGNES MOOREHEAD. AGNES MOOREHEAD? THE ENTIRE CAST OF ROSEANNE. HA HA HA! EXCEPT FOR DAN, RIGHT? EXCUSE ME. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY ARE WE EVEN MAKING THIS LIST? IT'S COMPLETELY SPECULATION. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. THROUGHOUT LESBIAN HISTORY, THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT WILL TELL US WHAT THESE WOMEN'S LIVES WERE TRULY ABOUT. LESBIAN LIVES AND LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS BARELY EXIST ON PAPER. IT'S WITH THAT IN MIND AND UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING AND POWER OF HISTORY... THAT WE BEGIN TO WANT TO CHANGE HISTORY. [Max] I FEAR THAT THE MOMENT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET WILL BE THWARTED. MAYBE IT ALREADY HAS BEEN. I THINK I SAW HER ON THE SUBWAY YESTERDAY. I THOUGHT, "WE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET ON THE BUS." SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO SIT NEXT TO ME, SPILL HER SODA ON ME. WE'D MAKE A GAME OF CLEANING UP, TOUCH EACH OTHER MORE THAN NECESSARY, GET OFF AT THE SAME STOP, TALK. SHE SAYS, "WELL?" LIKE SHE FEELS DUMB BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING LIKE OLD FRIENDS. I REALIZE HOW EXCELLENT SHE IS IN EVERY WAY. WE KISS IN THE STREET. WE TALK ABOUT IT FOR YEARS LATER-- HOW WE NEVER BELIEVED IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT UNTIL WE MET. INSTEAD, SOME FAT MAN GOT IN THE WAY. SHE WAS RUSHING FOR THE BUS. HE WADDLED AHEAD, SPILLING THE DRINK SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO SPILL IN MY LAP ON HIS INDIFFERENT SHOULDER. SHE MISSED THE BUS WITH ME ON IT, AN EMPTY SEAT NEXT TO ME, OBLIVIOUS, THINKING ABOUT THE TEXTURE OF RAISINS AND SCRAPING AT GUM STUCK TO THE SEAT IN FRONT. I'M SURE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. THE WHOLE FIASCO PROBABLY THREW US BOTH OUT OF WHACK. OUR PATHS WON'T CROSS UNTIL YEARS LATER WHEN SHE'S FORGOTTEN SHE'S A DYKE. SHE'LL MOVE IN NEXT DOOR. I'LL HAVE A PAINFUL CRUSH ON HER. SHE'LL BE SITTING WITH HER BOYFRIEND, AND SHE'LL WAVE TO ME. I'LL GET A LILT IN MY STOMACH WHEN SHE WAVES, AND I'LL TRIP OVER MY CAT AND STUMBLE IN A 3 STOOGES WAY. SHE'LL LOOK AWAY LIKE SHE'S EMBARRASSED FOR ME. I'LL FEEL REALLY DUMB. THEN HER BOYFRIEND WILL THINK I SEEM LIKE I WOULD BE FUN. ONE MORNING, HE'LL INVITE ME TO A SHINDIG THEY'RE HAVING. COME ON. I'LL GO AND NOT KNOW ANYONE, SIT IN THE CORNER, PLAY WITH PISTACHIO SHELLS, AND GIVE EACH WOMAN A MENTAL MAKEOVER. "WHAT IF SHE WORE BAGGY JEANS?" "SHE'D BE REALLY HOT IF SHE CUT THAT PERM." THEN DREAM GIRL WILL INTRODUCE ME TO SOMEONE. SHE'LL SAY, "THIS IS MATT. SHE'S MY NEIGHBOR." I'LL SAY, "NO. ACTUALLY, IT'S MAX. "IT'S MAX, LIKE, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE." I'LL WALK HOME SAYING, "IT'S MAX. MY NAME IS MAX. "WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET ON THE BUS 2 YEARS AGO. "WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SITTING ON OUR COUCH, "READING AND PLAYING FOOTSIE ABSENT-MINDEDLY. "MY NAME IS MAX "I WANT TO BORROW YOUR T-SHIRTS, "WAKE YOU WHEN I HAVE BAD DREAMS, "SMILE WHEN WE'RE FIGHTING BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO ADORABLE, "PINCH YOUR BUTT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING IN FRONT OF ME. "MY NAME IS MAX. MAKE UP A NAME FOR ME, "SOMETHING YOU'D BE EMBARRASSED TO CALL ME IN PUBLIC. "FALL IN LOVE WITH ME. "WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET SO LONG AGO. "WE'RE WAY BEHIND. "IT'S MAX. MY NAME IS MAX." [Alarm buzzing] [Alarm stops] SHIT. [Kia] I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN CLASS 10 MINUTES AGO. WE'RE NOT THAT LATE. STOP IT. THIS IS WHY WE'RE IN TROUBLE ANYWAY. NO MORE SEX AFTER MIDNIGHT.

WE EXPECT QUEER FILMMAKERS TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK ANYONE. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE CAN WITHSTAND SUCH NEGATIVE REPRESENTATION FROM WITHIN OUR OWN RANKS. HE HATES HIMSELF FOR BEING GAY. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

SHE HAD A COMMITMENT TO WORK. I NEEDED TO STAY AND FINISH SCHOOL, AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FINISH SCHOOL. SHE HAS A REALLY GOOD JOB. WE JUST... KIND OF PARTED. THAT DATE WAS A BAD SCENE.

SHE'S MY FRIEND, TOO, BUT I KNOW A DEAD RELATIONSHIP WHEN I SEE ONE. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE STILL GOING OUT. IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW LESBIANS NEVER BREAK UP.

IT'S VERY SAD. YOU'RE STEERING THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM WHAT YOU DID TO ME. I THOUGHT AFTER YOU GOT PAST YOUR SHALLOW FASHION REQUIREMENTS, YOU'D FIND ELY INTERESTING. KIA, INTERESTING? LET ME GO OVER THINGS ABOUT HER THAT WORKED FOR ME-- DRESSES LIKE MY MAMMA IN THE '70s, HAD 100 DIFFERENT KINDS OF TEA--ALL DECAF, SHE LIKED THAT STUPID MOVIE, SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN HER OWN OPPRESSION, AND LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT, SHE'S MARRIED. TO KATE? YOU KNEW SHE HAD A GIRLFRIEND? I THOUGHT THEY BROKE UP. THEY LIVE APART. 2 YEARS OF NOT LIVING IN THE SAME CITY. THEY'VE VISITED 3 TIMES. KATE WAS IN MY CLASS. WHEN? A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE YOU. WHAT'S SHE LIKE-- A TOTAL HIPPIE? I'M NOT STARTING IN ON THIS. TELL ME--REGULAR, CRUNCHY, OR EXTRA CRUNCHY? I WON'T SAY IF SHE'S A HIPPIE, BUT SHE DID MOVE TO SEATTLE. [Together] EXTRA CRUNCHY. IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY. I REMAIN AS I HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME-- A CAREFREE, SINGLE LESBO. [Together] LOOKIN' FOR LOVE. I THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE GOOD TOGETHER. YEAH. THAT WOULD BE THE LITTLE RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE? KIA, THIS IS SO WORTHLESS. I WISH YOU'D ADMIT THAT. WHY ARE THEY APART IF THEY'RE SO IN LOVE? YOU KNOW, SHE NEVER MENTIONED LOVE. IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE BUSINESS PARTNERS. EVEN WEIRDER, THERE'S NO REASON THEY SHOULD LIVE APART. I THOUGHT ELY WAS IN SCHOOL. SHE TOLD ME SHE QUIT. SHE'S HANGING AROUND KEEPING DARIA COMPANY? I GUESS. MAYBE ELY AND DARIA... EW! I DON'T THINK SO. DARIA'S A HO. YOU LEAVE DARIA ALONE. WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER OUR COLLECTIVE LESBIAN IMAGE BE-- HOT, PASSIONATE, SAY-YES-TO-SEX DYKES OR TOUCHY-FEELY SISTERS OF THE WOODLANDS? IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE WOMEN WHO ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR SEXUAL SELVES, ESPECIALLY LESBIANS. DARIA'S A POSITIVE '90s ROLE MODEL, AND ELY'S BEHIND THE TIMES. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE DOING IT. ELY SEEMS TOO HONEST FOR THAT. BESIDES, YOU KNOW, HER AND KATE ARE MONOGAMOUS. IT'S PROBABLY MORE OUT OF FEAR AND INERTIA THAN ON PRINCIPLE. ELY'S ALWAYS BEEN TIMID. YOU MEAN OF SEX? IT SEEMS LESS GENERAL-- A FEAR OF INTIMACY. SHE'S IN THIS REALLY COMFY POSITION. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO CONFRONT IT. I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE. I HATE THIS. WHY IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS? I JUST WANT TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND AND HAVE THERE BE NO CATCHES, NO GLITCHES, NO BOOBY TRAPS. AS MUCH AS WE JOKE ABOUT IT, I REALLY JUST WANT TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW COMPLICATED IT WOULD BE. YOU SET ME UP. YEAH. I DESERVE IT. HA HA HA! NO, YOU DON'T DESERVE IT. WE DID GET ALONG, DESPITE HER SEVERE CASE OF HIPPIE-ITIS.

MOTHER INSISTS WE COME TO HER HOUSE FOR THANKSGIVING BECAUSE IT FEELS SO GOOD TO HAVE A MAN AROUND THE HOUSE AT HOLIDAYS. I CAN SINK INTO THE COMFORT OF BEING MOTHER, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW, GRANDMOTHER-- NOT ALWAYS UNCOUPLED IN A FAMILY PORTRAIT, NOT STRAPPED WITH THE AWKWARD TITLE OF "AUNT." I COULD LIVE A LIFE OF GENDER-SPECIFIC PRONOUNS AND ANSWER TRUTHFULLY ABOUT BOYFRIENDS AND MEAN ONLY "GOOD FRIEND" WHEN I SAY IT AND LEAVE OFF THAT DESPERATE QUALIFIER-- "REALLY" GOOD FRIEND. SEX WOULD BE A FRIENDLY RITUAL, ALWAYS FINITE, NEVER FRIGHTENING. I COULD FOCUS ON RESPECT WHILE HE FUCKED ME AND HOW IT FEELS KIND OF GOOD IF YOU ERADICATE THAT UNDERLYING IMAGE OF THE EMPTY HOLE LONGING TO BE FILLED AND TRY NOT TO DWELL ON THE SATISFACTION HE FEELS. DOUBLE INCOME. I COULD KEEP MY OWN NAME, MAYBE HYPHENATE FOR A LIBERATED FEEL. WE COULD HAVE ANNIVERSARY DINNERS IN LOVELY SPOTS. HE'D DASH OFF TO THE WAITER WHILE I'M IN THE LADIES ROOM SO THEY CAN BRING OUT AN ANNIVERSARY TREAT. THE WAIT STAFF WILL FEEL A WARM GLOW. WHAT IF I FIND MYSELF WITH A MORE WEATHERED FACE IN A PARK, LAUGHING, SAYING, "I WAS SO YOUNG," HOLDING HANDS WITH A PARKA AND OLD SPICE WHO SAYS, "I FEEL BETTER, HONEY, "KNOWING YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING AND STILL CHOOSE ME." IT DOESN'T SEEM SO FAR-FETCHED, LIKE BEING CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE AND DYING OR SLIPPING ON OIL THAT SOMEONE ELSE UNWITTINGLY SPILLED. I COULD CHASE A RABBIT THROUGH THE WOODS AND FALL DOWN A LONG, DARK HOLE WHICH ENDS IN A LIFE FROM WHICH I CAN'T ESCAPE. IT'S THE WORD "PHASE." IT'S FINALLY COMING OUT BUT STILL BEING CALLED "GAY." IT'S BEING FUCKED AND SUCKED BY A WOMAN TILL YOU COULD CRY, FEELING THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT YOU REALLY DO. YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR A MAN. I'M NOT WAITING FOR A MAN. I HATE THIS EERIE FEELING THAT A MAN'S WAITING FOR ME. [Man] OUT LAST NIGHT, JUST DOING THE TOWN. HI, MOMMY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DON'T YOU HAVE A HOUSE? DO YOU HAVE A LIFE? [Mother] NO ME BESES. SIENTATE. YO QUIERO HABLAR CONTIGO. EVA ELISA, WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT? I...I WAS... WITH--WITH MARTA. MENTIROSA. JUNIOR TOLD ME WHERE YOU WAS AT LAST NIGHT. HE SAW YOU IN ONE OF THOSE GAY BARS.

SHE SHOULD BE BACK AROUND 7:00. OH, SHIT. EVY, IS SOMETHING WRONG? IT'S FUCKED UP, MAX. JUNIOR TOLD MY MOM EVERYTHING. SHE KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE. HE FUCKING SET ME UP. HE'S SITTING, WAITING FOR SHIT TO COME DOWN. HE KNOWS MY MOM WASN'T GOING TO UNDERSTAND. SHE NEVER WANTS TO SEE MY FACE AGAIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. HOLY SHIT. WHERE THE FUCK IS KIA? I'D LIKE TO GET THAT GUY AND GET A PACK OF DYKES AND CORNER HIM IN AN ALLEY AND MAKE HIM BEG US NOT TO KILL HIM AND THEN KILL HIM ANYWAY. WE SHOULD SQUASH HIM. WE SHOULD GET REVENGE. THE NERVE-- GETTING YOU KICKED OUT OF YOUR OWN HOUSE! MAX, PLEASE, BE QUIET. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN TO BE QUIET. I'M SORRY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. THAT GUY MUST JUST HAVE NO FUCKING LIFE. MAX. SHUT UP, MAX. I CAN'T GET OVER WHAT A DICK HE IS. MAX, LISTEN I'VE JUST GOTTEN KICKED OUT. MY MOM THINKS I'M GOING TO HELL. I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE.

NO, REALLY, BABE, WHEN YOU GOING TO GET BACK INTO THE FRAY? START MATING AGAIN. DARIA, I HAVE A PARTNER. YOU DO NOT. YOU'VE GOT A GOOD EXCUSE, AND IT'S GETTING WEAK. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT. I CAN'T DO THIS NON-MONOGAMOUS, HIP THING. IN ORDER TO BE NON-MONOGAMOUS, YOU HAVE TO BE HAVING SEX WITH EVEN 1 PERSON, RIGHT? AS FOR YOUR HIPNESS, I GUESS THE NEW HAIRCUT HELPS. OH, WHO NEEDS HIPNESS? DO YOU KNOW MAX? YEAH. SHE'S A TOTAL BABE. WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO THAT NIGHT? WE WENT TO A MOVIE. WE TALKED. IT WAS NICE. [Daria] SO WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU GO FOR IT? I THINK SHE'S TOTALLY HOT. [Ely] I'M SURE YOU THINK SHE'S HOT, DARIA. I DIDN'T GO FOR IT. HAVING A BALL AND CHAIN IN A FARAWAY PLACE, BEING GENERALLY PETRIFIED OF ANY INTERACTION EXCEPT FOR DOGS, CATS, AND AN OCCASIONAL FERRET DOESN'T MAKE ME THE HOTTEST COMMODITY AROUND. YOU'RE DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE, GIRL. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER ME. DO YOU LIKE HER? SHE SEEMS KIND OF YOUNG. SHE PROBABLY ONLY TRIED TO KISS ME OUT OF BOREDOM. SHE TRIED TO KISS YOU? DID SHE FAIL? DID YOU GUYS SMOOCH? DID SHE HUMP YOUR LEG? WHAT HAPPENED? 1 LAME KISS, AND THEN KATE CALLED. LET'S JUST DROP IT. I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN... WANT TO DEAL WITH IT? I THINK I'LL HAVE A DINNER PARTY. [Daria] BUT WAIT. HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED, OR IS IT KIND OF WEIRD? WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER AT THE BOOKSTORE. WE HAD A CONVERSATION, BUT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE DATE.
