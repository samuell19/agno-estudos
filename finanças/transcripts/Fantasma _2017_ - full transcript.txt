Subtitles by explosiveskull Dispatch, one-zero. Again, the corner of Roth Hill Road is jammed with police who are combing this crime scene. Cops are talking with area residents. They're trying to put together the pieces that led to this murder. No suspects in custody at this point, meaning the killer according to the police is still at large. I'm your host, Baron Blood, and I will be your guide to the dark. Adriana, wake up. Spook Show Theater. Tonight on Channel 12. Hello, everybody. Hello. Well, that was very good. Now I wanna see how well you boys and girls can sing, and the voices of those out there. I want you to all join me in singing the new Magic Clown song. Watch your television and you sing along with you. I wanna hear how well you've learned it. Are we ready, orchestra? Crank up the band. Dreams again. Visions. Are they in the same vein as before? Yes and no. They seem more surreal. More frightening. It's like a waking nightmare. I'm, I'm trapped and can't escape. Yet, I'm fully aware that I'm dreaming. The suppressed feelings that you have for your mother and your father, combined with all of the feelings that you're having in your current life, they're all coming together in like this, this whirlwind of emotion for you, and their realizing themselves in your dreams, visions. Yeah, but it feels real. You know, one minute I'm in it and everything's fine, and then the next thing there's these, these things, and then there's this dark figure and he, he starts killing everyone around me. Everyone that I know and care about. Anyone that I interact with. Are there any new stressors in your life right now? Um, I, no, I, I don't know if it's stress. It's, it's big though, I, um, I booked, I booked the lead in the Nutcracker this year. - That's great. - Yeah. That's good. You're happy. I am, yeah. So what's the stress? In ballet, it's really competitive between dancers and we always are encouraging each other but everyone wants the lead, and um, Elaina's been the lead every, every Christmas. This is, this is the first, the first time that another dancer has gotten it, so, um, it's just been, I don't know if stressful, it's been tense It's possible that Elaina could be part of this dark figure that you're dreaming about. Yeah, I know. That makes sense, but wouldn't the Enfemerol help with this? I thought that that's, it was supposed to help with the stress and the, and the visions and? The Enfemerol is just an experimental drug. I mean, we're giving you a very, very low dosage just to see if it's going to work. That's not the real medicine, though. The most important medicine for you is your mind. Whenever you're feeling stressed out, this is a very optimal exercise for you, okay? - Okay. - So just relax your shoulders, close your eyes. Now envision yourself on the stage. You're giving the best performance you've ever given in your whole life. The audience is loving it. All the dancers are so proud to be led by you. What does that make you say? Thank you. Gratefulness. Positivity. Adriana, I want you to go out and do things that bring you joy, with no repercussions. You just experience the joy, let it get into every cell of your being, and just stay with it as long as you can. Okay. Okay? Okay. And remember this leather couch here, this is not beginning and end of our therapy. You have an episode, you call me on the phone, anytime. Thank you, Dr. Cassinelli. Carlina, remember? Okay? Okay. Woo. Ow-ooh - Thank you, thank you. - Now that's the stuff. What are you doing here? Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing, but I see you're getting some extra practice in to show the rest of the troupe up, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-huh. I don't need extra practice. Oh, well. No, I'm just kidding. Um, I had a little extra steam I needed to blow off. Well, I'm glad your skinny ass got in a hell of a workout. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. And why is that? 'Cause now you have plenty of room for Italian food and wine, right? Oh, always. I won't tell Ms. Valli if you won't. Please don't. Are these child size? You know my arm wouldn't fit through those. Shut up. Ow. Well, here it is. Well we appreciate you allowing us to write this story. I'll only need a few days to collect the proper sources. I'm the only journalist on the entire project, so what day works best this week for you to let me in? There is never a good day. I could work with your schedule, morning, evenings. I can let you in at 10 a.m. tomorrow. No earlier than that. I have a tour starting at one, I need you outta here by 12:30. You cannot disrupt the tour. Well, when's your tour over? I can let you back in at 8 p.m. Friday night, after my afternoon shift, but I need advance proper notice, and I can't have you moving everything around because I don't wanna have to move everything back again for the tour. Well, I will be respectful. You have my word. Is it true that everyone died? That's what they say. That's terrible. 1892, right? Listen, a word of advice. They don't know they're dead. So don't be asking 'em all these stupid questions like you've been pestering me with. Right. And don't talk to the children. They will follow you home. So, I haven't seen him in years. He shows up straight out of jail, in the carpool line, singing bible songs. No? Yeah, and even when the vice principal told him to stop, he still kept tapping his foot to the beat and told 23 kindergartners, "I just want you people to know, I love you people." Oh yeah, just a small glimpse into my childhood. You know, Ms. Valli says that nothing tastes as good as skinny feels, but I bet that bitch has never eaten pasta. Screw Ms. Valli. Anything else I can get for you ladies? Um, more bread. Bread? Sure. She was a little salty. She probably just had a bad day. Oh. So, what did your parents do about your bible singing Uncle on coke? Oh, he fit it great into our family. After he got kicked out of school, he, ah, came with us on a family trip, where they got high on LSD the whole time. Mm-hmm. The whole state of Florida, they thought they were on a cloud. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. Okay, it makes sense now. I know why we're best friends. - Mm-hmm? - We're both fucked up in the head. - Mm. - Yeah. These meatballs look weird. Mm. Addy? Addy, what is it? You don't like your pasta, what? I'm sorry. Show's over. You want a fucking autograph? It's not real. Adriana, it's not real. You're okay. You're okay. It's not real. It's not real. Do you want a ride home or not, Gigi? No, no, I told you, it's okay. I only live a block away. And as tipsy as you are, you may not make it there. The walk and the fresh air will sober me right up. Just sleep it off. We don't need you too hung over for dance class tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, you too. Alright. Be safe. See you tomorrow. You can take me. You can take me now. We left the club last night around 11. She was drunk but not wasted to the point she couldn't get home. I tried calling her when I got here. It's not like her to be late. She's probably just sleeping it off. It doesn't look good. Ms. Valli won't approve. Huh, what does she approve? Give me that tape right there. Can you hand me the scissors? Thanks. Hey, kiddo. You doing alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen Berna, I'm sorry about last night, I don't know what happened. Don't you dare apologize to me. It's okay. I understand. Thanks. What's going on over there? Oh, Gigi hasn't shown up yet. Ellie said they went clubbing again last night. Are you serious? When will she ever learn? She's never been one to focus on what's important, though. Speaking of what's important, I've got to make my tits look like a 12 year old boy so Ms. Valli thinks I'm making some progress. That's not happening. Shut up. Ow. And Porte de Bra, ladies. Janice, Berna, Elaina soft shoulders. Very nice. Very nice. Adriana, your work is exquisite. Absolutely perfect. Perfect. And ladies, let's go on to our next exercise. Shall we? I know, class today was crazy. Yeah, Ms. Valli was really nice. Look at those. That's kinda creepy. A little bit. They're funny. I like that one. Oh, hey Addy, um, are you doing alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, you sure about that? Yeah, I'm, I'm serious, I'm fine. Um, well your shitfit at the restaurant yesterday didn't seem like you were fine. Yeah, um, I've been meaning to apologize about that, I'm, I'm sorry, Berna. Don't apologize, just what's up? Um, I, I dunno, it's kinda hard to explain. I get these like, I don't know, like, kind of like a panic attack. I've got 'em since I was little but they've been getting worse. But I'm on medicine for them now, so it's helping, I think. Yeah, well you could have fooled me. Berna. Hey, I just, you know, I just, I worry about you. You're my best friend. And I'd hate to have to kick your ass. Huh, yeah, you wish. - Mm-hmm. - If I let you. Shut up. Ow. How can I explain what I can't even comprehend? To dream about someone I've never met. Never seen, over and over. Like a movie playing in my head on constant repeat. I can smell her sweet perfume. I feel as though I could touch her. Taste the saltiness of her skin. Who is she? What is she? And why is she haunting my dreams? Or is this simply a sign of something preeminent? Or have I gone mad? She couldn't have been from the facility. Welcome back my little ones. It's your old pal, Baron Blood. Here to bring you another creepy episode of Channel 12's Spook Show Theater. Tonight's movie is the dastardly classic, Night of the Living Dead. Igor? Yes, master? Roll the film. Right away, master. My parents will be home in an hour. So what, you want me to just stop? I know, but what if they came home early? You know? Well, I guess they can just watch. Maybe I should get that. What, why? What if it's my parents? Elaina, we're kind of in the middle of something right now. Okay, sure, fuck it. Don't be such a prick, Seth. Hello? Yeah, I'm, I'm home. Yeah, I'm fine, why? What? What is it, is she okay? Mom, what's going on? Mom? Are you there? Seth? Seth? Are you still here? Every time something negative comes up, you have to replace it with a positive feeling. We talk about this all the time. It's not easy, it's not easy. It's Gigi. What, what about her? She was, um, found yesterday morning. The police think it was a break-in. What do you mean found? She's dead, Addy. No, what? And they found her in a pool of her own blood. Some sick bastard slit her throat and removed her eyes. What? - Oh, God. - No, no, no, no. This is not happening again. - This is not happening. - Oh my God, you've heard. - No, no, no, no, God, no. - I'm sorry, girls, I'm so.... Don't touch me. Addy, calm down. Don't tell me to fucking calm down. No. Do you hear what you said? Her throat was slit. Oh my, God. Oh my, God. Oh my, God. Oh, baby. You broke my heart, you broke my fucking heart. My girls, what's happening to my girls? Oh, God. Hello? Warren, is that you? Warren? Don't need that bill. Okay. Ew. Blast. Squeak. And scratch. That pouch. He's been chasing you for this pouch? I'm too weak to make it to Port Hill right now, but I can throw him off your trail. Just make sure you guard that pouch with your life. Good luck. Hello? Dr. Cassinelli, it's Adriana. What's going on, what's wrong? I don't know who else to talk to. Well, tell me what's going on? You have to calm down, okay? Just, what's happening? The visions, the, the nightmares, they just keep coming back, and... Okay, stop. You just have to breathe. Okay, you have to stop and relax and breathe for a second because I can't understand you. I can't keep going through this. I need you to relax. No, I can't, I can't. Calm yourself, breathe. Okay? Okay, come over, we'll talk about it, we'll get through this, okay? Together. Okay. Don't worry. Okay. I'm coming. Okay, tell me what's going on. My mind. My visions, they're coming real. I'm going crazy, Carlina. You are not going crazy, stop it. Grab ahold of yourself. They're not real. - No. - I guess nothing that I've said to you's mattered, has it? - Has it? - No, it has. It has, I've been trying. Carlina, I've been trying. I tried the positivity exercise, - I tried to say it wasn't real. - I wanna, I wanna show you something, okay? Look, I have been listening to everything that you've told me, okay? Everything that you've been going through. I've been listening to you. I found this book. It's all about dreams and the supernatural. People in it, they have seen these old, dead, creatures. See that, that's like what you described to me. They're called the Malevolent. Alright, they're based on religions, legends, and folklore. Yes, they are. And you what know they are? They're, they're spiritual beings or supernatural entities. Those, those are what I saw in my visions. These are what I've seen in my visions. They're real. They are not real. I got this book to show you that it is not real. Not that it's real. This is supernatural. This is fiction. - No. - There are reasons that people see these things. They have visions. It's because of your parents and your situation, or it's because of hallucinations, or, or sleep paralysis or something can bring this on. No, no it's real. It's not from sleep, it's, I'm not, it's not psychological, it's not in my mind, it's real. My visions are coming true. Gigi died and Bernie told me, and Bernie would never lie to me. Bernie would not lie to me. Listen to me. Look at you. Look at you. This is not the girl I know. Pull yourself together. Do you trust me? Yes. You trust me? Just trust me. Stop crying. I need you to leave me alone. Whatever you are. Remember what I told you. This is in your mind. You can control this. This is not you. I can't. I need you. What do you want from me? I can't tell you. I can only show you. I need you to leave me alone. What do you need to show me? Come with me. I remember when you, me and Elaina were little. We used to beg our parents to bring us here. Gosh, we used to play for hours. I'm gonna miss you so much. Okay. Okay. No, no, please, please, no. Please, don't. Adriana? Adriana? Oh. Shit. Oh, no. Morning news rundown, I'm David Shifter. A 24 year old Richmond woman was found dead in her apartment this morning. Police say Gigi Langdon was murdered in a brutal attack. Neighbors reported hearing a commotion over night. Police are investigating the possibility the crime is connected to the murder of another woman, Elaina Kemper. The motive behind the incident - remains a mystery this hour, - Elaina. as does the identity of... Oh, my God. Ms. Valli? Hi, sweetie. Up here. What's going on? Elaina's body was found this morning. She was murdered the way Gigi was. What? Huh, what is happening? The police are shutting down the school. Their investigation is centered around the employees here. And I've got some more bad news. Janice's parents filed a missing person on her this morning. So this is it then? Warren and I are packing up, locking the doors this afternoon. I know, honey. I know. You don't have to hang around. Go out, have fun. I'm gonna go check on Addy. But be careful. What trauma? What trauma? Maybe, maybe, maybe. Okay. Officer's were called to a home at 4 Thomas Street on Sunday just after 11 p.m. They found the bodies of Darren Mena, 44, and his wife, Juliana, 40, both of who died from injuries they suffered due to multiple stab wounds and slicing to their jugulars. The most heinous act of this crime was the fact that both the Mena's eyes had been removed by a blade after they succumbed to their injuries. Oh, my God. The only survivor, the Mena's eight year old daughter, Adriana. Police still have no suspects at this point. Addy? Are you okay? Addy? Where are you? I'm afraid. Addy, what happened? Berna, I'm losing my mind. I'm scared. I can't sleep, but I can't be awake anymore. I can't, I'm losing my mind. I can't control my mind anymore. I can't control it. It's alright, it's okay, it's okay. I don't want you to see me lose my mind. Listen, listen, hey, c'mon, c'mon. Hey, hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Okay. Yeah. Addy, what's the matter? No. Addy, come on. No, run. Run. No. Addy? Addy, please. Please don't do this. I don't wanna hurt you. Please. Please. Please. Please. Don't do this. Please. Addy. This isn't you. This isn't my best friend. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hey, Adriana, it's Carlina. I'm, ah, a little worried, I tried calling your cell phone. Um, look, I, I really wanted to discuss some things with you, ah, and talk to you about last night, but I guess you're not home right now, so I'm gonna try stopping by the theater. Um, yeah, I really hope that you're gonna talk to me. Okay, uh, see you over there, I hope, bye-bye. I'm gonna miss you. Warren? Warren? We're wrapping it up, babe. C'mon. Warren, what the fuck? So, I'm supposed to follow you. So where would I follow you? You are, you are a dancer. You're a dancer. Where would dancers be? Dance schools. Dance recitals. Costume shops. Dance theaters. Adriana, this isn't you. Stop it. Adriana. I've been murdered. I am Adriana. I'm a murderer. Is anyone here? Adriana? Adriana? Adriana? Ah, shit. Shit. You look at me. Look at me. It's me. Doctor Cassinelli. Remember what I told you. This is in your mind. You can control this. This is not you. Adriana, c'mon, you gotta fight it. Fight it. Adriana? You have to fight this. You have what is known as a dissociative identity disorder. You have a split personality. Only you can't control it, it is controlling you. Adriana, stop this. You can stop it. Do you know why they never found the killers of your parents? Because it was you. That's right. You created another identity that was evil. Out of, out of a need to, to disenfranchise yourself with your emotions. You need to control this. Carlina. I know. Okay, okay. I don't understand. I don't understand, I didn't mean to do it. I don't understand, I, I, I took the medicine you gave me. I took it, you, you said it would help me and it didn't help me. I took the medicine, I took it. And I still killed them, but I didn't, I didn't kill. It made the other personality stronger. Sorta Like an alpha personality. And it's been in control every since, honey. But you've gotta fight it, okay? No. No. What? Carlina, run. Fight it. Carlina, run. No, I'm not going. Run. No. Come on. No. They're here. You're not welcome here. You're not welcome. This is my body. Leave. Leave, leave leave. Carlina? Carlina? I'm so, so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Just take me. Just take me already. My last few months on earth were full of lessons. I was forced to face the past, and ultimately acknowledge the truth about myself. I was a killer. I not only killed my parents, but went on to kill every person in my life who loved me, uplifted me, supported me Those who I cared about the most, I destroyed. My psyche dissociated. It served to protect me from facing the consequences of what I had done by repressing the truth. However, it also constantly reminded me of how I truly felt about myself, and I believed myself to be unworthy, unlovable, bad, evil, and that I only deserved judgment and punishment. When I was chosen to be the lead in the ballet, the fragmented part of my mind was brought to the surface, and the killer that I had repressed became active again. I couldn't handle something good happening to me when I felt at the core of my being that I only deserved punishment. I was living out an extreme version of the mind tricks that most people play out on themselves daily. I just realized it too late. Subtitles by explosiveskull
