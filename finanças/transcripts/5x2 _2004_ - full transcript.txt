Actually I cannot make it. Yes, yes. It went well. I call you back. I'm with Gilles. We're in a caf?. Kisses. - My mother. - Is that so? I was supposed to have lunch with her. I forgot. - Is she ok? - As usual. And your father? We don't talk anymore. - Has he left? - No, he's still there. They will never split. Kiss me. Why do you close your eyes? You don't want to see my face? Listen. This is ridiculous. I should never have come. It's stupid. Alright. Stop. We stop! - What's the matter? - I don't feel like it. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Gilles! Do you think I could kill myself for you? Jerk. I'm off. Stay for a while. I need to talk. Please. What did you want us to discuss regarding Nicolas? The school holidays. You want me to take him? - You're not working? - I can take time off. I was thinking of sending him to my mother's - Did you ask him what he wants? - No - Where would you take him? - I don't know. Skiing maybe. Fred's renting a chalet. Isn't he too young for skiing? These days they start them younger and younger. It will be good for him. Maybe We must tell him about it. - I call you to let you know. - Do you have someone? No. I already told you. Don't you miss it? No. It's rather good to be on my own again. Flings? Nothing serious. - Do I know them? - No. You? Still with Christine? Yup. Everything ok? So so. It's not easy for me either. - You don't look so bad. - I'm glad this is over and done with. Glad. - Glad is good... - What...? - Nothing. You're something else, that's all. - Something? I don't know. You get naked, you get fucked, you're happy. - Go ahead, fuck off. Go get fucked elsewhere. - Stop it! You've won. I'll wait for your call regarding Nicolas. I neither won nor lost. It's over, that's all You are right, as always. It's over, nothing left to say. Marion! How about we give it another try? Open the garage door. Great. Mummy is back. We are here. Good evening my loves. I bought a cake. You prepared everything? Looks good. I must admit I'm rather fed up. I had a very tiring day. I'm exhausted Can you take the boy? I'd like to take a shower. I touch up my make-up then you can have the bathroom. - You look fine. - I'll be quick. - You still want noodles? Not really right... Dessert? You don't want a dessert? Is it for them you're making yourself so pretty? Idiot, you re making me smudge. - Take him. - Shall we go read a story? One afternoon, while she was making an airplane... She waters new flowers... Aren't they pretty? One afternoon, while she was making a paper airplane, the door opened. - Who was it? - Leon. Here I am, Leon! What are they doing? - They are hugging. - He didn't close the door. He was so happy he forgot to close the door. They're here. - Good evening! - How are you? Good. You? - You're alone? - He has not arrived yet? - No. You were not coming together? - He got busy last minute. I hope he won't bail out. If he hasn't called, he's coming. You know him, so unpredictable. - Gilles is not here either? - Showering. - Things are better between you guys? - Better. I'll tell you later. - What would you like to drink? - Gin please. Beautiful dress. Looks gorgeous on you. Where did you get it? - It was my mother's. - Really? - Hello - How are you? - Nicolas gone to bed yet? - Yes. - Did he cry? - Just a bit. Two lesbian girlfriends of mine just had a baby. I visited them at the hospital. Adorable. How did they do it? With a friend and a spoon, the most efficient. - Spoon? - Their gay friend jerked off into the spoon... The girl introduced the sperm in her vagina using the spoon! - Very odd. - Why not, if it works? What do you tell the kid when he grows up? The truth. - Good luck to you. - Marion, I find you awfully traditional. The sperm spoon is the future. It's more useful than a hetero husband. Nonsense. I was hoping to ask your wife to be my surrogate mother, but I guess that won't work... - Is your boyfriend coming? - He should be. I don't know what he's doing. - Should I call him? - He'll be here shortly. I don't believe in fidelity. It's impossible, and it serves no purpose. - Do you agree? - He's right. - Being faithful is not natural. - Respect for the spouse, trust... Every couple has its lies and little secrets... It's perfect that way. Frankly, why resist temptation? What for? - To have regrets? - No. To feel stronger, for having resisted. Marion, you always amaze me. Gilles, what do you think? Nothing special. Liar. - What do you want me to say? - Certainly not the truth. Then... I've never cheated on Marion. I've already cheated on Christophe twice. It didn't count, just flings with men coming through. - And you told him? - Of course. I tell him everything. He's young. I cannot stop him. And so far he always comes back to me. You're not jealous. What for? I'm an old thing. I did the same when I was his age. And I always like to have a third party. It lets me have some respite, some rest. What about you? Did you ever cheat on me? What would you like me to answer? - No, of course. - Incredible, I must forgive your errors... - ... but I must remain faithful. - That's my mediterranean, macho side. I only cheated on Marion once. - You think that's the right time? - Well, we're all here pouring our hearts out... Only fags can be unfaithful? - I'm sure you'd love to hear a good hetero cheating story. - Why not if it's funny. Funny maybe not, but interesting. - Maybe you'd rather not, Marion. - I don't mind. - Maybe we'll leave you guys alone now. - No. I'm curious to hear the story he wants to tell you. It was 1.5 year ago, at some friends' place. We hadn't seen them since our wedding. They had organised a party at their place, 30 km away from Paris. Nice ambiance, 20 guests, music, fun people. Everyone was drunk. Around midnight our friend lowered the lights. We understood that, for those who wanted, the evening would turn into an orgy. - That's great. - Rather surprising. Especially since we didn't know them that well. We were a bit drunk I was rather tickled by it. Women started to undress and lie down on mattresses. The men folllowed. It was well organised. Poppers, jelly, condoms, even coke. First we watched from our little corner. Marion took my hand... squeezed it real hard. I asked her if she wanted to try. You answered 'No'. But go ahead if you want. I told you I'd only go with you. But you insisted I go alone. You just wanted to watch. That's all. A girl came to fetch me and I went. While Marion was watching from the shadows... You had sex with this girl in front of Marion? Not only with the girl. Even with men. - You did stuff with guys? - Yeah, I took advantage. - I now know how my brother feels. - You're having us on! What did you do to the guys? Run of the mill stuff. Sucked a few cocks, got fucked... - You got fucked in the ass? - Fucked in the ass? Marion, it's not true. Please tell me you didn't take part in... Yes it's true. Shall we move to the living rooom? - I must get going. - Oh no! There's this party I promised to drop by. - Christophe, are you leaving too? - Matthieu, you want me to... Up to you. Techno music, only young people. Don't know if you'll like it. - Just what he likes - We'll see each other later then I'll call you when I'm done. Thanks for everything. It was great. - My pleasure. - See you soon. - I'll call you. - Bye Marion. I'll walk you out. Good bye. - Nice boy this Mathieu - You like him? Yes. Nice, smart... - And he knows what he wants. - Yes. I'm glad you like him. I think he got along well with Marion. Yes I think so. We're good together. Don't you want to clean the plates under the tab before putting them in the machine? - Where's the aluminum foil? - I don't know. I'm happy for your brother. Why? Seeing him in love like that. It's not that frequent. I find it rather pathetic. - Why do you say that? - The boy doesn't give a shit about him. He went to his party alone. He won't last long. It's amazing. When it comes to your brother... ...you are always pessimistic. And you optimistic. It won't last a week. How do you know? Just because it's not conventional doesn't mean they'll fail. The most important is trust. Are you sure? He told me they were not having sex. Gilles - What? - What are you doing? Nothing. He was crying. - Are you coming? - Let me sleep. It's a boy. - Have you thought of a name? - Yes. We don't agree. - Anything wrong otherwise? - No. Apart from the slight discharge this morning. - Strange. - What? Has he been moving a lot lately? No. He's rather more quiet. Is anything wrong? The placenta's position is off. I'm afraid it might block the baby's exit. Is that serious? No. If it bleeds too much we'll just have to induce. Yes, darling. What's the matter? Aren't you at the clinic? Really? Why? Yes I'm here. I'm coming right away. Don't worry. Delphine, I'm bringing a dossier over. No more calls. Now you turn up? We've been waiting for you for 3 hours. Marion was beside herself. - Is she ok? - It was not easy. She's in her room, resting. She's sedated. And the baby? In the incubator. He's small. They had a tought time getting him out. The epidural didn't work; she went through hell. Where were you? We left messages! I was caught in traffic. Marion didn't understand, she was worried. Since you were not here, I attented the operation. It was not pretty. She bled a lot. Fortunately they could perform a C-section. Back in my days it would not have been so fast and efficient... As you know, I lost my first child. Yes, you told me. Are you sure it's this one? Yes, he's tiny. Number 5. You're sure it's not that one on the left? I guarantee you it's Number 5. Why? You don't like him? He looks so fragile... The midwife explained it to me. The membrane was not playing its role so he stopped growing. That's why he's small. They noticed it early. Otherwise he could have died in her belly. I was told not to worry. He should end up with normal weight and height. They grow up naturally, problem-free. Gilles, what's wrong? You're not feeling well? - I'm fine; I just need 5 minutes of fresh air. - Do you want me to come along? I'm fine thanks. I'll wait for you in the waiting room. Yes. When you're back we'll check on Marion together. See you shortly. Oh shit. Hello Gilles Is he born yet? Yes. Marion is resting. - Are you happy? - Yes. We were not expecting him so early, but... Problems always come at the wrong time. - Is Monique around? - In the waiting room. Did she freak out? Pardon? She must be so happy she must be hysterical. - Maybe. I don't know. - She's always hysterical anyway. I'm going to see my daughter and the little monster. Coming along? I finish my cigarette. Are your parents here? I haven't called them yet. See you in a while. Answering machine. Incredible! I hope nothing happened to him. You just gave birth, and you're worried about him! You don't know what you're talking about. He's not the one who just had a c-section. I'm not surprised. When I lost the baby, your dad was not around either. - He had bigger fish to fry. - Are you gonna shut your big mouth? What's with you? Can't you leave your daughter in peace for 5 minutes? You're ressassing the same old boring stuff. Is it my fault if Gilles is not here, just like you 30 years ago?!? When there's a problem you only know how to disappear. Cut it out! Your father started it. Shut up! That's all we ask of you. I leave you to rest. Bye dad. Thanks for coming. You saw the way he spoke to me. It's no big deal. At least he came. It doesn't mean he can yell at me like that. Go after him. You think so? You know he's waiting for you in the car. Yes Have a good rest. Hello? - It's me - Where are you? I'll explain. It's rather complex. You ok? No Why? Nothing. It's me. I'm in pain. Why aren't you here? Why did you leave? I don't know. I'm sorry. Did you decide on the name yet? - Haven't thought about it. - What would you like? I don't know. What about you? You wanted Nicolas? Yes, I like Nicolas. Nicolas it is. - Marion? - Yes? I love you. Can you pop by the house and bring me some clothes? Marion? Has a marriage contract been drawn up? Yes. In application of Article 75 of the civil code... ...I will read through articles 212 to 215... ...on the rights and duties of the spouses. 212. spouses must be faithful and supportive of each other. 213. They will jointly assume the moral and financial management of the family. they will provide for their children's education and future. 214. Spouses contribute... ...according to their respective capacity. Finally 215. The spouses must live in community with each other. Miss Marion Chabard... Do you take Mr Gilles Ferront for husband? I do. Mr. Gil Ferront, do you take Miss Marion Chabard for wife? I do. I hereby declare you legally married. Congratulations. I want you. - Are you happy? - Yeah I'm happy. - I can't hear you. - Yes. I can't take off my dress. - I can't take it off. - Never mind. No! I'll go take it off. Keep the garterbelt on but take off your panties! Oh this is nice... I didn't take off my panties. Would you like a little strip-tease? I already don't excite you anymore? Gilles, are you asleep? Good night my love. You scared me. I love you, I love you, I love you. It's cool. Come in. Jellyfish, jellyfish! Good evening. I just arrived from the airport. - Are you Marion Chabard? - Yes - Did you have a good trip? - So so An animator will take you to your room straight away. You room number is 230 - You are not superstitious, are you? - No, no. I feel good after our swim. It's not that bad here after all. Now you see that you could trust me. And it's not too crowded. It's still strange though, all those people coming alone. They're single and looking for a fling. How dreadful. I would never come here alone. Why not? It's like a match-making agency. I find it very sad. - You can't help it. - What? - Always criticizing. - I'm not criticizing, just stating facts. - Is the weather nice? - Yes. I slept well. Did you hear a raucous this morning? No. What was it? Dunno. In the corridor, doors slamming... - I heard nothing. - Do you want a piece of bread? Yes. Pardon me. - Marion? - Yes? Mr Ferront, what are you doing here? I should be asking you that; I thought you were in Senegal? My friend dropped out, so I just booked any trip. That's funny. I'm here with my girlfriend. You were not in the plane. When did you get it? I missed the plane. Came in last night. Are you here with someone? No, alone. Then come have lunch with us later. Yes, why not? So strange to bump into each other here. I didn't expect to see you in a swimsuit one day. - See you later, in the restaurant. - See you. Who was that? A girl who works for us - ad department. Incredible to meet her here. You didn't know she was coming? We hardly know each other Are you jealous? You are jealous. Told her to join us for lunch. She's alone. Is she nice? I don't know. We'll see. Coming here alone doesn't bother you? It does, but my girlfriend canceled at the last minute.. We were supposed to go to Senegal. Next time I guess... Would have been very different holidays. And it was not a package tour at all. It was more of an adventure. Exactly what I would have liked to do. - Why didn't you? - Don't ask me... - I could only take 1 week. Impossible. - Gilles works too hard... I wanted to take 2 weeks to visit Sicily before coming here... ...Next time for me too. Sicily is very beautiful. You've been there? My boyfriend was from Sicily. Went there a few times to visit his family. - You don't feel like going back? - Not for the time being. We broke up 4 months ago, I don't feel strong enough yet. - I'm sorry. - It's ok. you didn't know. Anyway it's over. Concentrate, we can't get a decent rally going. No need to get upset. Do you have water? Thanks. Ah shit. There. You pick them up. Bravo! it was really funny. You move well. I'm used to it. That's how we communicate in the office. I didn't understand anything. I don't speak Italian. You didn't miss much. Do you want to go for a drink next door? Not me. We're getting up early for the mountain trek but Gilles... Not if you're not coming, no. - Good luck for tomorrow. - Good night. Why didn't you go? You did not fancy a drink? No, it's ok. - May I sit here? - Sorry, this seat is taken. I thought you did not want a drink? Do you want one? I find this girl touching. Who? Marion You're trying to sell her to me or what? I think she's pretty and very nice. That's all. Would that turn you on if I fucked her? It would turn you on, not me. You're right, I feel like fucking tonight. - You look comfy here. - Ah! it's you? - Hello. - Hello. Can I sit down? Sure. Weren't you supposed to go trekking? Valerie went alone. I didn't feel like it. I felt like sleeping late and getting a tan. It's really nice here. Yes. It's real quiet. Not like the club How was the disco? Nice. I went back early. Alone? Why are you asking me this? I don't know... But going to a disco alone... ...makes it easier to meet people? You really don't know me. I only went there to dance. Have you gone for a swim yet? No. I was told the sea here is dangerous... - ... fairly strong currents. - Is that so? - The sea looks so calm, though. - Yes. Have you been with someone since your previous boyfriend? No. I don't feel like it. Not yet. Have you been with Valerie for a long time? 4 years Are you married? Why do you ask me that? I don't know... No. We're thinking about it. Shall we go for a swim? OK.
