Make yourself at home. Would you like some water? Yes please. How many people live here? Three. Me, my brother, who's her father, and her. I'm living here temporarily. I'm getting married later this year. And her mother? Her mother is deceased. I'm sorry. She died two years ago in an accident. I shouldn't have asked. It's okay. How many bathrooms? One. And TV sets? Also one. But it's a touch screen TV. Does your brother work? Yes, with construction. He's a mason. Please sign this, just to confirm you were present at the exhumation. Can we proceed? Go ahead, Josue. They broke the bones to fit them into the bag. Drink it. Go home, I'll cover for you. Home.. You're so hot. - Come on, Elton, stop. - It'll only be a minute. - Dalva's home. - It's fine. Hey Dalva, how are you? Go play in the house, Dalva. Guess I'll be going, then. Yeah, before traffic gets worse. And maybe after I'm done with my client, we could.. Have some pizza, hang out, I don't know. Sounds great. I'll call you when I'm done. Send me a picture when you get home. We're back together. I'm the one who made him come back. That's not true, Dalva. He came back by himself. No, it was me. "Under my left food I hold you, I keep you," "I tie you." "Make it so that Elton doesn't eat or sleep," "So that he pays no mind to other women." "This time, make it work." "This time, make it work." "This time, make it work." "St. Anthony, hold my man, hold my marriage." What's that? Grown up stuff. Witchcraft? This is serious. You hear? Not play stuff. Let me tell you something: We seal the deal with blood. The secret lies in the blood. Don't say a word of this to your dad. Promise me. I promise. The Father's Shadow Is she going to stay in that same graveyard? Yes. At a storage area in which they keep the.. It's cheaper, right? Less money to burn. No use paying to keep the dead, dead. Did you see mom's body? Dalva. Your mom is in Heaven. What was inside the coffin? Enough, Dalva. She's my mom. There were bones, dear. Bones. And whatever was left of her yellow flower dress. What's this? It's the rest of her stuff. They were gonna throw it away. This will not stay in the house. There are way too many bugs there. It's for the girl. You're gonna throw it away. It's for the girl. Dalva. Dalva. Dalva, open the door. Where's the box? I buried it in the garden. Dalva, dead people belong in the graveyard. God alone.. Hey, your bean didn't sprout. And yours is going to die. What happened to your seed? Bye, teacher. Bye. Bye, teacher. Goodbye. Yeah.. Looks like it's dead. Ouch. Stop it, hey. Abigail, you two are making too much noise. There, there, sweetie. Try keeping it down, okay? She doesn't like me anymore. Hold my hands. Close your eyes. Say it with me: "I love my mom." "I love my mom." - "I want her back." - "I want her back." - "Spirit who hears me." - "Spirit who hears me." - "Bring her back to me." - "Bring her back to me." - "I love my mom." - "I love my mom." - "I want her back." - "I want her back." - "Spirit who hears me." - "Spirit who hears me." - "Bring her back to me." - "Bring her back to me." What? You're so damn quiet. Need to get laid. Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Nunes. - Good morning. Almiro, I need to talk to you. - Right now? - Yes, now. - Let's go. - Sure. He left you, huh? Leave me alone, you little devil. He'll be back. You're there. Where's your aunt? She and Elton had a fight. As always. That necklace looks beautiful on you. Dad, I'm starting to forget Mom's face. That's how it is; you're supposed to. Hey. Hey, Almir? Where were you yesterday? How was your talk with Nunes? Come on, out with it. I was fired, Jorge. What did he say? Cost-cutting measure. Next week, I'm out. Was it just you who was fired? I don't know. There are probably more people. Did you tell him you had a family? Rosa and the boys? Who doesn't have a family around here, Jorge? I brought these cups; I improvised because we're out. So, I was telling them that I brought rose wine because it's an honor for me to become an official part of the family. Yeah, we.. It was all pretty sudden for us, too. It was also kind of a surprise for us. And.. Don't you want some? And Elton got the apartment. I was just waiting for it to be cleared. - An apartment downtown. - Great location, near the subway. Near stores, drugstores. Cheers. And Elton also got a new job. Well, to be honest, it isn't quite a "job". I became my own boss. I now represent "Goji Nature". Selling pills that act inside out from chromosomes to cells. Here: "Goji Berry". It's an American product for weight loss. Blueberry. They're natural products. Herbal products. And, it's what I always say: "'Goji Berry': you take it, disappear, and don't feel it." - This is good wine. - Right? The party is going to be at his family's country house in Campinas. - A barbecue. - Barbecue? For fucks sake. Don't say that, it's my wedding. What are you doing about Dalva? So that's what you want? New house, wanna have kids? Don't be retarded, Cristina. Wake the fuck up. I give you two weeks to be back at home. I can't watch this. Jesus. Dalva, you're the woman of the house now. You'll have to take care of both you and your dad. Your dad is big, but dumb. A man.. Thank you. For the help you gave me with Elton. It worked. Dalva. You need to be careful with that gift of yours. You can't use it to hurt other people. Or else, it'll all come back at you. - Ouch. - Keep your head still. What's wrong? It's Saint John's Day, Dalva. It's not just any day, you have to look your best. See? You look beautiful. Here, I got them for you. It's those.. Firecrackers, sparklers and stuff. Don't light them up near the fire, okay? - Why not? So you don't burn your own face off. Hello? Yeah. No, just a second, I can't talk here. "How many here listen The faithful eyes" "How many elements Love that woman" "How many men were winter, others summer" "As autumn falling dry In the soil of my hand" "Groaned and moaned The tip of the spur" "The leaf of the sensitive plant And the fear of loneliness" "Poison my companion Unleash in the singer" "And fall into the first dam of my love" "It's when weather shakes the long hair" "The fully red braid" "A blind eye wanders, looking for one" Look at what she's wearing. What are you two doing here? None of your business. - They look ridiculous. - Tell me about it. I hope you die. Burned alive. I hope you die. I hope you die. (repeating) What time does your school start? I'm on vacation. I gotta work night shifts on some days, you know. I can't look after you 24/7. I know. Don't answer the door for strangers, okay? Only for the lunch lady. Her name is.. Neide. No, Nara? Gilmara. Right. Everything's gonna be alright. Woah, you're bleeding, man. I think there's some medicine at the lookout. Fucking construction.. Let's go. No, you go on. Go home. And what am I gonna tell them? Rosa, the boys? Nothing. You know what, Jorge? I wish I had a motorcycle. I'd drive around without a helmet. Living on the edge. Stop it! Stop! Go home. Cool your head. I'll go home. I'll go now. Abigail! Abigail! I don't know, this whole thing sounds fishy. I think it was no accident. Can they prove if it was or not? They can do anything. Plus, if it was suicide, his family won't see a dime. Frankly, I think it's pretty likely.. You're crazy. Of course it was an accident. Well, the guy upstairs asked us to clean Almir's locker. Since you were his pal.. Better safe than sorry. Like I always say, never mess with safety. Give Fernando back there. Next week, a new shipment of helmets is coming to whoever has a worn or damaged one. Just ask me about it. WORK SAFETY GUIDE What time is it? Does it hurt? Kind of. Calm down, it'll be over soon. Why is this still here? There was no one to clean it up. We'll clean it up. - My bad. - For fucks sake, man! You have to sign the receipt. Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Hi, Dad. Do you want a mint? How about you, Dalva? Those with Mr. Jorge da Silva? Stay, Dalva. Sit down a little. The doctor said you have a wound on your back. Let me see it. It's just a scratch. Have you been drinking? Yet another thing to worry about. - Let me see that wound. - Go away. You know that it was Dalva who brought you here, right? All by herself. In the middle of the night. Your daughter. Here. What did the doctor say? That I'm fine. I'm great. You don't look like it. There's so much, Dalva. I can help. Put your finger here. Come on. Now close your eyes. Come on, Dad. Is anyone here? Is anyone here trying to hurt Dad? Is there any spirit here trying to hurt my dad? Enough! Nonsense. Go to your room. Go to your room! Stop it, you're gonna hurt him. What happened, Dalva? Tell me. My dad's sick. Sick with what? He has a huge gash on his back. It gets rotten every day. He's becoming a zombie. Do you want to be my blood sister? You can use my blood. You sure? Now I'm you; your power is in my blood. That's not how it works. We'll see. Begone from my life. Begone from my life, Cecilia. Begone. Begone from my life. (repeating) Do you like it? It's spelled wrong. I know, Dalva. Their "L" was sold out. Is Abigail coming? My bad. I'm gonna blow up another balloon. Did you buy her a gift? Here. Give it to Dalva, tell her you bought it. Elton and I have been talking, and.. We think it would be best for Dalva to come and live with us, for awhile. Until you.. Until things get more stable. Did she ask you that? No. But we think that it would be for the- You're not good for her. Did you know she's now talking to spirits? Jorge, that's children stuff. Stay away from Dalva. Here. Jorge. - I'm only eating half of it, okay? - Okay. It's good. Glad you like it. Don't think we forgot about your birthday present, Dalva. It's from your aunt and me. I got you a bigger size so you can wear it all the way until next year. Thank you. You can use it to go to the park, to school. Here. This is your dad's. He picked it out. Thank you, Dad. It has a switch, let me. Hold this, Dalva. Look. - Is it bad? - It's closed, surrounded. They have an open channel for this. That's what attachment does. So, look who's here. Did you go to the supermarket by yourself, Dalva? "What is severed from the Earth, the Heavens connect." "Row, row" "If I don't row, I'll fall into the water" "Mom, bring it to me" "Put me in your place" "Put me in your place" Cut with it three times. "What's bad goes away, what's good stays" "Mother, bring me compassion," "so my life can have light." I'm leaving, okay? What are you growing there? I left a dessert for you, for your father. Banana flavored. Here, it's for you. There's only good stuff. Only white magic. (indistinct speech) "..Friendship with dear people.." "..Family harmony.." I came to pick up some stuff. "Noah!" "Come back to me." "Come back to us." Dad, stop, that's mine! I don't want that voodoo crap in my house! It's not voodoo! - Only crazy people do that. - Dad, no, stop! Enough! Come on, get up. We're going for a walk. Like a normal family. You and me. Eat up. Eat it. Sit. Sit, now. Dad, stop! Dad, stop! Come back to me, Mom. Come back to us. There's no more food. I'm bringing Mom back. What? I'm bringing Mom back! Your mom is dead. But her spirit isn't. Your mom is dead, in a graveyard drawer. You should've died in her place. You hear me? You're a monster! Dalva. Jorge. Dalva? Dalva? Dalva.. What are you doing in here? Come out now. That's right. Bye. "Bring to my side those who loved me and left." "Bring to my side those who loved me and left." (repeating)
