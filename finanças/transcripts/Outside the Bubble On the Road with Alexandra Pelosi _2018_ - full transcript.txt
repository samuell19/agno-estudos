Subtitles by explosiveskull There's a strange energy radiating through the country right now. America has taken a turn. - USA! USA! - America, the country, is as divided as it has been in 150 years since the Civil War. If you watch cable news, it seems as if civility has reached an all-time low. We're more divided than ever, and our identity, what makes us all American, has never been more fragile. You're ugly! You're ugly! Get the hell out of here! You're fucking dumb! You're uneducated! Get the fuck out of here! - It's all about Jesus! - What do you know about Jesus, faggot? I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. Ever since Donald Trump became president, many Americans have a sense that they finally have someone who understands them. Enough people in this country are tired of feeling left behind. But in my America, my neighbors have been dressing up like parts of the female anatomy and marching in protests. What we rarely see on TV is people having genuine conversations with people who they don't agree with. We are making America great again, baby! Taking our country back! It has been said that where you stand on an issue depends on where you sit. Well, I may live in liberal America, but I know that this is not the only America. So, I'm bursting out of my own bubble and setting out on a pilgrimage to meet people in communities across this country where the big issues have erupted... It is not a gun control that this country needs, it's God control. ...to see what we can learn from listening to our fellow Americans. These plants do not produce enough crap to cause the climate to change. If you break into this country, you should be deported. We're at a crossroad anyway. Nobody wants to see color, but... if you're white, then you're on the downside, I guess, you know. We have the greatest president of all-time, and, you know, things are really headed in the right direction. So, you think God put Trump in office? I know he did. I'm going on a road trip into the heart of America, to meet voters who don't see the world the way I do... - He's kicking ass! - Kicking ass! ...to get a better understanding of where they're coming from on the big issues that divide us. USA! USA! One of the most divisive issues in America today is guns. If you wanna talk about guns, a good place to start is in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where a gunman walked into this church and killed 26 people, including 12 children. Every time there's a mass shooting in America, it quickly turns into a debate about gun control. Mental health is the problem here, but this isn't a guns situation. I mean, fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it would've been... as bad as it was, it would've been much worse. ...by your strength, we are here, Lord God. So, Father God, we're standing on your word today... Church is supposed to be a safe zone. Even soldiers at war, churches are sacred, you don't touch them. Where were you shot? Um... both legs, b... this arm, both hands, and right here. He came for one person. That one person wasn't even there, and he's just killing everybody. It's not like we were gonna get out alive if somebody didn't get out or somebody distracted him, 'cause he came to play. Everybody in church that normally would conceal carry... because there's about five or so in the church that normally have a gun on them... all of them were gone that day. Let's talk about guns. How do you feel about guns? The day of calling 9-1-1 is no longer an option. You can either fight back or beg for mercy. He said take a, take a safety course on handling a firearm, so you can defend yourself until we get there. Right now, I'm carrying concealed. Show me. Special-made vest. Wait, I can't see. Oh, wait. Show me your weapon. How much ammunition do you have on you? I have 41 rounds. See, I got my magazines here, and over here. Do you always bring your gun to church? - Yeah. Yes. - Why? You don't know. You don't know where the threat's gonna come from. Nobody thought it was gonna happen here, and it happened. I mean, you don't know. The media loves to take the focus off God and put it into something secular, like gun control. It's kind of unfortunate that they'd rather push an agenda that really doesn't matter. Well, ultimately what matters is what people believe. Do you believe in something higher than yourself? Or do you just believe just random things happen to random people? It is not a gun control that this country needs, it's God control. And that's exactly what this country needs is God control. I was a Sunday school teacher. I'm the children's leader here. Everything that I have taught kids, everything that I have... learned about God, read about Jesus, all of that has to be the truth. And if it's not the truth, then all of it has been a lie. But God's hand was here with us. After the shooter walked out of the church building, there was actually a peace in the church, and I witnessed an actual cloud lift up out of the church. Now, my husband, who came in shortly... after said that I saw the smoke from the gunman's... from the gunman's gun. And, I said, yeah, the smoke from... was still in the church, but this was different. I felt like I witnessed the souls being accepted into Heaven. Both my sons were here, and... one is paralyzed and one was grazed. - How are they doing? - They're doing well. My older son, the one that is paralyzed, will probably have a year of out-patient rehab to get him to his max potential. He will walk again one day, for sure. But if it's here, we'll be excited, and if it's not, then we're okay with that too. - It would be in Heaven, you're saying? - Yep. One day in Heaven, he'll walk. We know that. God will put him whole again. I'm not worried about walking. I'm still... functional enough to serve God, and that's really all that matters. I'm still here, I'm still here for a purpose. You know, I wasn't left here because I was blessed. I wasn't left here because I was lucky. I was left here because God still has something for me to do. And if this is what we had to go through to bring one more person to know Christ, then it's all worth it. Okay. This is the dad and the mother. That's, uh, Bryan and Karla. Bryan is our son. And Danny is their second son, and he had a daughter, Noah, and she was a year old. She was buried with her dad. That's Greg. And that's the family. And, of course, Crystal was carrying a... a child. She... So, you lost eight, but you call it nine 'cause she was pregnant. We call it nine because she... she had an embryo. So... I just can't understand how you're so upbeat. Why? Because you lost nine members of your family! No, I didn't. They're in Heaven with Jesus. I mean, they're enjoying it. They're having fun. Don't look at the tragedy. Look at the joy that came from it. - Joy that came from it?! - Sure. - What joy comes from this?! - I'm just tickled to death that Bryan is already in... that Bryan and his family are already in Heaven. See, they're still there. If I'd lost them, yes, it would be, it would be terrible. I'd probably be bawling my eyes out right now, but I haven't lost them. They're just somewhere else. So, why haven't you cried? Because I don't have anything to cry about. After what that killer did to your family, you don't have hate - in your heart for him? - No. Why? Joy is so much better. There's just too much more to be happy for than there is to be sad about. Uh, there's too much more to love than there is to hate. So, concentrate on the love. This town is now on the map as a tragic location. I don't look at it as being a tragic location. We had a tragic event, but that didn't change Sutherland Springs. After spending Christmas in Sutherland Springs, it's clear that Americans live in a conflict between two narratives: the secular versus faith-based. Well, he's right about that. There are parallels between Roy Moore, the accused child molester, and Donald Trump, the accused and self-confessed, sexual assaulter, and so today... Down here, people like to tell me that they vote with their Bibles, which means they get behind candidates who support their Christian worldview. Perhaps this explains why so many Alabamians voted for Roy Moore, the Christian conservative accused of sexual misconduct. He did say, "total denial." Get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it. Many women here who voted for Roy Moore, and Donald Trump, told me they either don't believe or just don't care about claims of sexual harassment. Donald Trump says he's a man of God, but he doesn't act like a man of God in his personal life. When we're in the flesh, we don't act as Christian sometimes. And Trump is no different from any other Christian, you know. None of us are perfect, and all of us, at times, live in the flesh rather than in the spirit. So therefore, when we're in the flesh, Satan takes over. He claims to be a man of God, but there's no evidence of that in his personal life. Well, he doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. - Um... to my knowledge, he's... - But he pays porn stars! Does he do it now? Does he do it recently? Maybe he's done it in the past, and God's a forgiving god. Maybe he's asked for forgiveness for having done that in the past. You don't know. I don't know. It's really none of our business. But how do you feel about what's happening in America in terms of the women, the Me Too, all that? I think Me Too's silly. I wouldn't be a part of it. Here in rural Alabama, the women I met said the most important women's issue today is not the Me Too movement, it's the state amendment to recognize the sanctity of unborn life. There's gonna be something on the ballot that makes Alabama a pro-life state. - Is that important to you? - Yes, yes, it's very important to me. I think every life from conception is important. Yeah, I don't believe in killing the babies. I believe in letting them live. I'm against abortion. I think it's killing a human life. It's always been mind-boggling to me that people could be against the death penalty but for abortion. We don't vote Republican or Democrat. We vote what we feel like pulls closest to this. But, actually, we do try to get somebody in there that's actually gonna be Christian-based. - Morally. - Yeah. Even though some of them do their own little thing on the side. How do you feel about the whole Me Too movement? There's a big conversation in this country about how women are being treated. This is my personal view on that. Uh, I grew up in a bad situation, and... as women, we should be stronger than what has happened to us. Because if I can raise above everything else, and go on with my life, every woman should be able to. How old were you when you started having babies? I had my first at 16. And I got three, and there's, uh... Let's see, I was 16, 18, and 19. As a woman in Alabama in 2018... - Aw. - ...how does Alabama look? It's good! Look, I'm doing an all-male job right now, and I'm the only woman around that does pest control. So, how long have you been an exterminator? Altogether, I've been with this company for six months. I was with another company for two years, actually. So, I have a good bit of experience in it. Do you like being an exterminator? I love the people. I don't like it because there's no benefits with it. You know, you need insurance and stuff now, so... Sometimes the chemicals make you sick. They call it a chemical headache. I weighed 190 when I first started, and I probably weigh about 160 now. And the chemicals, you know, that's the benefits of it, 'cause I did lose a lot of weight. But, also, the chemicals make me kind of nauseated and sick a lot, and that's why Chuck wants me to get another job. Here in Alabama, do men have more say in their household? I think they do to a degree, yes. I do. And it's not a bad thing. I got a head of my house, and I'm not gonna overstep my boundaries with him, and women tend to do that nowadays. If we're talking about the Bible, the man should lead the woman. And God teaches us that, as women, we are supposed to be submissive to our husband. It says that. As a Christian woman voter, what issues matter to you? I don't believe in abortions, period. I mean, I was 16, raised my kids, and if you can't raise them, give them to someone who can, if you don't want them. That's where I'm at with that. But this is a Christian household, right? - Yes, ma'am. - And you voted for Trump 'cause he's a man of God, right? Uh, actually, I voted for him because I was just hoping somebody could go in there and do something different and make things better for everybody. Something's got to give in this society. I mean, something up there's got to give. They've got to give... the people that are not rich a chance. I mean, we're sinking, and, you know, like Chuck said, we make it day by day, wondering where we're gonna get our next meal at. Our economy, it was sucking... 'cause I was part of it. I was working a job that I was getting paid $7 an hour. - How old are you? - I am 47 years old. - And you got paid $7 an hour? - Yes, ma'am. - Is that legal? - Yeah, that's what we said. But... we wasn't too... I don't know. But the thing of it is, is... But how can you live on $7 an hour? You can't. That's the point. You can't live on what we're... That's why it takes two of us. My husband and I both have to work. Trump, to me, is our best option right now. And this is how... You wanna know how I feel? We're looking at it as maybe, he might... can lift this, the United States back up from poverty. 'Cause we are broke people here. We are suffering, and if he can do good for us, give him a chance. Let him be up there. I don't care what he does 'cause it's not for me to judge him, as long as he gets us back on our feet. Driving across this part of the country, the blue-collar workers I talked to said they feel ignored, dismissed, looked down upon by the coastal elites. Clearly, Donald Trump speaks to these people. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, one of our great natural resources. And our miners have been mistreated, and they're not being mistreated anymore. We're doing tremendous business. When you look at what's happening in West Virginia, you look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, you look at what's happening all over, it's like a, it's like a different world. This is the old 4 West Mine. This is the... Part of the mine here is gonna be shut down here pretty soon. Two weeks, this place will be no longer here. That's pretty sad to see this place go. I've been here for seven years. We thought, in the past, that that would be our, uh... our livelihood. But with everything that's going on in politics and stuff like that, they, you know, such a strain on coal, they kind of shut us down a little bit, so... I thought, I thought Trump was gonna save these jobs. Well, that's what I mean. Trump, Trump was, actually, he is saving jobs. Um, our coal mine shut down because we were doing some illegal things underground, and we got caught doing it... so, which we were fined for. We had two deaths at our mine, um, so, that kind of put a big damper on things for us. But did you vote for Trump because he told you he was gonna save coal mining jobs? - That was a big portion of it. - But you lost your job! Right. Um... So, and you still support him, even though you lost your job? Absolutely. Absolutely, I support industry. I believe in Trump because he supports, he supports me. Like, I feel like Trump personally supports me. Even though my mine's shut down, I feel like he, personally, supports me. Donald Trump came here, told people he was gonna save their jobs in this coal mine, and you just lost your job. In retrospect, also, Hillary Clinton also said that coal miners would also lose their jobs. So, if you contradict what she says, I mean, how can you, how can you vote for somebody that's gonna tell you flat out you're gonna lose your job? - Oh, I love this picture. - Yeah, ironworkers. So, this has special meaning for you? It does, yeah. That was the first picture I seen whenever I walked in, the first day in the training center. - Why is Trump so popular here? - Blue-collar jobs. Everybody around here, it's all blue-collar work. It's, most people... There isn't enough things in our area to where we can have a hundred lawyers, and we can have a hundred judges. Most, most people around here don't go to college. It was all straight out of high school, straight to work, and... Honestly, around here, it's not even straight out of high school. It's straight out of junior high. Me and most of my friends were, ever since we was, we was old enough to run a shovel, most of our parents are, "Hey, here. Go do this." So, honestly, work is my biggest issue to where I voted for Trump because that affects me directly. We need to make sure that, at the end of every day, we don't have to worry about losing our house. We don't have to worry about not be able to make it to work 'cause our vehicle breaks. When March 2nd comes around, I'm gonna try to find another coal mine that'll hire me. I'm gonna continue coal mining. Um, I guess, once you become a coal miner, you're always a coal miner. This is one of the old mines from Bobtown that shut down, probably, I'd say, 20, 30 years ago. Kind of what our industry's becoming, just kind of... old and rundown. But people don't understand, that's what keeps our country going. There's a portal right there. That's where the guys would go in the mine, right here. This is where the guys would come in and out. They would bring supplies in, equipment. Um, I don't know if you can... You can't really see down the tunnel, but there's old train tracks right here. It's a trolley, it's an old trolley mine, so they would bring in stuff on trolleys, stuff like that. This is it. You get down there further and that's where the guys would mine coal. Dude, this is cool. I've never been in a coal mine before. You're fucking crazy, Brooklyn. This is, this is what it's about, right here. This is, this is guys coming out every day. This is, this is what we do. This is, this is our life. This is every day for us. This is... another day at the office, basically, but this is our office, underground. This is what we do. So, you can see the smile on my face, just... I love it, love being underground. Yeah, that's from the old mine right there. Was that why Trump resonated with you? 'Cause he said he was gonna save the coal jobs? Yeah. I mean, I respect him 'cause of that. I just, I just respect that somebody actually took us in consideration about coal mining and how important we are to the world and our country. He gave you a voice? Yeah. He gave us a voice, absolutely. We're just kind of saying our last goodbyes, all the guys that got laid off today. Talking about where they're gonna go from here, and their effects on the family, with the mine shutting down. Uh... I'll probably never see half of these guys again ever in my life, but, uh, the time we spent together was something I'll never forget. Today is my last night at the 4 West. It sucks. You know, losing a job. Have to go to another one. You know, find another one. Lot of guys can't find them. Lot of guys are too old to find them. You know, you feel bad. They're hard workers. So, it sucks. I was upset, because I've been working here seven years, and, you know, everything I have is because of 4 West. If they wanna reduce coal mining jobs, it's stupid. I feel pretty good about America with Trump being in there. I don't really agree with all the feminists, and the leftists, and... I think a lot of them just, pretty bluntly, are retarded. They don't... They don't understand what it is to be an American. They just want everything handed to them. They don't wanna actually go out and work for it. Old Trump, man, he's gonna make America great again. He is a man for the blue-collar guy. Three-quarters of America is on an access card, and a quarter of them is working. So, what, what's the big definition of that? The minority's supporting the majority. - There you go. - Yes! There you go. You people think us Pennsylvanians are a bunch of hillbillies, hicks, ain't got nothing. Right there's 20 grand. There's 20 grand. There's 30. We spend thousands of dollars to come out in the woods and drink beer. Everybody has their own opinion, and it doesn't agree with anybody else. America is more divided now than it probably has been... ever. We are in so many pieces that you might as well pick up these leaves and try to rebuild that tree. Coal workers look at the industry as a way to feed their families. Without coal, places like Bobtown would die. But in the liberal worldview, coal is the enemy of the environment, and environmentalists blame the industry every time there's a natural disaster. When Hurricane Harvey hit the Gulf Coast region, it was one of the most expensive natural disasters in US history. It destroyed homes and shut down businesses, here, in the heart of America's petrochemical industry. All of this with the global warming, and the... a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax. Is this ground zero for Hurricane Harvey? This is ground zero right here. We had over 54 inches of water here, in Port Arthur. And so many people were devastated by this, this storm, but... - It feels like a ghost town! - Yeah, it does. I mean, this neighborhood had tons of kids running around. This was vibrant and full of life. To see it like this is, is heartbreaking. This is the third hurricane, a really major one, in the past 10 years, so, we're crawling back. You know, our people are blue-collar, hardworking, but it takes a while to recover from one of these things. With all due respect, your town looks dead. Yeah. So, you need those refineries. Yeah. Here in Port Arthur, what we do is oil and gas. We do refining. We refine over a million barrels of oil a day. If there is such a thing as global warming, and the ice caps melt, - your town is the first to go. - Yeah. Do people in this town believe in global warming? You know, with so many obstacles our citizens have to face here, in Port Arthur, they don't have the luxury of worrying about global warming. The thing that's affecting people's lives more than anything else right now in Port Arthur is the lack of jobs. If I could put some food on people's plates, I think that's the most important thing. Not global warming? Not global warming, not at this time. No, ma'am. It couldn't be. This is, basically, Refinery Row, is kind of what I would call it. We have Motiva, Exxon Mobil, Chevron's out here. I think it's Motiva on the left, Valero on the right. So, these are the refineries that are causing global warming. Says you. Just 'cause you say it, doesn't make it true. Now, look behind you. Does it look like they're belching pollution out of you... out of it? You know, look at the skies. Your own eyes tell you that's a lie. You don't need me to say that. Does the air smell unpalatable here? Slight scent of sulfur, but that's about it. These plants do not produce enough crap to cause the climate to change, and for you to think so just advertises your ignorance. We found, during the BP oil spill that there are enzymes and microbes in the ocean that eat those and survive because of the oil in the sea. This planet can absorb what we give it, and, like a good woman, you know, you give us a seed, we give you back a child. You give the planet seeds, it gives you back abundance. Why do you find fault in that abundance? Do you really think you're gonna impact life by taking us back technologically a hundred years? Do you really wanna live with horses and buggies instead of cars? Oh, we're not gonna have any petroleum products because the climate might warm up by a couple of degrees? One thing after Harvey, nobody was pointing any fingers. We were all reaching out hands. And we all just did everything that we could to help our neighbors. Right after the hurricane, I immediately went into cooking mode. The Friday after the storm, our Beaumont location was the only restaurant in town open. So, my... my contribution to recovery was just cooking, so people could focus on recovery. So, how do I know who's still homeless from the hurricane? 'Cause they have trailers in their yard or you can see their windows are vacant. There's more, more construction activity than a new neighborhood. It just doesn't stop. That's their life out there by that travel trailer, see? Okay, let's talk about Texas politics. - Mm-kay. - This is bubble-to-bubble. When we had Hurricane Sandy, your senators voted against giving aid to us. And then when you guys had a hurricane, they all wanted handouts. - They voted to get FEMA money. - Well, that's human nature. - That's hypocrisy! - Well, that's human nature, too. I don't wanna pay for your hurricane anymore than you wanna pay for my hurricane. How about we take the federal government out of the equation? It's... detrimental to self-sufficiency to have Big Daddy Government step in and put a bandage over every boo-boo. Do you feel like there are two Americas? - Absolutely. - Do you think this country's divided? Absolutely. Clearly, along ideological, political lines. You're either a progressive, and you want a big-daddy government to run your life, or you're a freedom-loving American, and Big Daddy Government, it needs to get out of your life. One of those two things is the dichotomy where we're at. We're in an epic battle for the soul of the United States right now. When we first opened up after Harvey, we were serving 2,000 people an hour, until we closed. And then the... Despite all the talk about political tribalism, everywhere I went, at the end of the day, they always invited me to dinner. Wow. By his hands, we are fed. Thank you, Lord, for our daily bread. - Amen. - Let's eat. Eat! Hey! - Get it! Get it! Get it! - Hey! Harvey has brought a change in so many of us. The beauty of it was is it brought us all together. We were all in one mind and one accord, determined that we were gonna work together, and make this city come back to be the way it used to be. I feel, in my heart, that God is trying to wake us up. - So you don't believe in global warming? - No, ma'am. Why did God flood your town and make you all homeless? Uh, read the Bible. I mean, what did he do with Sodom and Gomorrah? Um, look, I mean, he warned Noah, and... Um, I'm not saying that God... He allows things to happen. If you don't believe in global warming, then it had to be God. So, why did God flood your town? The Bible is clear that storms will come. So, while I don't believe that God did this to me, I believe that God is with us during the storm. He'll never leave us, he'll never forsake us, and he will see us through, despite the storms that come in our life. The word of God says that we're gonna have signs and wonders that's gonna start to happen on the last days. I believe that Harvey was a, um, a sign of the times, but I don't think it was Armageddon. Of course. I think that's down the way. It's coming, I do believe that's gonna happen in our world. We'll see it, but I don't think Harvey was Armageddon, no. But it does feel like the end times around here. Well, that's only because you gotta keep looking up, sis. I'm believing that our city, yeah, it got flooded, but you know what? We said it got baptized. My son said it, and I believe it's true. Baptism is, I mean, the old man dies and the new man rises, and I'm believing that's the same thing for Port Arthur, Texas. It was flooded, yes, but we're calling it baptized. All the old things that needed to be washed away is gone, and it's gonna rise up to be the best, greatest city that it's ever been before. That's what I believe. We say it's climate change and they say it's God's will. And even though the Bible doesn't mention greenhouse gas emissions, we will undoubtedly continue to disagree about this until the end times. While towns like this wait to be reborn, many look to President Trump to alleviate their economic anxiety. But that's not the only reason why they support him. Many Southerners told me that they feel like their culture is being threatened, and Donald Trump acknowledged the cultural anxiety of feeling like a stranger in your own country. The United States of America, the modern United States of America, has a stubborn problem with Neo-Nazism and overt, violent white supremacy. Southern culture is frequently symbolized by Confederate markers that you can see all across the South. And the debate over Confederate iconography has become one of the ways we debate race in America today. This is Charlottesville, the college town that became ground zero of America's race war, when a group of neo-Nazis came to town to protest the city council's decision to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. When they clashed with counter-protesters, the president blamed everyone involved, empowering the white nationalists. I think there's blame on both sides. You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. After the cameras left, the city council voted to cover the statues with black tarps until the court decides if these statues should be removed. How do you feel about taking the statue down? I think the statue should stay. I don't think the statue should go anywhere. You know, I don't want my son to think that... just because everybody else doesn't like something, that somebody can come in and tear it down. I want my son to grow up to know that, you know, whether it's good or bad, our past is our past and it's happened. I feel that they put that there for a reason. You know, just because one set of people don't like it, doesn't mean we need to tear it down. I mean, that's just somebody else's belief. You know, I mean, as much money has been put into this whole situation with this statue, we got vets sleeping on benches here. You know, I mean, why don't you guys put some effort into helping the veterans that can't find a place to live or a job or something like that instead of doing this dumb shit, where you're tearing statues down? I mean, it makes no sense to me. What you're saying is just because you defend the statue, - doesn't mean you're a racist. - Yeah. Just because I'm bald-headed and have a goatee, doesn't make me a redneck. You know what I mean? I mean... I believe in just as much as everybody else does. I just don't feel that our history should be affected by the opinions of people in one town. We're at a crossroad anyway, the strange times that we're living in, so... What do mean, crossroads? Nobody wants to see color, but if you're white, then you're on the downside, I guess, you know? That, I don't know, that we're the ones giving up everything and everybody else is gaining, so... It's just interesting. And so, we came here from North Carolina just to see it, you know, to see a big ol' bag. - What do you think this is a symbol of? - The South. So, what is it that you think people don't understand about the South? Is that we wanted to be our own country. At one time, you know? And I think it'd have been fine if there'd been a North and South United States. Why should we protect these monuments? Because they're veterans' monuments. I'm doing it on the sides that these are American veterans. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, are certainly American veterans. The Confederate statue behind us, that's a veterans' statue. And so, to us, the Southerners, it's a very personal situation. It sounds like you're still fighting the Civil War here. Well, it's real to us. Particularly, if somebody comes, tries to take these statues down that represents your family who died. Many of the places here, the blood stains are still on the ground, so to speak. In other words, they are still there. They're sacred places to us. These monuments were put up by grieving people, who had just had a devastating war. And look it. "Love makes memory eternal." They were grieving. This is a grieving situation here. You don't destroy the past just 'cause you don't like it or you haven't read about it. We're not the Taliban. We don't tear down statues and monuments to people who've come before us. We learn from our history, and we celebrate our history. For me, it's a censorship issue. That's one of the first things that personally occurred to me. My God, what do you mean, take the monuments down? This is like book burning. I can't believe we're even talking about that. That it's okay just to, for a small group of people to tell me what I can see. If you try to talk to about history and lack of censorship and so on, then you're just a racist. Anyone who disagrees with these people is a racist and a white supremacist, and that has effectively silenced moderate voices in this community. They're literally afraid to show up. Are you a racist? - No, I'm not a racist. - Are you a white supremacist? No, I'm not a white supremacist, I'm a preservationist. And our position is you don't tear things down. You add to the narrative. You add to what's there. You enhance what is there. You contextualize what is there. And if you remove those statues, you've taken away a piece of Charlottesville for ideological reasons and reasons that don't reflect the reality of what was happening in Charlottesville when those statues went up, or what has happened in the almost a hundred years since then. Charlottesville has turned into a hashtag. Ah, yes. People think of Charlottesville, and they think of Nazis marching in the streets. That's because we've probably have had them. You know? But, let's stop just thinking about the hashtag and start thinking. I think it is the absolute duty of every citizen in this country to thoroughly understand the people who disagree with you. You cannot understand them in a hashtag environment. I often think that Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, and all those various social media, they're destroying democracy because they're destroying our ability to talk to one another face-to-face, in a rational way. The court ordered those tarps to come off in Charlottesville, so now those Confederate statues stand as a testimony to our nation's ideological divide. No one was ever under the illusion that the scars of racism healed in this country, but that fringy group of neo-Nazis reminded us that hate is still alive and well in America, and cable news is escalating the conflict by pouring fuel on the fire, continuing to feed us this narrative that we're a nation at war with ourselves. Everywhere you go, people are just regurgitating this: right versus left, Hollywood versus the heartland, faith-based versus secular, haves versus have-nots, natives versus the undocumented. We live on opposite sides of a political divide, and the wall runs through it. We're gonna have strong borders. We're gonna have the wall. We're building the wall. We're building the wall, folks. We're building the wall. We're going to build a wall! It's going to be built. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Build that wall... To ensure that my own kids learn how to think outside the bubble, I'm taking them to see the wall. The wall just got 10 feet higher! We are Trump's welcoming committee. You are it. He is landing in Brown Field in less than an hour, most likely, and he's heading to that border and he's gonna look at those walls. I don't disagree with immigration at all, but I do agree that you need to know who it is that's coming into the country. We need to protect our country. We got a lot of people here that shouldn't be here. So far, I think, President Trump is the greatest president in my lifetime. This is the day that Trump's base had been waiting for. The president is here to check out the prototypes of his infamous wall. God bless Donald Trump for coming to the state. The leftist, communist, anti- Americans that are in this state that are demonizing him, shame on you. But, God bless our patriots for coming out. God bless our president. Build the wall. Protect American citizens first. Protect American sovereignty first. Restore the rule of law, and we will take this country back. The reason we need barriers, the reason we put a double layer fence in San Diego, was to keep criminal aliens out of America, illegal aliens out of America. When they put that fence up, illegal alien border crossings in this area decreased by over 90%. So, you are now in the most southwest part of the contiguous United States. As you see, this is where the fence enters the water for the border between Mexico and the United States. We call this area, oddly enough, "bunkers." Please don't fall in. That's three stories down. I don't really wanna write the memo. In my America, people think the wall is an enormous waste of money. Why do we need a wall? Um, when you're dealing with somebody, your nanny, or the person that's cleaning, and if they're here illegally, most of those people you're dealing with are gonna be good people. So, that's the prism you're looking at it from. But that's not everybody. Now, people on the far right will say that everybody is a murderer and rapist. That's not the whole truth and nothing but the truth either. There's an, actually, a middle, which is more honest. What we deal with down here is cartels and gangbangers and criminals, and we know there's bad people out there that wanna do bad things to this country. The southwest border, we arrest, 35% of the people we arrest, statistically, are criminal aliens. They've been in the US, they've committed crimes, and they've been deported. In our area, it's up to 70%. You're not seeing that, but it doesn't mean what you're seeing is wrong. It's just, you're not seeing the whole picture. I am gonna take you to two more places, and one is gonna show you how it works, having the infrastructure, and one is gonna show you how problematic it is when we have no infrastructure. So, this is the first location I wanted to bring you, Smuggler's Gulch. The name tells you everything. It's been a smuggling route into this country for 200 years. That berm you're seeing there, and that fence, did not exist for the first two-thirds of my career. So, having this here now is where I wanted to show you that the infrastructure is extremely helpful and extremely successful in closing off part of the border, that was called Smuggler's Gulch. So, you think this location is proof that we need the wall? I think that it's proof that it works. I'm gonna take you to an area next, where you're gonna see where the Tijuana River flows into the United States. There's no wall there. There's no barrier there. So, this is the Tijuana River valley. And this is what's called the channel. That's the Tijuana River. You probably can smell a bit of it right now. There's a mix of sewage and chemicals. But what's really important with this, besides the chemicals and the sewage is that yellow line is the border. There is no wall, there is no fence. That's Mexico. You just walk in, and you're in the United States. So, you have to have an agent there. That agent is the wall. You have to waste your manpower of a guy who can't go anywhere. He has to stay there. The minute he leaves, they'll come through. You can't see 'em, but there's people in here. There's a guy right there. What's that guy doing? Hanging out. He's probably deportados, somebody who was deported. So, that guy's just walking into America right now? He's gonna hit America in about seven or eight steps. He is now entering illegally into the United States. Yep. There's nothing to stop him there. Why don't we do anything? Why don't you go chase him? Because the minute the agent goes to chase him, he'll run back three feet into Mexico, and then throw rocks at us. So, what's the point? So, the takeaway is understanding the difference between border security and immigration reform, and that there is nothing inherently wrong or evil or any of that about border security. We secure things that we care about. We secure things that we want to protect. We secure things that we love, and there is nothing inherently wrong with doing that. We support legal immigration. We want people that come to this country that want to be here, but if you break into this country, if you break into this country, and you commit crimes, you should be deported. It's pretty simple. If you don't respect this country, get the hell out. Or expect to be deported. That, that's... it's simple. It's simple. Attention, attention! Trump is no racist. No matter how much they tell you, Trump is not racist. You get out there, and you just, - preach the word of Trump, huh? - Preach it, well, and we do different things. So, sometimes, we confront the left. Sometimes we infiltrate, we go in disguise, and then we question. Build it. Build it. Donald Trump represented somebody who said, wait a second! My job's to protect these guys. I don't care about you. I don't care about the, the special interests. I care about these people. If this wall protects these people, then build the wall! Fight Sanctuary State. Say, "Fight Sanctuary State!" - - Build the wall! - Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! To me, the wall is a symbol of everything that America is not. It's about keeping people out. You and I do not agree on anything. - Yeah. - Can we agree on one thing? The Mexicans are not paying for this wall. I don't care. If Mexico doesn't pay for this wall, I don't care. I just wanna see the wall get built. I was... When I heard Donald Trump say Mexico's gonna pay for it, I thought, hell yeah! Make Mexico pay for it. - Now... - But they're not gonna pay for it! But, they, well, they may. They may. - No, they won't! Come on! They will not! - They may. They may. Wait, what do you think my America needs to learn about your America? Your America is a bubble. We are in the middle of a civil war, that hasn't been declared yet. If we can't even secure our borders from keeping criminals, even, even terrorists from coming into our country, we no longer have a country. So, for those who say we are not in a civil war, you are blind. There goes a, there goes a punk who stole my hat. We are in the midst of a cultural civil war, and the next step will be bloodshed, I'm afraid. These are the fascists here that call us... That call the right the fascists... I go to events to expose the lies, to expose the left for who they truly are. And then they're cowards, and they stand behind their face masks. So, you're one of Trump's warriors? You're out there fighting his civil war. You get punched in the face by cowards... Yeah, I'm an American warrior. You get hit in the fucking head by cowards. I went to Berkley and got hit over the head. Is this what the left believes in? This guy, is this... Is this justified? So, you've shed blood over this Trump civil war? - I've shed blood. - Back off. This motherfucker keeps hitting people in the head with a stick. We had the anti-American Marxist people that are trying to undermine this country. They're really, I call them, "Nancy Pelosi's grandchildren." This is what you get. This is what you get with the left. This is what you get with the left. I think I need to introduce you to someone. Come on, come on. Get your stroller! There's some people I want you to meet. Nancy Pelosi's grandchildren, ladies andgentlemen! Nancy Pelosi's real grandchildren. - Hello. - You don't have a mask on today. That's interesting. Do you usually... do you guys usually... No, I'm just kidding. No, you guys are good guys. Good guys. So, anyway, hold on! I get to speak, I'm their mother! - This guy says... - Is this a setup? - Is this the setup? - His life's work... No. 'Cause this guy's work is to do... He's at war. When I asked him if this country's at war, he said he's at war with Nancy Pelosi's grandchildren. What do you guys think of that? - That's not right, that's not true. - I don't think you would win the war. - Oh! - I... I like, I like the... I like the... Why do you hate my children, Ben? I don't know if anyone really hates me. I don't think they should. 'Cause I just wanna build sandcastles on the beach. I didn't do anything. So, are you guys violent, Marxist leftists? No. We're just kid who likes... We're just kids who like building sandcastles. You know, and I love that you like building walls. I think Donald Trump could use you. Actually meeting the true grandchildren gives me hope for the future. That they're not all violent, Marxist leftists. It's such an, it's such an honor to meet you guys, and to hang with you. It worries me that our children have limited encounters with people who don't think like they do. We've become politically segregated. So, how do we teach our kids to accommodate each other's narratives... Open minds. ...and coexist with people who we don't agree with? Back here in Sutherland Springs on Easter Sunday, where they're celebrating the Resurrection, we can see how it's possible to heal after a terrible tragedy. It begs the question, how can this country repair our emotionally polarized national life to resurrect the idea of America as the world's most stable democracy? Come give a heart to remind people that they must give their heart to Jesus. We can start by listening to our fellow Americans, and thinking outside of our own bubbles, so that we can attempt to heal what divides us. Hallelujah! Subtitles by explosiveskull
